OBJECTIVE: OUR AIM WAS TO DETERMINE OMALIZUMAB SAFETY AND EFFICACY IN CRSWNP IN PHASE 3 TRIALS (POLYP 1 AND POLYP 2). METHODS: ADULTS WITH CRSWNP WITH INADEQUATE RESPONSE TO INTRANASAL CORTICOSTEROIDS WERE RANDOMIZED (1:1) TO OMALIZUMAB OR PLACEBO AND INTRANASAL MOMETASONE FOR 24 WEEKS. COPRIMARY END POINTS INCLUDED CHANGE FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 24 IN NASAL POLYP SCORE (NPS) AND NASAL CONGESTION SCORE. SECONDARY END POINTS INCLUDED CHANGE FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 24 IN SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22) SCORE, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA SMELL IDENTIFICATION TEST, SENSE OF SMELL, POSTNASAL DRIP, RUNNY NOSE, AND ADVERSE EVENTS. RESULTS: PATIENTS IN POLYP 1 (N = 138) AND POLYP 2 (N = 127) EXHIBITED SEVERE CRSWNP AND SUBSTANTIAL QUALITY OF LIFE IMPAIRMENT EVIDENCED BY A MEAN NPS HIGHER THAN 6 AND SNOT-22 SCORE OF APPROXIMATELY 60.

THIS DISCOVERY HAS TRIGGERED NEW RESEARCH AROUND TREATMENTS TARGETING SPECIFIC CYTOKINES DRIVING INFLAMMATION IN CRSWNP LIKE IL-4, IL-13, IL-5 AND IGE. BIOLOGICALS ARE INCREASINGLY TESTED AS ADDITIONAL TRE- ATMENT FOR PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM SEVERE CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITH NASAL POLYPS (CRSWNP). THEIR EFFICACY HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN MULTIPLE STUDIES. ALL STUDIES DIFFER IN TERMS OF BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS OF INCLUDED PATIENTS AND OUTCOME PARAMETERS ANALYSED. AIMS: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE EFFICACY OF REPORTED BIOLOGICALS FOR CRSWNP BASED ON THE PUBLISHED DATA FOR PHASE 2 AND 3 STUDIES. THE AIM WAS TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW ACROSS THE DIFFERENT BIOLOGICALS AND OUTCOME PARAMETERS. METHODS: IN A FIRST STEP WE CRITICALLY SELECTED OUT OF ALL AVAILABLE PHASE 2 AND 3 CLINICAL TRIALS THE ONES CONTAINING THE MOST RIGOROUS AND COMPATIBLE STUDY DESIGNS. MEANING STUDIES THAT COMPLY WITH A NEED FOR A CLEAR DEFINITION OF CRSWNP, AT LEAST TWO ADMINISTRA- TION DOSES, COMPARABLE TIMEFRAMES AND THE SAME OUTCOME PARAMETERS STUDIED. THIS ASSESSMENT WAS PERFORMED USING A PRISMA SEARCH. WE RETAINED 7 STUDIES WITH SIGNIFICANT DATA FOR DUPILUMAB, MEPOLIZUMAB AND OMALIZUMAB. IN A SECOND STEP THE EFFECT-SIZES OF TREATMENT WITH THOSE BIOLOGICALS WERE COMPARED FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT OUTCOME PARAMETERS BOTH PATIENT RELEVANT (NASAL CON- GESTION, SMELL LOSS AND SNOT-22 SCORES) AND PATIENT IRRELEVANT (CT SCAN LUND-MACKAY, SMELL TEST AND NASAL POLYP SCORES). THERAPY DURATION OF 16 TO 25 WEEKS WAS CHOSEN FOR EVALUATION OF EFFICACY. RESULTS: A DIRECT COMPARISON OF EFFICACY BETWEEN DUPILUMAB, MEPOLIZUMAB AND OMALIZUMAB IS CHALLENGING GIVEN DIFFERENCES IN INCLUSION CRITERIA, OUTCOME PARAMETERS AND TIME-POINTS OF ANALYSES. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT EFFECT SIZES OF DUPILUMAB, MEPOLIZUMAB AND OMALIZUMAB SEEM LARGE ENOUGH TO REFLECT A MAJOR REDUCTION IN SYMPTOM BURDEN AS EXPERIENCED BY PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM REFRACTORY CRSWNP. THE EFFECT SIZE OF DUPILUMAB ON BOTH PATIENT RELEVANT AND PATIENT IRRELEVANT PARAMETERS OF SMELL LOSS ARE CLEARLY SIGNIFICANT AND REFLECT THE CLINICAL EXPERIENCE OF MAJOR REDUCTION OF SMELL IMPAIRMENT IN TREATED PATIENTS. CONCLUSION: DESPITE THE HETEROGENEITY OF PROTOCOLS, DOSAGES AND TIME-POINTS OF ANALYSES OF BIOLOGICAL TRIALS IN CRSWNP, THIS OVER- VIEW HIGHLIGHTS OUTCOMES OF BIOLOGICAL TREATMENT IN CRSWNP IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY. REAL-LIFE REGISTRIES, COMPARATIVE TRIALS AND/ OR ENDOTYPE-DRIVEN TREATMENT PLANS ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE THE ANSWERS TO THE MULTIPLE QUESTIONS THAT ARE STILL OPEN TODAY.","DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS LEUVEN, LEUVEN, BELGIUM; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL GHENT, LABORATORY OF UPPER AIRWAY RESEARCH, GHENT, BELGIUM;DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTRE (AMC), AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS LEUVEN, LEUVEN, BELGIUM.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTRE (AMC), AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021/01/18 12:14","20210413",NA,2021,"2021/01/19 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,"0300-0729 (PRINT) 0300-0729 (LINKING)","0347242","RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.4193/RHIN20.570 [DOI]","20210414","2021/04/14 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","151-163","NETHERLANDS",NA,NA,"33459728","PPUBLISH","2P471X1Z11 (OMALIZUMAB)","IM",NA,"RHINOLOGY. 2021 APR 1;59(2):151-163.

THE STUDY CONSISTED OF FIVE PHASES: ITEM GENERATION, RELIABILITY ANALYSIS, NORMATIVE DATA GENERATION, VALIDITY ANALYSIS AND RESPONSIVENESS ANALYSIS. THE ITEM GENERATION PHASE FOLLOWED THE FIVE-STEP, CROSS-CULTURAL, ADAPTATION PROCESS OF TRANSLATION AND BACK-TRANSLATION. A GROUP OF 222 PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS) WERE ENROLLED FOR THE INTERNAL CONSISTENCY ANALYSIS. SIXTY PATIENTS COMPLETED THE I-SNOT-22 TWICE, 2 WEEKS APART, FOR TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY ANALYSIS. A GROUP OF 119 ASYMPTOMATIC SUBJECTS COMPLETED THE I-SNOT-22 FOR NORMATIVE DATA GENERATION. I-SNOT-22 SCORES OBTAINED BY CRS PATIENTS AND ASYMPTOMATIC SUBJECTS WERE COMPARED FOR VALIDITY ANALYSIS. I-SNOT-22 SCORES WERE CORRELATED WITH LUND-MACKAY AND VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) SCORES IN 50 CRS PATIENTS FOR CRITERION VALIDITY ANALYSIS. FINALLY, I-SNOT-22 SCORES OBTAINED IN A GROUP OF 59 CRS PATIENTS BEFORE AND AFTER SURGICAL TREATMENT FOR CRS WERE COMPARED FOR RESPONSIVENESS ANALYSIS. ALL THE ENROLLED SUBJECTS MANAGED TO COMPLETE THE I-SNOT-22 WITHOUT NEEDING ANY ASSISTANCE. INTERNAL CONSISTENCY WAS SATISFACTORY (<U+0391> = 0.86). TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY WAS ALSO SATISFACTORY (ICC = 0.85). A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE I-SNOT-22 SCORES BETWEEN THE CRS PATIENTS AND THE ASYMPTOMATIC SUBJECTS WAS FOUND (P < 0.008). POSITIVE SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS WERE FOUND BETWEEN I-SNOT-22 AND VAS SCORES, WHILE NO SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS WERE FOUND BETWEEN I-SNOT-22 SCORES AND LUND-MACKAY SCORES. I-SNOT-22 SCORES OBTAINED IN THE PRE-TREATMENT CONDITION WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THOSE OBTAINED AFTER SURGERY.

CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS IS COMMON. IT IS CHARACTERISED BY INFLAMMATION OF THE NASAL AND SINUS LININGS, NASAL BLOCKAGE, RHINORRHOEA, FACIAL PRESSURE/PAIN AND LOSS OF SENSE OF SMELL. IT OCCURS WITH OR WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS.   'BIOLOGICS' ARE MEDICINAL PRODUCTS PRODUCED BY A BIOLOGICAL PROCESS. MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES ARE ONE TYPE, ALREADY EVALUATED IN OTHER INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS (E.G. ASTHMA AND ATOPIC DERMATITIS). OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF BIOLOGICS FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS. SEARCH METHODS: THE COCHRANE ENT INFORMATION SPECIALIST SEARCHED THE COCHRANE ENT REGISTER; CENTRAL (2020, ISSUE 9); OVID MEDLINE; OVID EMBASE; WEB OF SCIENCE; CLINICALTRIALS.GOV; ICTRP AND ADDITIONAL SOURCES FOR PUBLISHED AND UNPUBLISHED STUDIES. THE DATE OF THE SEARCH WAS 28 SEPTEMBER 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) WITH AT LEAST THREE MONTHS FOLLOW-UP COMPARING BIOLOGICS (MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES) AGAINST PLACEBO/NO TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: WE USED STANDARD COCHRANE METHODOLOGICAL PROCEDURES. OUR PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE DISEASE-SPECIFIC HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQL), DISEASE SEVERITY AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAES). THE SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE AVOIDANCE OF SURGERY, EXTENT OF DISEASE (MEASURED BY ENDOSCOPIC OR COMPUTERISED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) SCORE), GENERIC HRQL AND ADVERSE EFFECTS (NASOPHARYNGITIS, INCLUDING SORE THROAT). WE USED GRADE TO ASSESS THE CERTAINTY OF THE EVIDENCE FOR EACH OUTCOME. MAIN RESULTS: WE INCLUDED 10 STUDIES. OF 1262 ADULT PARTICIPANTS, 1260 HAD SEVERE CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITH NASAL POLYPS; 43% TO 100% OF PARTICIPANTS ALSO HAD ASTHMA. THREE BIOLOGICS, WITH DIFFERENT TARGETS, WERE EVALUATED: DUPILUMAB, MEPOLIZUMAB AND OMALIZUMAB. ALL OF THE STUDIES WERE SPONSORED OR SUPPORTED BY INDUSTRY. FOR THIS UPDATE (2021) WE HAVE INCLUDED TWO NEW STUDIES, INCLUDING 265 PARTICIPANTS, WHICH REPORTED DATA RELATING TO OMALIZUMAB. ANTI-IL-4R<U+0391> MAB (DUPILUMAB) VERSUS PLACEBO/NO TREATMENT (ALL RECEIVING INTRANASAL STEROIDS) THREE STUDIES (784 PARTICIPANTS) EVALUATED DUPILUMAB. DISEASE-SPECIFIC HRQL WAS MEASURED WITH THE SNOT-22 (A 22-ITEM QUESTIONNAIRE, WITH A SCORE RANGE OF 0 TO 110; MINIMAL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE (MCID) 8.9 POINTS). AT 24 WEEKS, DUPILUMAB RESULTS IN A LARGE REDUCTION (IMPROVEMENT) IN THE SNOT-22 SCORE (MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) -19.61, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) -22.54 TO -16.69; 3 STUDIES; 784 PARTICIPANTS; HIGH CERTAINTY). AT BETWEEN 16 AND 52 WEEKS OF FOLLOW-UP, DUPILUMAB PROBABLY RESULTS IN A LARGE REDUCTION IN DISEASE SEVERITY, AS MEASURED BY A 0- TO 10-POINT VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) (MD -3.00, 95% CI -3.47 TO -2.53; 3 STUDIES; 784 PARTICIPANTS; MODERATE CERTAINTY). THIS IS A GLOBAL SYMPTOM SCORE, INCLUDING ALL ASPECTS OF CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS SYMPTOMS. AT BETWEEN 16 AND 52 WEEKS OF FOLLOW-UP, DUPILUMAB MAY RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS COMPARED TO PLACEBO (5.9% VERSUS 12.5%, RISK RATIO (RR) 0.47, 95% CI 0.29 TO 0.76; 3 STUDIES, 782 PARTICIPANTS; LOW CERTAINTY). ANTI-IL-5 MAB (MEPOLIZUMAB) VERSUS PLACEBO/NO TREATMENT (ALL RECEIVING INTRANASAL STEROIDS) TWO STUDIES (137 PARTICIPANTS) EVALUATED MEPOLIZUMAB. DISEASE-SPECIFIC HRQL WAS MEASURED WITH THE SNOT-22. AT 25 WEEKS, THE SNOT-22 SCORE MAY BE REDUCED (IMPROVED) IN PARTICIPANTS RECEIVING MEPOLIZUMAB (MD -13.26 POINTS, 95% CI -22.08 TO -4.44; 1 STUDY; 105 PARTICIPANTS; LOW CERTAINTY; MCID 8.9).  IT IS VERY UNCERTAIN WHETHER THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN DISEASE SEVERITY AT 25 WEEKS: ON A 0- TO 10-POINT VAS, DISEASE SEVERITY WAS -2.03 LOWER IN THOSE RECEIVING MEPOLIZUMAB (95% CI -3.65 TO -0.41; 1 STUDY; 72 PARTICIPANTS; VERY LOW CERTAINTY). IT IS VERY UNCERTAIN IF THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS AT BETWEEN 25 AND 40 WEEKS (1.4% VERSUS 0%; RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.07 TO 35.46; 2 STUDIES; 135 PARTICIPANTS, VERY LOW CERTAINTY). ANTI-IGE MAB (OMALIZUMAB) VERSUS PLACEBO/NO TREATMENT (ALL RECEIVING INTRANASAL STEROIDS) FIVE STUDIES (329 PARTICIPANTS) EVALUATED OMALIZUMAB. DISEASE-SPECIFIC HRQL WAS MEASURED WITH THE SNOT-22. AT 24 WEEKS OMALIZUMAB PROBABLY RESULTS IN A LARGE REDUCTION IN SNOT-22 SCORE (MD -15.62, 95% CI -19.79 TO -11.45; 2 STUDIES; 265 PARTICIPANTS; MODERATE CERTAINTY; MCID 8.9). WE DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY EVIDENCE FOR OVERALL DISEASE SEVERITY. IT IS VERY UNCERTAIN WHETHER OMALIZUMAB AFFECTS THE NUMBER OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS, WITH FOLLOW-UP BETWEEN 20 AND 26 WEEKS (0.8% VERSUS 2.5%, RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.05 TO 2.00; 5 STUDIES; 329 PARTICIPANTS; VERY LOW CERTAINTY). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: ALMOST ALL OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE INCLUDED STUDIES HAD NASAL POLYPS (99.8%) AND ALL WERE USING TOPICAL NASAL STEROIDS FOR THEIR CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS SYMPTOMS. IN THESE PATIENTS, DUPILUMAB IMPROVES DISEASE-SPECIFIC HRQL COMPARED TO PLACEBO. IT PROBABLY ALSO RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN DISEASE SEVERITY, AND MAY RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS.

CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS IS COMMON. IT IS CHARACTERISED BY INFLAMMATION OF THE NASAL AND SINUS LININGS, NASAL BLOCKAGE, RHINORRHOEA, FACIAL PRESSURE/PAIN AND LOSS OF SENSE OF SMELL. IT OCCURS WITH OR WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS.   'BIOLOGICS' ARE MEDICINAL PRODUCTS PRODUCED BY A BIOLOGICAL PROCESS. MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES ARE ONE TYPE, ALREADY EVALUATED IN RELATED INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS (E.G. ASTHMA AND ATOPIC DERMATITIS). OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF BIOLOGICS FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS. SEARCH METHODS: THE COCHRANE ENT INFORMATION SPECIALIST SEARCHED THE COCHRANE ENT REGISTER; CENTRAL (2019, ISSUE 9); OVID MEDLINE; OVID EMBASE; WEB OF SCIENCE; CLINICALTRIALS.GOV; ICTRP AND ADDITIONAL SOURCES FOR PUBLISHED AND UNPUBLISHED TRIALS. THE DATE OF THE SEARCH WAS 16 SEPTEMBER 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) WITH AT LEAST THREE MONTHS FOLLOW-UP COMPARING BIOLOGICS (CURRENTLY, MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES) AGAINST PLACEBO/NO TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: WE USED STANDARD COCHRANE METHODOLOGICAL PROCEDURES. OUR PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE DISEASE-SPECIFIC HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQL), DISEASE SEVERITY AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAES). THE SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE AVOIDANCE OF SURGERY, EXTENT OF DISEASE (MEASURED BY ENDOSCOPIC OR COMPUTERISED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) SCORE), GENERIC HRQL AND ADVERSE EVENTS (NASOPHARYNGITIS, INCLUDING SORE THROAT). WE USED GRADE TO ASSESS THE CERTAINTY OF THE EVIDENCE FOR EACH OUTCOME. MAIN RESULTS: WE INCLUDED EIGHT RCTS. OF 986 ADULT PARTICIPANTS, 984 HAD SEVERE CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITH NASAL POLYPS; 43% TO 100% OF PARTICIPANTS ALSO HAD ASTHMA. THREE BIOLOGICS, WITH DIFFERENT TARGETS, WERE EVALUATED: DUPILUMAB, MEPOLIZUMAB AND OMALIZUMAB. ALL THE STUDIES WERE SPONSORED OR SUPPORTED BY INDUSTRY. ANTI-IL-4R<U+0391> MAB (DUPILUMAB) VERSUSPLACEBO/NO TREATMENT (ALL RECEIVING INTRANASAL STEROIDS) THREE STUDIES (784 PARTICIPANTS) EVALUATED DUPILUMAB. DISEASE-SPECIFIC HRQL WAS MEASURED WITH THE SNOT-22 (SCORE 0 TO 110; MINIMAL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE (MCID) 8.9 POINTS). AT 24 WEEKS, THE SNOT-22 SCORE WAS 19.61 POINTS LOWER (BETTER) IN PARTICIPANTS RECEIVING DUPILUMAB (MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) -19.61, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) -22.54 TO -16.69; 3 STUDIES; 784 PARTICIPANTS; HIGH CERTAINTY). SYMPTOM SEVERITY MEASURED ON A 0- TO 10-POINT VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) WAS 3.00 LOWER IN THOSE RECEIVING DUPILUMAB (95% CI -3.47 TO -2.53; 3 STUDIES; 784 PARTICIPANTS; MODERATE CERTAINTY). THE RISK OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS MAY BE LOWER IN THE DUPILUMAB GROUP (RISK RATIO (RR) 0.45, 95% CI 0.28 TO 0.75; 3 STUDIES; 782 PARTICIPANTS; LOW CERTAINTY).  THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS REQUIRING NASAL POLYP SURGERY (ACTUAL OR PLANNED) DURING THE TREATMENT PERIOD IS PROBABLY LOWER IN THOSE RECEIVING DUPILUMAB (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.05 TO 0.52; 2 STUDIES; 725 PARTICIPANTS; MODERATE CERTAINTY). CHANGE IN THE EXTENT OF DISEASE USING THE LUND MACKAY COMPUTERISED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) SCORE (0 TO 24, HIGHER = WORSE) WAS -7.00 (95% CI -9.61 TO -4.39; 3 STUDIES; 784 PARTICIPANTS; HIGH CERTAINTY), A LARGE EFFECT FAVOURING THE DUPILUMAB GROUP.  THE EQ-5D VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (0 TO 100, HIGHER = BETTER; MCID 8 POINTS) WAS USED TO MEASURE CHANGE IN GENERIC QUALITY OF LIFE. THE MEAN DIFFERENCE FAVOURING DUPILUMAB WAS 8.59 (95% CI 5.31 TO 11.86; 2 STUDIES; 706 PARTICIPANTS; MODERATE CERTAINTY). THERE MAY BE LITTLE OR NO DIFFERENCE IN THE RISK OF NASOPHARYNGITIS (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.72 TO 1.25; 3 STUDIES; 783 PARTICIPANTS; LOW CERTAINTY). ANTI-IL-5 MAB (MEPOLIZUMAB) VERSUSPLACEBO/NO TREATMENT (ALL RECEIVING INTRANASAL STEROIDS) TWO STUDIES (137 PARTICIPANTS) EVALUATED MEPOLIZUMAB. DISEASE-SPECIFIC HRQL MEASURED WITH THE SNOT-22 AT 25 WEEKS WAS 13.26 POINTS LOWER (BETTER) IN PARTICIPANTS RECEIVING MEPOLIZUMAB (95% CI -22.08 TO -4.44; 1 STUDY; 105 PARTICIPANTS; LOW CERTAINTY; MCID 8.9).  IT IS VERY UNCERTAIN WHETHER THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN S YMPTOM SEVERITY: ON A 0- TO 10-POINT VAS SYMPTOM SEVERITY WAS -2.03 LOWER IN THOSE RECEIVING MEPOLIZUMAB (95% CI -3.65 TO -0.41; 1 STUDY; 72 PARTICIPANTS; VERY LOW CERTAINTY). IT IS VERY UNCERTAIN IF THERE IS DIFFERENCE IN THE RISK OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.07 TO 35.46; 2 STUDIES; 135 PARTICIPANTS, VERY LOW CERTAINTY). IT IS VERY UNCERTAIN WHETHER OR NOT THE OVERALL RISK THAT PATIENTS STILL NEED SURGERY AT TRIAL END IS LOWER IN THE MEPOLIZUMAB GROUP (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64 TO 0.94; 2 STUDIES; 135 PARTICIPANTS; VERY LOW CERTAINTY). IT IS VERY UNCERTAIN WHETHER MEPOLIZUMAB REDUCES THE EXTENT OF DISEASE AS MEASURED BY ENDOSCOPIC NASAL POLYPS SCORE (SCALE RANGE 0 TO 8). THE MEAN DIFFERENCE WAS 1.23 POINTS LOWER IN THE MEPOLIZUMAB GROUP (MD -1.23, 95% -1.79 TO -0.68; 2 STUDIES; 137 PARTICIPANTS; VERY LOW CERTAINTY). THE DIFFERENCE IN GENERIC QUALITY OF LIFE (EQ-5D) WAS 5.68 (95% CI -1.18 TO 12.54; 1 STUDY; 105 PARTICIPANTS; LOW CERTAINTY), FAVOURING THE MEPOLIZUMAB GROUP. THIS DIFFERENCE IS SMALLER THAN THE MCID OF 8 POINTS. THERE MAY BE LITTLE OR NO DIFFERENCE IN THE RISK OF NASOPHARYNGITIS (RR 0.73, 95% 0.36 TO 1.47; 2 STUDIES; 135 PARTICIPANTS; LOW CERTAINTY). ANTI-IGE MAB (OMALIZUMAB) VERSUS PLACEBO/NO TREATMENT (ALL RECEIVING INTRANASAL STEROIDS) THREE VERY SMALL STUDIES (65 PARTICIPANTS) EVALUATED OMALIZUMAB. WE ARE VERY UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE EFFECT OF OMALIZUMAB ON DISEASE-SPECIFIC HRQL, SEVERE ADVERSE EVENTS, EXTENT OF DISEASE (CT SCAN SCORES), GENERIC HRQL AND ADVERSE EFFECTS. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: IN ADULTS WITH SEVERE CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS AND NASAL POLYPS, USING REGULAR TOPICAL NASAL STEROIDS, DUPILUMAB IMPROVES DISEASE-SPECIFIC HRQL COMPARED TO PLACEBO, AND REDUCES THE EXTENT OF THE DISEASE AS MEASURED ON A CT SCAN. IT PROBABLY ALSO IMPROVES SYMPTOMS AND GENERIC HRQL AND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF AN INCREASED RISK OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS. IT MAY REDUCE THE NEED FOR FURTHER SURGERY. THERE MAY BE LITTLE OR NO DIFFERENCE IN THE RISK OF NASOPHARYNGITIS. IN SIMILAR PATIENTS, MEPOLIZUMAB MAY IMPROVE BOTH DISEASE-SPECIFIC AND GENERIC HRQL. IT IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER IT REDUCES THE NEED FOR SURGERY OR IMPROVES NASAL POLYP SCORES. THERE MAY BE LITTLE OR NO DIFFERENCE IN THE RISK OF NASOPHARYNGITIS. IT IS UNCERTAIN IF THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN SYMPTOM SEVERITY AND THE RISK OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS. WE ARE UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF OMALIZUMAB.","UK COCHRANE CENTRE, OXFORD, UK.; FACULTY OF MEDICINE, KHON KAEN UNIVERSITY, DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, KHON KAEN, THAILAND.; NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH AND CARE EXCELLENCE, LEVEL 1A, CITY TOWER, PICCADILLY PLAZA, MANCHESTER, UK, M1 4BT.; CHULALONGKORN UNIVERSITY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, FACULTY OF MEDICINE, BANGKOK, THAILAND.; NORWICH MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA, DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, NORWICH, UK, NR4 7TJ.; GUY'S HOSPITAL, ENT DEPARTMENT, GERAT MAZE POND, LONDON, UK, SE1 9RT.; COCHRANE UK, SUMMERTOWN PAVILION, 18 - 24 MIDDLE WAY, OXFORD, UK, OX2 7LG.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT © 2020 THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION.

THE PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE-9 (PHQ-9), A VALIDATED INSTRUMENT FOR DIAGNOSING DEPRESSION, HAS BEEN USED TO ASSESS DEPRESSION IN A VARIETY OF CLINICAL SETTINGS. PHQ-9 SCORES =10 ARE THE THRESHOLD FOR A DEPRESSION DIAGNOSIS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE PREVALENCE OF DEPRESSION IN A RHINOLOGY PRACTICE AND COMPARE THE PHQ-9 WITH THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). STUDY DESIGN: RETROSPECTIVE CHART REVIEW. SETTING: TERTIARY RHINOLOGY PRACTICE. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: DURING THE 2-MONTH PERIOD ENDING APRIL 30, 2018, ALL RHINOLOGY PATIENTS WERE ASKED TO COMPLETE THE PHQ-9 AND SNOT-22. RESULTS: AMONG 216 PATIENTS, 46 (21.3%) HAD A SELF-REPORTED HISTORY OF DEPRESSION, AND 39 (18.1%) HAD A PHQ-9 SCORE =10. OF THE 39 PATIENTS SCREENING POSITIVE FOR DEPRESSION, 18 (41.9%) HAD NO HISTORY OF DEPRESSION. COMPARISON OF PHQ-9 WITH OVERALL SNOT-22 SCORE HAD A PEARSON'S COEFFICIENT OF 0.632 (P < .005). LOGISTIC REGRESSION SHOWED THAT THE HIGHEST 2 QUINTILES OF SNOT-22 SCORES HAD AN ODDS RATIO OF 60.6 (95% CI, 9.7-378.3) FOR A POSITIVE DEPRESSION SCREEN (PHQ-9 SCORE =10). CONCLUSION: DEPRESSION RATES (ESTIMATED BY PHQ-9 RESPONSES) AMONG RHINOLOGY PATIENTS ARE SIMILAR TO CHRONIC DISEASE POPULATIONS; DEPRESSION MAY BE UNDERDIAGNOSED IN RHINOLOGY PATIENTS. HIGHER SNOT-22 SCORES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER PHQ-9 SCORES.

ALSO, ALLERGIC RHINITIS CAN AFFECT SOCIAL LIFE, SCHOOL PERFORMANCE, AND PRODUCTIVITY, ESPECIALLY IN PATIENTS WITH SEVERE DISEASE. AIM: THE AIM OF THE PRESENT CASE-CONTROL STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF QUALITY-OF-LIFE IMPAIRMENT AND THE MAIN CONTRIBUTING SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS WITH ALLERGIC RHINOSINUSITIS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DURING THE SURVEY FROM JANUARY TO DECEMBER 2018, 139 PARTICIPANTS (111 WITH ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND 28 CONTROLS) WERE ENROLLED IN THE STUDY. PARTICIPANTS IN THE CLINICAL AND CONTROL GROUPS WERE INVITED TO COMPLETE A QUALITY-OF-LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE FOR PATIENTS WITH SINO-NASAL PATHOLOGY (SNOT-22). FOR RESULTS, A COMPARISON IN TERMS OF EYE AFFECTING ITCHING, BURNING, REDNESS, AND TEARING SENSATION, A 10-GRADE VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE TABLE WAS PRESENTED. RESULTS: COMPARING THE CLINICAL AND CONTROL GROUPS OF HEALTHY PATIENTS IN THE FIRST SNOT-22, THE VALUE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATED AS EXPECTED. THE MEAN SCORE (SNOT-22 TOTAL SCORE) OF THE TWENTY-TWO SYMPTOM SCORES IN PATIENTS WAS 2.52±0.93 (0-5); BY COMPARISON, THE VALUE IN THE CONTROL GROUP WAS ONLY 0.64±0.11, WITH THE DIFFERENCE BEING STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P=0.001).

CONCLUSIONS: SUMMARISING THE RESULTS OF OUR STUDY AND THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE, WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT NASAL CONGESTION AND THE ABUNDANCE OF SECRETIONS ARE SYMPTOMS THAT DISRUPT MOSTLY THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN AR PATIENTS AND SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE QUALITY OF SLEEP AND ARE INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCES OF BOTH DAYTIME TONE AND PRODUCTIVITY.THE RICH PALETTE OF SYMPTOMS THAT LEAD TO DETERIORATION OF THE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL WELL-BEING OF THOSE AFFECTED BY AR NECESSITATES THE NEED TO SHARPEN THE ATTENTION OF PROFESSIONALS WORKING FOR THIS TYPE OF PATHOLOGY IN ORDER TO STRIVE TO DETAIL AND DIFFERENTIATE THE SPECIFIC COMPLAINT AND DEGREE OF QUALITY OF LIFE DETERIORATION.","TRAKIA UNIVERSITY, STARA ZAGORA, BULGARIA.;",NA,"THIS IS AN OPEN ACCESS ARTICLE DISTRIBUTED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC BY 4.0), WHICH PERMITS UNRESTRICTED USE, DISTRIBUTION, AND REPRODUCTION IN ANY MEDIUM, PROVIDED THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR AND SOURCE ARE CREDITED.",NA,NA,NA,"2021/07/01 07:32","20220211",NA,2021,"2021/07/02 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,"1314-2143 (ELECTRONIC) 0204-8043 (LINKING)","2984761R","FOLIA MEDICA","ENG","10.3897/FOLMED.63.E55256 [DOI]","20220211","2022/02/12 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","337-347","BULGARIA",NA,NA,"34196149","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"FOLIA MED (PLOVDIV). 2021 JUN 30;63(3):337-347.

OUR OBJECTIVES WERE TO USE AN UNBIASED SYMPTOM-BASED APPROACH TO: (1) STUDY SYMPTOMS, CLINICAL AND ENDOTYPIC FEATURES; AND (2) IDENTIFY FEATURES PREDICATING OUTCOMES FROM ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS). METHODS: CLINICAL, COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT), HISTOPATHOLOGY, AND 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) DATA WAS COLLECTED ON 146 ADULT CRSSNP PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT ESS. UNSUPERVISED NETWORK MODELING OF PRESURGICAL SNOT-22 SCORES WAS PERFORMED TO CLASSIFY SYMPTOM-BASED CLUSTERS. SUBJECT CHARACTERISTICS AND POST-ESS SNOT-22 SCORES WERE COMPARED BETWEEN CLUSTERS. RESULTS: BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SUBJECT POPULATION WERE AS FOLLOWS: FEMALES, 56.2%; REVISION ESS STATUS IN 35%; ASTHMA PREVALENCE, 32.6%; MEDIAN LUND-MACKAY CT SCORE, 8; AND MEDIAN SNOT-22 TOTAL SCORE, 43. NETWORK MAPPING AND UNSUPERVISED CLUSTERING OF PREOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORES REVEALED 4 CLUSTERS: (A) SEVERELY BURDENED WITH HIGH SCORES IN ALL 4 SUBDOMAINS; (B) MODERATELY BURDENED WITH HIGH SCORES IN THE RHINOLOGIC SUBDOMAIN; (C) MODERATELY BURDENED WITH HIGH SCORES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL-SLEEP SUBDOMAINS; AND (D) MILDLY BURDENED. THE NUMBER OF PREVIOUS ESS AND ASTHMA PREVALENCE DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN CLUSTERS; CT SCORES WERE SIMILAR. ASTHMA BURDEN AND TISSUE EOSINOPHILIA WERE GREATEST IN CLUSTER A (P = 0.03).

THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO EVALUATE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF DUPILUMAB VERSUS ESS FOR PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP. STUDY DESIGN: COHORT-STYLE MARKOV DECISION-TREE ECONOMIC MODEL WITH A 36-YEAR TIME HORIZON. METHODS: A COHORT OF 197 CRSWNP PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT ESS WERE COMPARED WITH A MATCHED COHORT OF 293 CRSWNP PATIENTS FROM THE SINUS-24 AND SINUS-52 PHASE 3 STUDIES WHO UNDERWENT TREATMENT WITH DUPILUMAB 300 MG EVERY 2 WEEKS. UTILITY SCORES WERE CALCULATED FROM THE SNOT-22 INSTRUMENT IN BOTH COHORTS. DECISION-TREE ANALYSIS AND A 10-STATE MARKOV MODEL UTILIZED PUBLISHED EVENT PROBABILITIES AND PRIMARY DATA TO CALCULATE LONG-TERM COSTS AND UTILITY. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS INCREMENTAL COST PER QUALITY-ADJUSTED LIFE YEAR (QALY), WHICH IS EXPRESSED AS AN INCREMENTAL COST EFFECTIVENESS RATIO. ONE-WAY AND PROBABILISTIC SENSITIVITY ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED. RESULTS: THE ESS STRATEGY COST $50,436.99 AND PRODUCED 9.80 QALYS. THE DUPILUMAB TREATMENT STRATEGY COST $536,420.22 AND PRODUCED 8.95 QALYS. BECAUSE DUPILUMAB TREATMENT WAS MORE COSTLY AND LESS EFFECTIVE THAN THE ESS STRATEGY, IT IS DOMINATED BY ESS IN THE BASE CASE. ONE-WAY SENSITIVITY ANALYSES SHOWED ESS TO BE COST-EFFECTIVE VERSUS DUPILUMAB REGARDLESS OF THE FREQUENCY OF REVISION SURGERY AND AT ANY YEARLY COST OF DUPILUMAB ABOVE $855. CONCLUSIONS: THE ESS TREATMENT STRATEGY IS MORE COST EFFECTIVE THAN DUPILUMAB FOR UPFRONT TREATMENT OF CRSWNP. MORE STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO ISOLATE POTENTIAL PHENOTYPES OR ENDOTYPES THAT WILL BENEFIT MOST FROM DUPILUMAB IN A COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: THE NATIONAL COMPARATIVE AUDIT OF SURGERY FOR NASAL POLYPOSIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WAS A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY COLLECTING DATA ON 3128 ADULT PATIENTS UNDERGOING SINONASAL SURGERY IN 87 NHS HOSPITALS IN ENGLAND AND WALES. DATA WERE COLLECTED PREOPERATIVELY AND AT 3 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY, AND ANALYSED TO DETERMINE VALIDITY OF THE SNOT-22. TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY WAS ASSESSED IN A SEPARATE COHORT OF PATIENTS IN A SINGLE CENTRE. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: THE SNOT-22, A DERIVATIVE OF THE SNOT-20 WAS THE MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE. PATIENTS WERE ALSO ASKED TO REPORT WHETHER THEY FELT BETTER, THE SAME OR WORSE FOLLOWING SURGERY. TO EVALUATE THE SNOT-22, THE INTERNAL CONSISTENCY, RESPONSIVENESS, KNOWN GROUP DIFFERENCES AND VALIDITY WERE ANALYSED. RESULTS: PREOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORES WERE COMPLETED BY 2803 PATIENTS. 3-MONTH POSTOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORES WERE AVAILABLE FOR 2284 PATIENTS OF ALL PATIENTS WHO COMPLETED A PREOPERATIVE FORM (81.5% RESPONSE RATE). THE CRONBACH'S ALPHA SCORES FOR THE SNOT-22 WERE 0.91 INDICATING HIGH INTERNAL CONSISTENCY. THE TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY COEFFICIENT WAS 0.93, INDICATING HIGH RELIABILITY OF REPEATED MEASURES. THE SNOT-22 WAS ABLE TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN PATIENTS KNOWN TO SUFFER WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS AND A GROUP OF HEALTHY CONTROLS (P < 0.0001, T = 85.3). IT WAS ALSO ABLE TO IDENTIFY STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN SUB-GROUPS OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS. THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.0001, T = 39.94) DECREASE IN PATIENT REPORTED SNOT-22 SCORES AT 3 MONTHS. AT 3 MONTHS THE OVERALL EFFECT SIZE IN ALL PATIENTS WAS 0.81, WHICH IS CONSIDERED LARGE. WE FOUND THE MINIMALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE THAT IS THE SMALLEST CHANGE IN SNOT-22 SCORE THAT CAN BE DETECTED BY A PATIENT, TO BE 8.9 POINTS. CONCLUSIONS: WE HAVE FOUND THE SNOT-22 TO BE VALID AND EASY TO USE. IT CAN BE USED TO FACILITATE ROUTINE CLINICAL PRACTICE TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPACT OF CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS ON THE PATIENT'S QUALITY OF LIFE, AND MAY ALSO BE USED TO MEASURE THE OUTCOME OF SURGICAL INTERVENTION. THE MINIMALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE ALLOWS US TO INTERPRET SCORES IN A CLINICAL CONTEXT, AND MAY HELP TO IMPROVE PATIENT SELECTION FOR SURGERY.","GUY' AND ST THOMAS' NHS FOUNDATION TRUST, LONDON, UK.; CLAIREHOPKINS@YAHOO.;COM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2009/10/02 06:00","20100127",NA,2009,"2009/10/02 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"5",NA,"1749-4486 (ELECTRONIC) 1749-4478 (LINKING)","101247023","CLINICAL OTOLARYNGOLOGY : OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF ENT-UK ; OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF NETHERLANDS SOCIETY FOR OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY & CERVICO-FACIAL SURGERY","ENG","10.1111/J.1749-4486.2009.01995.X [DOI]","20191210","2010/01/28 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","447-54","ENGLAND",NA,NA,"19793277","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"CLIN OTOLARYNGOL. 2009 OCT;34(5):447-54.

HOWEVER, RECURRENCE POSTSURGERY IS COMMON. DUPILUMAB, A FULLY HUMAN MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY, BLOCKS THE SHARED RECEPTOR FOR INTERLEUKIN 4 (IL-4) AND IL-13, KEY AND CENTRAL DRIVERS OF TYPE 2 INFLAMMATION. WE REPORT THE EFFICACY OF DUPILUMAB IN PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP FROM THE SINUS-24/SINUS-52 TRIALS (NCT02912468/NCT02898454), BY NUMBER OF PRIOR SURGERIES AND TIME SINCE LAST SURGERY. METHODS: PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO PLACEBO OR DUPILUMAB 300 MG EVERY 2 WEEKS. POST HOC SUBGROUP ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED FOR PATIENTS WITH 0, =1, 1/2, OR =3 PRIOR SURGERIES, AND FOR PATIENTS WHO HAD SURGERY WITHIN <3, 3 TO <5, 5 TO <10, OR =10 YEARS. EFFICACY OUTCOMES AT 24 WEEKS INCLUDED CO-PRIMARY ENDPOINTS NASAL POLYP SCORE (NPS) AND NASAL CONGESTION (NC), AND LUND-MACKAY (LMK), 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), AND SMELL SCORES. RESULTS: OF 724 PATIENTS RANDOMIZED, 459 (63.4%) HAD =1 PRIOR SURGERY. BASELINE SINUS DISEASE (NPS, NC, LMK) AND OLFACTORY DYSFUNCTION (UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA SMELL IDENTIFICATION TEST [UPSIT] AND LOSS OF SMELL) SCORES WERE WORSE FOR PATIENTS WITH =3 PRIOR SURGERIES VS NO SURGERY. BASELINE NPS AND LMK WERE WORSE IN PATIENTS WITH <3 YEARS SINCE LAST SURGERY THAN IN PATIENTS WITH =5 YEARS SINCE LAST SURGERY. DUPILUMAB SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED ALL OUTCOME MEASURES VS PLACEBO IN ALL SUBGROUPS BY NUMBER OF SURGERIES AND BY TIME SINCE LAST SURGERY. IMPROVEMENTS IN NPS AND LMK WERE GREATER IN PATIENTS WITH <3 YEARS SINCE LAST SURGERY THAN PATIENTS WITH =5 YEARS. SAFETY RESULTS WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE KNOWN DUPILUMAB SAFETY PROFILE.

METHOD: THE BRAZILIAN VERSION OF THE SNOT-22 WAS DEVELOPED ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL GUIDELINES AND WAS BROKEN DOWN INTO NINE STAGES: 1) PREPARATION 2) TRANSLATION 3) RECONCILIATION 4) BACK-TRANSLATION 5) COMPARISON 6) EVALUATION BY THE AUTHOR OF THE SNOT-22 7) REVISION BY COMMITTEE OF EXPERTS 8) COGNITIVE DEBRIEFING 9) FINAL VERSION. SECOND PHASE: PROSPECTIVE STUDY CONSISTING OF A VERIFICATION OF THE PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES, BY ANALYZING INTERNAL CONSISTENCY AND TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY. RESULTS: CULTURAL ADAPTATION SHOWED ADEQUATE UNDERSTANDING, ACCEPTABILITY AND PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES. CONCLUSION: WE FOLLOWED THE RECOMMENDED STEPS FOR THE CULTURAL ADAPTATION OF THE SNOT-22 INTO PORTUGUESE LANGUAGE, PRODUCING A TOOL FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF PATIENTS WITH SINONASAL DISORDERS OF CLINICAL IMPORTANCE AND FOR SCIENTIFIC STUDIES.","MEDICAL SCIENCES, FEDERAL UNIVERSITY OF RIO GRANDE DO SUL.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2013/01/12 06:00","20130624",NA,2012,"2013/01/12 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"6",NA,"1808-8686 (ELECTRONIC) 1808-8686 (LINKING)","101207337","BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY","ENG",NA,"20191210","2013/06/26 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","34-9","BRAZIL",NA,NA,"23306565","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"BRAZ J OTORHINOLARYNGOL. 2012 DEC;78(6):34-9.

AS SURVIVAL RATES HAVE IMPROVED, IT HAS BECOME IMPERATIVE THAT OTOLARYNGOLOGISTS BECOME INVOLVED IN THE CARE OF PATIENTS WITH CF TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE MEDICAL AND SURGICAL INTERVENTIONS FOR SINONASAL DISEASE. DESPITE SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY IN THE SUBJECTIVE REPORTING OF CLINICAL SYMPTOMS, PREVIOUS WORK HAS SUGGESTED THERE MAY BE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CLINICAL INDICATORS AND SINONASAL DISEASE IN THIS POPULATION. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA SMELL IDENTIFICATION TEST (UPSIT), AND OTHER MEASURES OF SINONASAL DISEASE COULD BE USED TO PREDICT THE PRESENCE OF SUBCLINICAL NASAL POLYPS IN CHILDREN WITH CF. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: THIS WAS A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY PERFORMED FROM MAY 2012 THROUGH APRIL 2013 AT A CYSTIC FIBROSIS CLINIC AT BC CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA. THERE WERE 72 ELIGIBLE CHILDREN WITH CF FOR THIS STUDY (WITH A CONFIRMED DIAGNOSIS OF CF BASED ON GENETIC TESTING; THEIR AGES RANGED FROM 6 TO 18 YEARS, AND THEY WERE NOT ACTIVELY BEING TREATED BY AN OTOLARYNGOLOGIST). THIRTY-SEVEN OF THESE PATIENTS (23 MALES, 14 FEMALES) CONSENTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS STUDY. TWENTY-THREE DECLINED PARTICIPATION, AND 12 COULD NOT BE CONTACTED. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: POTENTIAL CLINICAL PREDICTORS FOR THE PRESENCE OF SUBCLINICAL NASAL POLYPS WERE DETERMINED A PRIORI. ALL 37 RECRUITED PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A FULL STUDY ASSESSMENT. NASAL ENDOSCOPY (THE GOLD STANDARD) WAS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE PRESENCE OF NASAL POLYPS. POTENTIAL PREDICTORS THAT WERE ASSESSED INCLUDED AGE, SEX, GENOTYPE, PANCREATIC FUNCTION, SNOT-22 AND UPSIT SCORES, ORAL CULTURE SWAB RESULT, AND SEVERITY OF FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 SECOND (FEV(1)). RESULTS: A SNOT-22 SCORE OF GREATER THAN 11 WAS THE ONLY STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF NASAL POLYPS (P = .04). THE POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE WAS 68.1%, THE NEGATIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE WAS 66.7%, AND THE POSITIVE LIKELIHOOD RATIO WAS 1.82. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: GIVEN THAT THE SNOT-22 IS EASY TO ADMINISTER AND INEXPENSIVE, THIS SINUS DISEASE-SPECIFIC QUESTIONNAIRE SEEMS TO BE AN APPROPRIATE TOOL FOR ROUTINE USE BY RESPIROLOGISTS WHEN ASSESSING PATIENTS WITH CF TO HELP PREDICT SUBCLINICAL NASAL POLYPS.","DIVISION OF PEDIATRIC OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, BC CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA.; DIVISION OF PEDIATRIC OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, BC CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA.; DIVISION OF PEDIATRIC OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, BC CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA.; DIVISION OF PEDIATRIC OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, BC CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA.; DIVISION OF RESPIROLOGY, BC CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA.; DIVISION OF PEDIATRIC OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, BC CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2014/08/22 06:00","20150209",NA,2014,"2014/08/22 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"10",NA,"2168-619X (ELECTRONIC) 2168-6181 (LINKING)","101589542","JAMA OTOLARYNGOLOGY-- HEAD & NECK SURGERY","ENG","10.1001/JAMAOTO.2014.1650 [DOI]","20141017","2015/02/11 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","934-9","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"25144751","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"JAMA OTOLARYNGOL HEAD NECK SURG. 2014 OCT;140(10):934-9.

SLEEP DISRUPTION IN CRS CAUSES DECREASED QOL AND IS LINKED TO POOR FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES SUCH AS IMPAIRED COGNITIVE FUNCTION AND DEPRESSION. AREAS COVERED: A SYSTEMATIC PUBMED/MEDLINE SEARCH WAS DONE TO ASSESS THE RESULTS OF STUDIES THAT HAVE INVESTIGATED SLEEP AND SLEEP DISTURBANCES IN CRS. EXPERT COMMENTARY: THESE STUDIES REPORTED SLEEP DISRUPTION IN MOST CRS PATIENTS. THE MAIN RISK FACTORS FOR SLEEP DISRUPTION IN CRS INCLUDE ALLERGIC RHINITIS, SMOKING, AND HIGH SNOT-22 TOTAL SCORES. THE LITERATURE IS INCONSISTENT WITH REGARD TO THE PREVALENCE OF SLEEP-RELATED DISORDERED BREATHING (E.G. OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA) IN CRS PATIENTS. ALTHOUGH NASAL OBSTRUCTION IS LINKED TO SLEEP DISRUPTION, THE EXTENT OF SLEEP DISRUPTION IN CRS SEEMS TO EXPAND BEYOND THAT EXPECTED FROM PHYSICAL BLOCKAGE OF THE UPPER AIRWAYS ALONE.

STUDY DESIGN: BLINDED, PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. METHODS: CRS PATIENTS COMPLETED TWO PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME MEASURES (PROMS)-THE VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) SYMPTOM SCORE AND THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22)-AND THEN UNDERWENT A STANDARDIZED, RECORDED SINONASAL ENDOSCOPY. VIDEOS WERE SCORED BY THREE BLINDED RHINOLOGISTS USING THREE SCORING SYSTEMS: THE LUND-KENNEDY (LK) ENDOSCOPIC SCORE; THE DISCHARGE, INFLAMMATION, POLYP (DIP) SCORE; AND THE PERIOPERATIVE SINONASAL ENDOSCOPIC SCORE. THE VIDEOS WERE FURTHER SCORED USING A MODIFIED LUND-KENNEDY (MLK) ENDOSCOPIC SCORING SYSTEM, WHICH RETAINS THE LK SUBSCORES OF POLYPS, EDEMA, AND DISCHARGE BUT ELIMINATES THE SCORING OF SCARRING AND CRUSTING. THE SYSTEMS WERE COMPARED FOR TEST-RETEST AND INTER-RATER RELIABILITY AS WELL AS FOR THEIR CORRELATION WITH PROMS. RESULTS: ONE HUNDRED TWO CRS PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED. THE MLK SYSTEM SHOWED THE HIGHEST INTER-RATER AND TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY OF ALL SCORING SYSTEMS. ALL SYSTEMS EXCEPT FOR THE DIP CORRELATED WITH TOTAL VAS SCORES. THE MLK WAS THE ONLY SYSTEM THAT CORRELATED WITH THE SYMPTOM SUBSCORE OF THE SNOT-22 IN BOTH UNOPERATED AND POSTOPERATIVE PATIENTS. CONCLUSIONS: MODIFICATION OF THE LK SYSTEM BY EXCLUDING THE SUBSCORES OF SCARRING AND CRUSTING IMPROVES ITS RELIABILITY AND ITS CORRELATION WITH PROMS. IN ADDITION, THE MLK SYSTEM RETAINS THE FAMILIARITY OF THE WIDELY USED LK SYSTEM AND IS APPLICABLE TO ANY PATIENT IRRESPECTIVE OF SURGICAL STATUS. THE MLK SYSTEM MAY BE A MORE SUITABLE AND RELIABLE ENDOSCOPIC SCORING SYSTEM FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE AND OUTCOMES RESEARCH.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE, ADELAIDE, SOUTH AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIA.;",NA,"© 2014 THE AMERICAN LARYNGOLOGICAL, RHINOLOGICAL AND OTOLOGICAL SOCIETY, INC.",NA,NA,NA,"2014/03/12 06:00","20141203","20140402",2014,"2014/03/13 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"10",NA,"1531-4995 (ELECTRONIC) 0023-852X (LINKING)","8607378","THE LARYNGOSCOPE","ENG","10.1002/LARY.24654 [DOI]","20140929","2014/12/15 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","2216-23","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"24615873","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"LARYNGOSCOPE. 2014 OCT;124(10):2216-23.

THE TRANSLATION INTO GREEK HAS BEEN CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL FOR THE INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT OF THE PATIENTS' SYMPTOMS AND A RELIABLE TOOL FOR QUALITY OF LIFE EVALUATION. METHODS: OUR STUDY INCLUDED 40 PATIENTS WITH CRS WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS AND 40 HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS AS CONTROL GROUP RECRUITED FROM THE ENT ALLERGY AND ENDOSCOPY CLINIC OF CHANIA GENERAL HOSPITAL. ASSESSMENT INCLUDED FULL ENT EXAMINATION AND NASAL ENDOSCOPY. IN THE STUDY, WE COMPARED THE PATIENTS' EXAMINATION AND REEXAMINATION RESULTS WITH THE RESULTS OF THE CONTROL GROUP, AND THUS ESTIMATED TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY, INTERNAL CONSISTENCY (DETERMINED BY CRONBACH'S ALPHA) AND VALIDITY. RESULTS: THE STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL CALCULATED BY THE PAIRED T TEST WAS P < 0.05 FOR ALL QUESTIONS, WHICH PROVES THE QUESTIONNAIRE'S CONSISTENCY. THE KAPPA VALUE WAS ESTIMATED FOR EACH SYMPTOM, WITH AN AVERAGE VALUE OF 0.94. CRONBACH'S ALPHA WAS 0.934 IN THE TEST AND 0.856 IN THE RETEST.

ADVANCES IN NEW THERAPIES AS WELL AS EVIDENCE REGARDING INDICATION AND TIMING OF SURGERY, ESPECIALLY OF MORE COMPLEX CASES, ARE HIGHLIGHTED. RECENT FINDINGS: NEW STUDIES HAVE ENDOTYPED PATIENTS IN AN EFFORT TO DESCRIBE THE EXACT INFLAMMATORY PROFILE OF EACH PHENOTYPE, WHEREAS DESCRIBED CYTOKINES SEEM TO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN AMPLIFICATION OF T2 INFLAMMATION, DIRECTLY OR VIA INNATE LYMPHOID CELLS.

RECENT FINDINGS: BIOLOGICS THAT TARGET THE IL-4 RECEPTOR (DUPILUMAB), IGE (OMALIZUMAB), AND IL-5 (MEPOLIZUMAB, RESLIZUMAB, AND BENRALIZUMAB) IN PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP HAVE SHOWN IMPROVEMENT OF VARIOUS METRICS INCLUDING SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES, NASAL POLYP SCORES (NPS), NASAL CONGESTION SCORES (NCS), AND LUND-MACKAY SINUS OPACIFICATION SCORES.

METHODS: A LITERATURE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY STUDIES THAT ASSESSED SNOT-22 SCORES BEFORE AND AFTER ESS IN ADULT PATIENTS WITH CRS. A RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL WITH INVERSE VARIANCE WEIGHTING WAS USED TO GENERATE THE MEAN CHANGE AFTER SURGERY, ALONG WITH THE FOREST PLOT AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI). THE IMPACT OF PATIENT-SPECIFIC FACTORS ACROSS STUDIES WAS ASSESSED USING A MIXED-EFFECTS META-REGRESSION. RESULTS: THE FINAL STUDY LIST INCLUDED 40 UNIQUE PATIENT COHORTS PUBLISHED FROM 2008 TO 2016. ALL STUDIES SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN MEAN SNOT-22 SCORES BETWEEN BASELINE AND POSTOPERATIVE TIME POINTS (P < .001), RANGING FROM 12.7 TO 44.8, AT AN AVERAGE FOLLOW-UP OF 10.6 MONTHS. THE SUMMARY CHANGE IN MEAN SNOT-22 ACROSS ALL STUDIES WAS 24.4 (95% CI: 22.0-26.8). AFTER FORWARD, STEP-WISE MULTIVARIATE MODELING, STUDIES WITH HIGHER MEAN PREOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORE AND HIGHER ASTHMA PREVALENCE WERE ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER CHANGES IN SNOT-22 SCORE AFTER ESS, WHEREAS STUDIES WITH LONGER MEAN FOLLOW-UP HAD SMALLER CHANGES IN SNOT-22 SCORE. CONCLUSIONS: STUDIES EVALUATING QUALITY-OF-LIFE OUTCOMES AFTER SINUS SURGERY USING THE SNOT-22 INSTRUMENT UNIVERSALLY SHOW SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT AFTER ESS. ACROSS THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE, THE MAGNITUDE OF CHANGE IS QUITE VARIABLE AND APPEARS TO BE INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING BASELINE SNOT-22 SCORE, ASTHMA PREVALENCE, AND LENGTH OF FOLLOW-UP.

OBJECTIVE: TO ANALYZE WHETHER ACTIVE SMOKING WAS A RISK FACTOR FOR CRS DEVELOPMENT, SMOKING WAS ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE-SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE, AND SMOKERS EXPERIENCE AN INCREASED SYMPTOM BURDEN THAN NONSMOKERS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: THIS SUBANALYSIS OF THE CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS EPIDEMIOLOGY STUDY (CRES), A PROSPECTIVE, QUESTIONNAIRE-BASED CASE-CONTROL STUDY CONDUCTED BETWEEN OCTOBER 2007 AND SEPTEMBER 2013 WAS CONDUCTED ACROSS 30 UK TERTIARY/SECONDARY CARE SITES. PARTICIPANTS WERE IDENTIFIED AT EAR, NOSE, AND THROAT OUTPATIENT CLINICS AND CLASSIFIED INTO CRS PHENOTYPES AS PER EUROPEAN POSITION PAPER ON RHINOSINUSITIS AND NASAL POLYPS 2012 CRITERIA. THE OVERALL RESPONSE RATE OF THOSE IDENTIFIED TO TAKE PART IN THE STUDY WAS 66%. A TOTAL OF 1535 QUESTIONNAIRES WERE RETURNED, WITH 1470 CONSIDERED ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION. DATA ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED IN JANUARY 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: THE CRES WAS DESIGNED TO DISTINGUISH DIFFERENCES IN SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, GEOGRAPHY, MEDICAL COMORBIDITIES, LIFESTYLE, AND QUALITY OF LIFE BETWEEN PATIENTS WITH CRS AND HEALTHY CONTROLS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 1450 PATIENTS COMPLETED THE SMOKING QUESTION, COMPRISING 219 CONTROLS (15.1%; MEAN [SD] AGE, 47.3 [14.9] YEARS; 143 WOMEN [68%]), 546 PARTICIPANTS WITH CRS (37.7%; MEAN [SD] AGE, 51.8 [15.3] YEARS; 259 WOMEN [53%]) WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS (CRSSNPS), AND 685 PARTICIPANTS (47.2%; MEAN [SD] AGE, 56.0 [14.5] YEARS; 204 WOMEN [33%]) WITH CRS AND NASAL POLYPS/ALLERGIC FUNGAL RHINOSINUSITIS (CRSWNPS+). THE MEAN AGE WAS SIMILAR, WITH A GREATER FEMALE PREPONDERANCE IN THE CONTROL GROUP AND MALE IN THE CRSWNP GROUP. THE GREATEST NUMBER OF ACTIVE SMOKERS WAS FOUND AMONG CONTROL PARTICIPANTS (33 [15%]), WITH A LOWER RATE OF SMOKERS IN THE PATIENTS WITH CRSWNPS+ (9.9%) AND CRSSNPS (13.9%), RESPECTIVELY.

IN BOTH CRS SUBGROUPS ACTIVE SMOKERS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE SNOT-22 SCORES THAN NONSMOKERS BY A MEAN (SD) MAGNITUDE OF 10 (18.99, 24.14) POINTS. NONSMOKERS ALSO DEMONSTRATED A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF SURGICAL PROCEDURES (1 OR MORE), ALTHOUGH THIS WAS NOT CLINICALLY OR STATISTICALLY DIFFERENT (0.34, 1.10).

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF BIOLOGIC THERAPY FOR ASTHMA ON CO-EXISTENT CRS IN THE \"REAL-WORLD\" SETTING. METHODS: A REVIEW OF ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (2016-2019) AT MAYO CLINIC WAS CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY ASTHMA PATIENTS TREATED WITH BIOLOGICS WHO HAD CO-EXISTENT CRS. MATCHED-PAIR ANALYSES COMPARED PRETHERAPY AND POSTTHERAPY LUND-MACKAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) SCORES AND 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES. PERFORMANCE OF ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS) AFTER INITIATING BIOLOGICS WAS STUDIED. RESULTS: WE IDENTIFIED 247 PATIENTS WHO RECEIVED ANTI-ASTHMA BIOLOGIC THERAPY AND HAD CO-EXISTENT CRS. OF THESE, 181 PATIENTS (73.3%) HAD CRS WITH NASAL POLYPOSIS (CRSWNP) AND 66 (26.7%) HAD CRS WITHOUT NASAL POLYPOSIS (CRSSNP). THE BIOLOGICS UTILIZED WERE OMALIZUMAB (51.0%), MEPOLIZUMAB (46.6%), BENRALIZUMAB (10.5%), RESLIZUMAB (1.6%), AND DUPILUMAB (2.4%). ANTI-INTERLEUKIN-5 (ANTI-IL-5) INTERVENTION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN CT SCORES (CRS OVERALL, CRSWNP SUBGROUP, CRSSNP SUBGROUP) AND SNOT-22 SCORES (CRS OVERALL, CRSWNP SUBGROUP). PATIENTS ON OMALIZUMAB HAD A DECREASE IN CT SCORES, BUT NOT SNOT-22 SCORES. ESS WAS PERFORMED IN 206 PATIENTS (84.1%); 55 (22.3%) UNDERWENT SURGERY POST-BIOLOGIC INTERVENTION (ANTI-IL-5: 16.5%; OMALIZUMAB 27.8% OF PATIENTS). CONCLUSION: ANTI-IL-5 AGENTS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED CT AND SNOT-22 SCORES IN THE OVERALL CRS GROUP AND IN CRSWNP SUBGROUP; CRSSNP PATIENTS SHOWED IMPROVED CT SCORES ONLY. OMALIZUMAB IMPROVED CT BUT NOT SNOT-22 SCORES. ESS WAS PERFORMED IN 22% OF PATIENTS AFTER INITIATING BIOLOGICS.

METHODS: PATIENTS UNDERGOING ESS BETWEEN NOVEMBER 2016 AND AUGUST 2017 WERE REVIEWED RETROSPECTIVELY. THE MEDICAL AND CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE UTILIZATION REVIEW AND EVALUATION SYSTEM (CURES) RECORDS WERE REVIEWED; PATIENTS REQUIRING AOP WITHIN 60 DAYS AFTER SURGERY WERE IDENTIFIED. THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES OF INTEREST WERE THE ASSOCIATION OF BASELINE AND FIRST POSTOPERATIVE VISIT SNOT-22 TOTAL AND DOMAIN SCORES WITH AOP. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 121 PATIENTS WERE REVIEWED, 22 (18.2%) REQUIRED AOP. BASELINE SNOT-22 SCORES WERE HIGHER IN AGGREGATE (58.7 ± 16.0 VS 46.1 ± 22.5) AND EAR/FACIAL DOMAIN (11.4 ± 4.8 VS 8.5 ± 5.4) IN THE AOP GROUP (P < 0.01). AOP PATIENTS ALSO DEMONSTRATED HIGHER SCORES ACROSS ALL SNOT-22 DOMAINS (P < 0.001) AT THE IMMEDIATE PREOPERATIVE VISIT. THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE ABSOLUTE IMPROVEMENT BETWEEN GROUPS (15.5 ± 18.30 VS 12.3 ± 23.9, P = 0.54). AOP PATIENTS EXPERIENCED LESS RELATIVE IMPROVEMENT (20.2% VS 34.8%, P < 0.05) AND SMALLER MEAN EFFECT SIZE (0.57 VS 0.70, P < 0.001) AFTER ESS. CONCLUSION: PATIENTS REPORTING INCREASED EAR AND FACIAL SYMPTOMS AT BASELINE HAVE AN INCREASED RISK OF ADDITIONAL OPIATE PRESCRIPTION AFTER SURGERY; PREOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORES MAY PROVIDE UTILITY IN IDENTIFYING THESE PATIENTS.

PREOPERATIVE, POSTOPERATIVE/PRE-AD, AND POSTOPERATIVE/POST-AD SINONASAL SYMPTOM SCORES WERE COLLECTED (22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOMES TEST, SNOT-22). A LONGITUDINAL LINEAR MIXED-EFFECTS MODEL WAS USED FOR DATA ANALYSIS. RESULTS: FORTY-SEVEN PATIENTS (59.6% FEMALE) AGED 48.0 ± 13.2 WERE INCLUDED. AVERAGE TIME FROM SURGERY TO AD WAS 70.0 ± 52.8 DAYS. PREOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORES (N = 47) WERE DIVIDED INTO TERTILES (CUTOFFS OF 36 AND 54 INDICATING MILD [22.5 ± 13.7], MODERATE [44.3 ± 12.2], AND SEVERE [72.9 ± 19.7] DISEASE).

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: BASELINE SNOT-22, SF-12 AND EQ-5D-5L SCORES. RESULTS: FIFTY-TWO ADULTS WERE RECRUITED WITH A MEAN AGE OF 55 YEARS, 51% WERE MALE. THE MEAN SNOT-22 SCORE WAS 43.82. MENTAL AND PHYSICAL COMPONENT SCORES OF THE SF-12 WERE 46.53 AND 46, RESPECTIVELY. MEAN INDEX SCORE COMPUTED FORM THE EQ-5D-5L WAS 0.75. WORSE (HIGHER) SNOT-22 SCORES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER EQ-5D-5L VAS AND UTILITY SCORES AND SF-12 MCS AND PCS SCORES. CONCLUSION: THE EQ-5D-5L SUGGESTS THAT BRITISH CRSSNPS PATIENTS ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED WITH REGARDS TO QUALITY OF LIFE. WE FOUND THE SF-12 TO BE LESS SENSITIVE AND CONCLUDE THAT THE EQ-5D-5L TOOL IS A QUICK AND ACCESSIBLE METHOD FOR ASSESSING QOL IN ORDER IT CAN BE COMPARED WITH OTHER DISEASE STATES.","JAMES PAGET UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, GORLESTON, UK.; UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON, LONDON, UK.; GUYS & ST THOMAS' HOSPITAL, LONDON, UK.; NORWICH MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA, NORWICH, UK.; JAMES PAGET UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, GORLESTON, UK.; NORWICH MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA, NORWICH, UK.;","ORCID: 0000-0001-5424-3129 ORCID: 0000-0002-1125-3236","© 2017 JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD.",NA,NA,NA,"2017/05/13 06:00","20180926","20170613",2018,"2017/05/13 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"1",NA,"1749-4486 (ELECTRONIC) 1749-4478 (LINKING)","101247023","CLINICAL OTOLARYNGOLOGY : OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF ENT-UK ; OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF NETHERLANDS SOCIETY FOR OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY & CERVICO-FACIAL SURGERY","ENG","10.1111/COA.12903 [DOI]","20180926","2018/09/27 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","90-95","ENGLAND",NA,NA,"28498517","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"CLIN OTOLARYNGOL. 2018 FEB;43(1):90-95.

THE IMPORTANCE OF DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND, SUCH AS AGE, AS INDEPENDENT VARIABLES HAS NOT BEEN ELUCIDATED WHILE TAKING THESE FACTORS INTO ACCOUNT. STUDY DESIGN: RESPECTIVE REVIEW. METHODS: CRS PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT PRIMARY SURGICAL TREATMENT WERE SUBDIVIDED BASED ON AGE (YOUNG ADULTS = AGE 18-39, ADULTS = AGE 40-64, AND ELDERLY = AGE 65+). GROUPS WERE THEN SUBDIVIDED BASED ON TISSUE EOSINOPHILIA AND NASAL POLYPOSIS. SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), LUND-KENNEDY (LK) ENDOSCOPY SCORES, AND LUND-MCKAY (LM) CT SCORES WERE COMPARED PREOPERATIVELY, AND POSTOPERATIVELY DURING A 5-YEAR PERIOD. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 431 CRS PATIENTS IDENTIFIED AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY BROKEN DOWN INTO 63 YOUNG ADULTS (YA), 209 ADULTS (A), AND 159 ELDERLY (E). THERE WAS NO STATISTICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TISSUE EOSINOPHILIA AND PRESENCE OF POLYPS BETWEEN THE GROUPS. ALL THREE GROUPS HAD SIMILAR SHORT- AND LONG-TERM SNOT-22 PATTERNS POSTOPERATIVELY. AT PRESENTATION, YOUNG ADULTS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SNOT-22 SCORE (33.2 YA, 25.3 A, 23.5 E, P = .029) AND SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RHINOLOGIC SCORES (1.9 YA, 1.3 A, 1.3 E, P = .0012) THAN THE ADULT AND ELDERLY PATIENTS. OBJECTIVE DISEASE SEVERITY USING LK ENDOSCOPY SCORES WERE ONLY SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN YOUNG ADULTS AT 1-YEAR TIME (P = .0026). THERE WAS NO STATISTICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROUPS IN REGARDS TO PREOPERATIVE LM CT SCORES. CONCLUSIONS: YOUNG ADULTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO PRESENT WITH OVERALL HIGHER SUBJECTIVE SNOT-22 SCORES OVER ADULTS AND ELDERLY PATIENTS, DESPITE SIMILAR OBJECTIVE FINDINGS IN THE GROUPS.

WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT SNOT-22 SCORES AND RESPONSE PATTERNS COULD BE USED AS A DIAGNOSTIC TOOL TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN PATIENTS WITH CRS AND THOSE WHO PRESENT WITH CRS-LIKE SYMPTOMS BUT PROVE NOT TO HAVE CRS. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL: SNOT-22 MEASUREMENTS WERE COLLECTED FROM 311 PATIENTS WHO PRESENTED WITH A CHIEF COMPLAINT OF SINUSITIS TO A TERTIARY RHINOLOGY PRACTICE. FOLLOWING A FULL DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION, PATIENTS WERE DIAGNOSED WITH CRS OR DETERMINED TO HAVE NON-CRS DIAGNOSES. A RESPONSE PATTERN \"HEATMAP\" OF THE SNOT-22 SCORES FOR EACH GROUP WAS COMPARED. AN OPTIMAL CUTOFF POINT FOR TOTAL SNOT-22 SCORE IN PREDICTING CRS WAS SOUGHT USING A RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC (ROC) CURVE. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 109 PATIENTS WERE DIAGNOSED WITH CRS AND 202 PATIENTS WERE ASSIGNED TO NON-CRS. THE NON-CRS SNOT-22 TOTAL SCORE HISTOGRAM HAD LOWER OVERALL SCORES COMPARED TO THE CRS GROUP, ALTHOUGH THERE WAS SUBSTANTIAL OVERLAP. THE CRS SNOT-22 HEATMAPS HAD A DISTINCTIVE PATTERN COMPARED TO THE NON-CRS GROUP. AS INDIVIDUAL MEASURES, 3 OF THE 4 CARDINAL SYMPTOMS OF CRS (NASAL CONGESTION, LOSS OF SMELL, AND RHINORRHEA) WERE FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE 2 GROUPS (P < .002). HOWEVER, THE ROC ANALYSIS SHOWED THE TOTAL SNOT-22 SCORE TO BE A POOR INSTRUMENT TO DIFFERENTIATE CRS FROM NON-CRS PATIENTS. CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS CAUSE US TO REJECT OUR HYPOTHESIS AND CONCLUDE THAT, WHILE AN EFFECTIVE OUTCOMES TOOL, THE SNOT-22 (USING TOTAL SCORE AND RESPONSE PATTERN) IS A POOR DIFFERENTIATOR BETWEEN CRS AND NON-CRS PATIENTS.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY HEALTH SHREVEPORT, SHREVEPORT, LA, USA.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF UTAH, SALT LAKE CITY, UT, USA.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF UTAH, SALT LAKE CITY, UT, USA.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF UTAH, SALT LAKE CITY, UT, USA.;","ORCID: 0000-0002-8599-1637 ORCID: 0000-0001-9731-2200",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021/03/04 05:33","20211005","20210304",2021,"2021/03/05 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"11",NA,"1943-572X (ELECTRONIC) 0003-4894 (LINKING)","0407300","THE ANNALS OF OTOLOGY, RHINOLOGY, AND LARYNGOLOGY","ENG","10.1177/0003489421998213 [DOI]","20211005","2021/10/06 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","1220-1227","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"33657861","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"ANN OTOL RHINOL LARYNGOL. 2021 NOV;130(11):1220-1227.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORE PATTERNS IN PATIENTS WITH CONFIRMED NON-SINOGENIC HEADACHE IN ORDER TO DEVELOP NEGATIVE PREDICTORS OF CRS. METHODS: INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD (IRB)-APPROVED, RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH CRS OR NON-SINOGENIC HEADACHE DEFINED AS PATIENTS WITH A CHIEF COMPLAINT OF HEADACHE, FACIAL PAIN, AND FACIAL PRESSURE IN THE ABSENCE OF BOTH ENDOSCOPIC AND COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) EVIDENCE OF INFLAMMATION. THE OPTIMAL CUTOFF POINTS OF POTENTIAL PREDICTORS OF NON-SINOGENIC HEADACHE BY SNOT-22 SCORE WERE QUANTIFIED BY RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC (ROC) CURVE. THE NEGATIVE PREDICTIVE VALUES (NPVS) FOR CRS WERE CALCULATED IN A DISCOVERY POPULATION AND THEN VALIDATED IN AN INDEPENDENT POPULATION. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 724 (164 NON-SINOGENIC HEADACHE AND 560 CRS) AND 412 (88 NON-SINOGENIC HEADACHE AND 324 CRS) PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED IN THE DISCOVERY AND VALIDATION POPULATIONS, RESPECTIVELY.

AS SUCH, IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT COUNTS OF CELLULAR ELEMENTS BE INCLUDED AS PART OF A STANDARD PATHOLOGICAL REPORT FOLLOWING ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS). OBJECTIVES: THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY EVALUATED ASSOCIATIONS OF MUCOSAL EOSINOPHILIA AND NEUTROPHILIA WITH MEASURES OF QUALITY-OF-LIFE (QOL) AND OLFACTORY FUNCTION. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH MEDICALLY REFRACTORY CRS COMPLETED THE SNOT-22 SURVEY AND BRIEF SMELL IDENTIFICATION TEST (BSIT) AT ENROLLMENT. IN ADDITION, BASELINE LUND-MACKAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) AND LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPY SCORES WERE COLLECTED. ETHMOID MUCOSA WAS BIOPSIED DURING ESS AND REVIEWED USING MICROSCOPY TO QUANTIFY DENSEST INFILTRATE OF EOSINOPHILS OR NEUTROPHILS PER HIGH-POWERED-FIELD (HPF). EOSINOPHILIC CRS (ECRS) AND NEUTROPHILIC CRS (NCRS), BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT NASAL POLYPOSIS (NP), WERE COMPARED ACROSS SNOT-22 AND BSIT SCORES. RESULTS: 77/168 PATIENTS DEMONSTRATED MUCOSAL EOSINOPHILIA (ECRS) WHILE A TOTAL OF 42/168 PATIENTS DEMONSTRATED MUCOSAL NEUTROPHILIA (NCRS). AFTER ADJUSTING FOR POLYP STATUS, 35/168 HAD ECRSSNP, 42/168 ECRSWNP, 75/168 NON-ECRSSNP, 16/168 NON-ECRSWNP. ADDITIONALLY, 22/161 WERE NOTED TO HAVE NCRSSNP, 20/161 NCRSWNP, 84/161 NON-NCRSWNP, AND 35/161 NON-NCRSSNP. A SMALL SUBSET OF PATIENTS DEMONSTRATED BOTH EOSINOPHILIA AND NEUTROPHILIA: 14 CRSWNP AND 7 CRSSNP. WHEN EVALUATING AVERAGE LUND-MACKAY SCORES (LMS), SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES EXISTED BETWEEN NON-ECRSSNP AND ECRSSNP (P = 0.006). HOWEVER, AFTER CONTROLLING FOR NASAL POLYPS, EOSINOPHILIA DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATE WITH DIFFERENCES IN THE LUND-KENNEDY SCORE. NEUTROPHILIA DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATE WITH ANY CHANGES IN LMS OR LKS AFTER CONTROLLING FOR NP. EOSINOPHILIC AND NEUTROPHILIC HISTOPATHOLOGIC SUBTYPES DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATE WITH DIFFERENCES IN BASELINE SNOT-22 OR BSIT MEASURES AFTER CONTROLLING FOR NP. CONCLUSION: NEITHER THE PRESENCE OF MUCOSAL EOSINOPHILIA NOR MUCOSAL NEUTROPHILIA DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATIONS WITH SNOT-22 QUALITY-OF-LIFE OR BSIT OLFACTORY FUNCTION SCORES WHEN CONTROLLING FOR COMORBID NASAL POLYPOSIS.","DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND SINUS/SKULL BASE SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OREGON.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND SINUS/SKULL BASE SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OREGON.; DEPARTMENT OF PATHOLOGY, OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OREGON.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, OSCHNER HEALTH CENTER-WEST BANK, GRETNA, LOUISIANA.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND SINUS/SKULL BASE SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OREGON.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND SINUS/SKULL BASE SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OREGON.; PORTLAND VETERANS AFFAIRS HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, PORTLAND, OREGON.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND SINUS/SKULL BASE SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OREGON.;","ORCID: 0000-0002-5890-1325 ORCID: 0000-0002-6424-7083",NA,NA,NA,"DECLARATION OF CONFLICTING INTERESTS: THE AUTHOR(S) DECLARED NO POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WITH RESPECT TO THE RESEARCH, AUTHORSHIP, AND/OR PUBLICATION OF THIS ARTICLE.","2021/01/12 05:40","20210913","20210111",2021,"2021/01/13 06:00",NA,NA,"R01 DC005805/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/UNITED STATES","5",NA,"1945-8932 (ELECTRONIC) 1945-8924 (PRINT) 1945-8932 (LINKING)","101490775","AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RHINOLOGY & ALLERGY","ENG","10.1177/1945892420987439 [DOI]","20220216","2021/09/14 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","647-655",NA,"PMC8822192",NA,"33430615","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"AM J RHINOL ALLERGY. 2021 SEP;35(5):647-655.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY INCLUDED 64 PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS ACCORDING TO EPOS GUIDELINES. 32 PATIENTS HAD CORS, AND THE CONTROL GROUP WERE 32 PATIENTS WITH CNORS. PATIENTS WERE MATCHED ACCORDING TO GENDER AND AGE. ALL THE PATIENTS UNDERWENT A CT SCAN EVALUATED BY A RADIOLOGIST, AND WERE EVALUATED BY AN ORAL SURGEON AND OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGIST BEFORE BEING ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THE GROUPS. THE SEVERITY OF THE SYMPTOMS WAS ASSESSED THROUGH QUESTIONERS SNOT-22 (SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST) AND VAS (VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE) SYMPTOM SCORE. KOLMOGOROV-SMIRNOV'S, FISHER'S AND MANN-WHITNEY U TEST WERE USED IN THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE DATA. RESULTS: PEOPLE WITH CORS SHOW SIMILAR SYMPTOMATOLOGY ON SNOT-22 SCORE TO PATIENTS WITH CNORS, WITH NO SIGNIFICANT STATISTICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANY OF THE SNOT-22 SYMPTOMS.

PATTERNS MAY EXIST WITHIN CLINICAL DATA THAT CAN BE USEFUL FOR EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND PREDICTING OUTCOMES. OBJECTIVE: TO EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO DIFFERENTIATE PATTERNS IN PATIENT DATA IN ORDER TO DEVELOP CLINICALLY-MEANINGFUL DIAGNOSTIC GROUPS. METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY OF PROSPECTIVELY-ACQUIRED PATIENT DATA AT A TERTIARY RHINOLOGY CLINIC WAS PERFORMED. DATA EXTRACTED INCLUDED OBJECTIVE FINDINGS ON NASAL ENDOSCOPY, PATIENT REPORTED QUALITY OF LIFE (PRQOL) INSTRUMENT RATINGS, PERIPHERAL EOSINOPHIL FRACTION, AND PAST MEDICAL HISTORY. UNSUPERVISED NON-HIERARCHICAL CLUSTER ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED TO DISCOVER PATTERNS IN THE DATA USING 22 INPUT VARIABLES. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 545 PATIENTS WERE ANALYZED AFTER APPLICATION OF INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA YIELDING 7 UNIQUE PATIENT CLUSTERS, HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON PRQOL SCORES AND DEMOGRAPHICS. THE CLUSTERS WERE CLINICALLY-RELEVANT WITH DISTINCT CHARACTERISTICS. CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITHOUT NASAL POLYPOSIS (CRSSNP) WAS ASSOCIATED WITH TWO CLUSTERS HAVING LOW FREQUENCIES OF ASTHMA AND LOW EOSINOPHIL FRACTIONS. CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITH NASAL POLYPOSIS (CRSWNP) WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH FREQUENCY OF ASTHMA, MEAN (STANDARD DEVIATION [SD]) NOSE SCORES OF 66 (19) AND SNOT-22 SCORES OF 41 (15), AND HIGH EOSINOPHIL FRACTIONS. AR WAS PRESENT IN MULTIPLE CLUSTERS. RARS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE YOUNGEST POPULATION WITH MEAN (SD) NOSE SCORE OF 54 (23) AND SNOT-22 SCORE OF 41 (19). CONCLUSION: BROADER CONSIDERATION OF INITIALLY AVAILABLE CLINICAL DATA MAY IMPROVE DIAGNOSTIC EFFICIENCY FOR RHINOLOGIC CONDITIONS WITHOUT ANCILLARY STUDIES, USING COMPUTER-DRIVEN ALGORITHMS.

HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN REGARDING THE SYMPTOMS MOST IMPORTANT TO PATIENTS AND HOW THESE IMPACT EXPECTATIONS AND POSTOPERATIVE SATISFACTION. METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE, MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL COHORT STUDY OF 100 CRS PATIENTS UNDERGOING ESS COMPLETED A NOVEL ADAPTATION OF THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) WHEREIN THEY RATED HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS FOR SPECIFIC SYMPTOMS TO IMPROVE AFTER SURGERY, ALONG WITH PREOPERATIVE EXPECTATIONS AND POSTOPERATIVE SATISFACTION. THE PRIMARY SATISFACTION MEASURE WAS WHETHER A PATIENT WOULD CHOOSE TO UNDERGO ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS) AGAIN. A MULTIVARIATE, LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL WAS BUILT USING DEMOGRAPHICS, OBJECTIVE MEASURES, AND THE ADAPTED SNOT-22 DATA. SPEARMAN CORRELATION ANALYSIS WAS ALSO PERFORMED. RESULTS: NASAL OBSTRUCTION WAS RATED AS \"EXTREMELY\" OR \"VERY\" IMPORTANT BY 93% OF PATIENTS, FOLLOWED BY SMELL/TASTE, THICK NASAL DISCHARGE, NEED TO BLOW NOSE, POSTNASAL DISCHARGE, AND SLEEP SYMPTOMS (RANGE, 61-72%). SYMPTOMS LIKE SADNESS AND EMBARRASSMENT WERE NOT CONSIDERED IMPORTANT BY PREOPERATIVE PATIENTS (=28%). IN MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION, POSTOPERATIVE SATISFACTION DEPENDED ON PREOPERATIVE EXPECTATIONS BEING MET AND ESS IMPROVING THEIR MOST IMPORTANT SYMPTOMS (ODDS RATO, 19.6-27.5; P < 0.005). POSTOPERATIVE SATISFACTION WAS NOT CORRELATED WITH ACHIEVING A MINIMAL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE, BUT IT WAS CORRELATED WITH MAGNITUDE OF CHANGE IN SNOT-22 (R = 0.35; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: NASAL, SMELL, AND SLEEP-RELATED SYMPTOMS WERE CONSDIDERED MOST IMPORTANT BY THIS COHORT. MEETING OF PREOPERATIVE EXPECTATIONS, IMPROVEMENT OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SYMPTOMS, AND THE MAGNITUDE OF CHANGE IN THE SNOT-22 MAY DRIVE POSTOPERATIVE SATISFACTION.","DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND SINUS SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY, CALGARY, AB, CANADA.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND SINUS SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.; DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, RALPH H.; JOHNSON VA MEDICAL CENTER, CHARLESTON, SC.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OR.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OR.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF UTAH SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, SALT LAKE CITY, UT.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND SINUS SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.;","ORCID: 0000-0001-8766-1626 ORCID: 0000-0002-6424-7083 ORCID: 0000-0003-0560-5028","© 2019 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,"POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: DR.

HOWEVER, THERE ARE NO UTILITY VALUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SNOT-22, LIMITING ITS USE IN COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ESTABLISH UTILITIES FOR THE SNOT-22 BY MAPPING RESPONSES TO UTILITY VALUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EUROQOL-5-DIMENSIONAL QUESTIONNAIRE-3-LEVEL VERSION (EQ-5D-3L). METHODS: THIS STUDY USED DATA COLLECTED FROM PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH CRS AWAITING BILATERAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY IN VANCOUVER, CANADA. STUDY PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED BOTH THE SNOT-22 AND THE EQ-5D-3L. ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES WAS USED FOR 3 MODELS THAT ESTIMATED THE EQ-5D-3L UTILITY VALUES AS A FUNCTION OF THE SNOT-22 ITEMS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 232 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED BOTH THE SNOT-22 AND THE EQ-5D-3L. AS EXPECTED, THERE WAS A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SNOT-22 GLOBAL SCORES AND EQ-5D-3L UTILITY VALUES.

AS WEAK CORRELATIONS BETWEEN OBJECTIVE CRS PARAMETERS AND SNOT-22 TOTAL SCORE HAVE BEEN OBSERVED, FACTOR ANALYSES HAVE AIMED TO IDENTIFY UNDERLYING FACTORIAL STRUCTURES. HOWEVER, AMBIGUOUS FACTOR LOADINGS AND PROBLEMATIC ITEM-DOMAIN ASSIGNMENTS HAVE RESULTED. MOREOVER, SUCH FACTOR ANALYSES HAVE MAINLY BEEN PERFORMED IN NON-EUROPEAN CRS PATIENTS, WHILE EUROPEAN DATA REMAIN SPARSE. THIS STUDY THUS SOUGHT TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. METHODS: PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS AND CONFIRMATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS WERE PERFORMED FROM SNOT-22 QUESTIONNAIRES COMPLETED BY EUROPEAN CRS PATIENTS. GOODNESS OF FIT, INTERNAL CONSISTENCIES, AND FACTOR LOADINGS WERE CALCULATED. ITEM-DOMAIN ASSIGNMENT WAS BASED ON STATISTICAL GROUNDS AND CLINICAL MEANINGFULNESS. ADDITIONALLY, THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED CORRELATIONS BETWEEN SNOT-22 DOMAINS AND EXTERNAL REFERENCE CRITERIA, INCLUDING LUND-MACKAY SCORE, LUND-NACLERIO SCORE AND THE BRIEF SYMPTOM INVENTORY 18 (BSI-18). RESULTS: ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-FOUR EUROPEAN CRS PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED. PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS PROPOSED FOUR SNOT-22 DOMAINS (\"NASAL SYMPTOMS\", \"OTOLOGIC SYMPTOMS\", \"SLEEP SYMPTOMS\", \"EMOTIONAL SYMPTOMS\"), WHICH EXPLAINED 63.6% OF VARIANCE. OBSERVED ITEM-DOMAIN-ASSIGNMENT DIFFERED FROM PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED ITEM-DOMAIN ASSIGNMENTS. ALL FACTOR LOADINGS WERE > 0.5, EXCEPT \"COUGH\" (0.42) AND \"FACIAL PAIN OR PRESSURE\" (0.49). FOR CONFIRMATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS, SATISFACTORY GOODNESS OF FIT (RMSEA = 0.66; CFI = 0.92; TLI = 0.90) AND INTERNAL CONSISTENCIES (CRONBACH-<U+0391>: TOTAL SCORE = 0.93; DOMAINS = 0.75-0.91) WERE OBSERVED. SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATIONS WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE \"NASAL SYMPTOMS\" DOMAIN AND BOTH THE LUND-MACKAY SCORE (R = 0.48; P < 0.001) AND THE LUND-NACLERIO SCORE (R = 0.27, P < 0.01). SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATIONS WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED BETWEEN \"EMOTIONAL SYMPTOMS\" AND BSI-18 TOTAL SCORE (R = 0.64, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS PERFORMED FOR SNOT-22 QUESTIONNAIRES COMPLETED BY EUROPEAN CRS PATIENTS INDICATED A DIFFERENT ITEM-DOMAIN-ASSIGNMENT THAN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED. CONFIRMATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS SUGGESTED ACCEPTABLE AND CLINICALLY PLAUSIBLE PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES FOR THE RESULTING FACTORIAL STRUCTURE.

THE OVERARCHING AIM IS TO DETERMINE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE ONSET AND SEVERITY OF CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS). THE AIM OF THIS ANALYSIS IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THOSE WITH CRS ARE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT PSYCHIATRIC MORBIDITY AND IN PARTICULAR MOOD DISTURBANCE COMPARED WITH HEALTHY CONTROLS. METHODS: CRES CONSISTS OF A STUDY-SPECIFIC QUESTIONNAIRE REGARDING DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS AND PAST MEDICAL HISTORY AS WELL AS A NASAL SYMPTOM SCORE (SNOT-22) AND SF-36 (QOL - QUALITY OF LIFE TOOL). BOTH OF THESE TOOLS CONTAIN MENTAL HEALTH OR EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING DOMAINS. PARTICIPANTS WERE SPECIFICALLY ASKED WHETHER THEY HAD EVER CONSULTED WITH THEIR GENERAL PRACTITIONER FOR ANXIETY OR DEPRESSION. QUESTIONNAIRES WERE DISTRIBUTED TO PATIENTS WITH CRS ATTENDING ENT OUTPATIENT CLINICS AT 30 CENTRES ACROSS THE UNITED KINGDOM FROM 2007-2013. CONTROLS WERE ALSO RECRUITED AT THESE SITES. PATIENTS WERE DIVIDED INTO SUBGROUPS OF CRS ACCORDING TO THE ABSENCE/PRESENCE OF POLYPS (CRSSNPS/CRSWNPS) OR ALLERGIC FUNGAL RHINOSINUSITIS (AFRS). RESULTS: CONSULTATIONS WITH A FAMILY PHYSICIAN FOR DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY WERE HIGHER AMONGST THOSE WITH CRS THAN CONTROLS, BUT THIS WAS ONLY SIGNIFICANT FOR THOSE WITH CRSSNPS. ODDS RATIO (OR) FOR CRSSNPS VS CONTROLS: 1.89; OR FOR CRSWNPS: 1.40. PATIENTS WITH CRS SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER MENTAL HEALTH MORBIDITY THAN CONTROLS ACROSS THE MENTAL HEALTH AND EMOTIONAL WELLBEING DOMAINS OF THE SF-36 AND SNOT-22. MEAN DIFFERENCE IN THE MENTAL HEALTH DOMAIN OF SF-36 WAS 8.3 FOR CRSSNPS AND 5.3 FOR CRSWNPS. FOR THE EMOTIONAL DOMAIN OF SNOT-22, DIFFERENCES WERE 7.7 AND 6.3 RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSIONS: DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE COMMON IN PATIENTS WITH CRS COMPARED TO HEALTHY CONTROLS, ESPECIALLY IN THOSE WITH CRSSNPS. THIS ADDED MENTAL HEALTH MORBIDITY NEEDS CONSIDERATION WHEN MANAGING THESE PATIENTS IN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY CARE SETTINGS.","NORWICH MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA, NORWICH, UNITED KINGDOM.; GUYS AND ST THOMAS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM.; NORWICH MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA, NORWICH, UNITED KINGDOM.; ENT DEPARTMENT, HEART OF ENGLAND NHS FOUNDATION TRUST, BIRMINGHAM, UNITED KINGDOM.; ENT DEPARTMENT, SOUTHERN GENERAL HOSPITAL, GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UNITED KINGDOM.; ENT DEPARTMENT, ROYAL SURREY COUNTY HOSPITAL, GUILDFORD, UNITED KINGDOM.; OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURG.; INSTITUTE OF HEALTH AND SOCIETY, NEWCASTLE UNIVERSITY, NEWCASTLE, UNITED KINGDOM.; NORWICH MEDICAL SCHOOL, NORWICH, UNITED KINGDOM.; NORWICH MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA, NORWICH, UNITED KINGDOM.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017/04/24 06:00","20170717",NA,2017,"2017/04/24 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,"0300-0729 (PRINT) 0300-0729 (LINKING)","0347242","RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.4193/RHIN16.111 [DOI]","20170717","2017/07/18 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","113-119","NETHERLANDS",NA,NA,"28434016","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"RHINOLOGY. 2017 JUN 1;55(2):113-119.

IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN SPECIFIC RHINOLOGIC DISORDERS (CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS [CRS], RHINITIS, AND NASAL SEPTAL DEVIATION [NSD]) IS AN OBSTRUCTIVE PHENOMENON OR DUE TO OTHER MECHANISMS. IN THIS REVIEW WE EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF CRS, RHINITIS, AND NSD ON OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE SLEEP OUTCOME METRICS AND DRAW COMPARISONS TO NORMAL CONTROLS AND PATIENTS WITH KNOWN OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA (OSA). METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF 4 DATABASES (PUBMED, SCOPUS, COCHRANE LIBRARY, AND WEB OF SCIENCE) WAS PERFORMED. STUDIES REPORTING ON OBJECTIVE (APNEA-HYPOPNEA INDEX [AHI], RESPIRATORY DISTURBANCE INDEX [RDI], OXYGEN NADIR) AND SUBJECTIVE (EPWORTH SLEEPINESS SCALE [EPSS], PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX [PSQI], FATIGUE SEVERITY SCALE [FSS]) SLEEP PARAMETERS AND DISEASE-SPECIFIC PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME MEASURES (PROMS; 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST [SNOT-22], RHINOCONJUNCTIVITIS QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE [RQLQ], NASAL OBSTRUCTION SYMPTOM EVALUATION [NOSE]) WERE INCLUDED. RESULTS: THE DATABASE SEARCH YIELDED 1414 UNIQUE ARTICLES, OF WHICH 103 WERE INCLUDED FOR ANALYSIS. BASELINE PROMS WERE AT THE HIGH END OF NORMAL TO ABNORMAL FOR ALL 3 CONDITIONS: EPSS: CRS (9.8 ± 4.0), RHINITIS (9.7 ± 4.3), AND NSD (8.9 ± 4.6); AND PSQI: CRS (11.0 ± 4.5), RHINITIS (6.1 ± 3.7), AND NSD (8.6 ± 3.5). OBJECTIVE MEASURES DEMONSTRATED A MILD TO MODERATE OSA IN THE STUDIED DISEASES: AHI: CRS (10.4 ± 11.5), RHINITIS (8.6 ± 8.8), AND NSD (13.0 ± 6.9). THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WHEN COMPARED WITH REPORTED NORMS IN ALL MEASURED OUTCOMES (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: SLEEP QUALITY IS IMPACTED BY RHINOLOGIC (CRS, RHINITIS, NSD) DISEASE. THERE IS LIKELY A MILD OBSTRUCTIVE COMPONENT CONTRIBUTING TO POOR SLEEP, BUT OTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTORS MAY BE INVOLVED.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IRVING MEDICAL CENTER, NEW YORK, NY.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, BALTIMORE, MD.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.;","ORCID: 0000-0002-2704-1086 ORCID: 0000-0003-1296-2648","© 2020 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2020/12/04 12:10","20210929","20201204",2021,"2020/12/05 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"7",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.22740 [DOI]","20210929","2021/09/30 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","1074-1086","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"33275331","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2021 JUL;11(7):1074-1086.

RECENT EVIDENCE SUGGESTS CRS INFLAMMATORY SIGNATURES DEPEND ON AGE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER AGE ALSO INFLUENCES QUALITY-OF-LIFE (QOL) AND POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES. METHODS: RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF PROSPECTIVELY COLLECTED QOL DATA FROM 403 ADULTS WITH MEDICALLY REFRACTORY CRS WHO UNDERWENT FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (FESS) AT A TERTIARY CARE MEDICAL CENTER BETWEEN 2014 AND 2018 WAS UNDERTAKEN. TOTAL AND SUBDOMAIN SCORES FROM THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AND THE SHORT FORM 8 HEALTH SURVEY (SF-8) MEASURE OF GENERAL HEALTH COMPLETED AT PREOPERATIVE AND POSTOPERATIVE VISITS WERE REVIEWED. RESULTS: PATIENTS WERE DIVIDED INTO YOUNG (18 TO 39 YEARS, N = 100), MIDDLE-AGED (40 TO 59 YEARS, N = 172), AND ELDERLY (=60 YEARS, N = 131) GROUPS. BASELINE TOTAL SNOT-22 SCORES DIFFERED BETWEEN GROUPS (P = 0.01), WITH MIDDLE-AGED PATIENTS HAVING THE HIGHEST SYMPTOM BURDEN AND ELDERLY PATIENTS HAVING THE LOWEST. SIMILAR PATTERNS WERE OBSERVED FOR SNOT-22 SUBDOMAINS. ELDERLY PATIENTS REPORTED SMALLER IMPROVEMENTS AND WERE LESS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE A MINIMALLY IMPORTANT CLINICAL DIFFERENCE. CRS PATIENTS HAD WORSE SF-8 SCORES COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION, AND ELDERLY PATIENTS WERE THE LEAST LIKELY TO MATCH POPULATION NORMS FOLLOWING SURGERY. AGE WAS AN INDEPENDENT PREDICTOR OF QOL OUTCOMES AFTER FESS. CONCLUSION: AGE MAY PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN CRS PATHOPHYSIOLOGY, SYMPTOM BURDEN, AND SURGICAL OUTCOMES. ELDERLY PATIENTS REPORT SMALLER IMPROVEMENTS IN DISEASE-SPECIFIC AND GENERAL HEALTH QOL AFTER SURGERY. CRS MANAGEMENT IN THE ELDERLY POPULATION SHOULD INCORPORATE AGE-DEPENDENT DIFFERENCES IN SYMPTOM BURDEN AND EXPECTATIONS INTO TREATMENT ALGORITHMS.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, NASHVILLE, TN.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, NASHVILLE, TN.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, NASHVILLE, TN.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, NASHVILLE, TN.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, NASHVILLE, TN.;",NA,"© 2019 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,"DISCLOSURE OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: N.I.

THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE MAGNITUDE AND SEQUENCE OF SYMPTOM IMPROVEMENT AFTER ESS FOR CRS, AND TO ASSESS THE POSSIBLE PREOPERATIVE FACTORS THAT PREDICT SURGICAL OUTCOMES IN CRS PATIENTS. METHODS: THIS WAS A LONGITUDINAL PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF 68 PATIENTS WHO HAD CRS (WITH OR WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS). THE PATIENTS UNDERWENT ESS AT KING FAHD HOSPITAL OF THE UNIVERSITY, AL KHOBAR, SAUDI ARABIA. THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22) QUESTIONNAIRE WAS USED FOR ASSESSMENT AT FOUR TIME POINTS DURING THE STUDY: PRE-ESS, 1-WEEK POST-ESS, 4 WEEKS POST-ESS, AND 6 MONTHS POST-ESS. RESULTS: THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MEAN SCORES RECORDED FOR THE FIVE SNOT-22 DOMAINS PRE-ESS AND 6 MONTHS POST-ESS WERE AS FOLLOWS: RHINOLOGIC SYMPTOMS (T-TEST = 7.22, P-VALUE =  < 0.001); EXTRA-NASAL RHINOLOGIC SYMPTOMS (T-TEST = 4.87, P-VALUE =  < 0.001); EAR/FACIAL SYMPTOMS (T-TEST = 6.34, P-VALUE =  < 0.001); PSYCHOLOGICAL DYSFUNCTION (T-TEST = 1.99, P-VALUE = 0.049); AND SLEEP DYSFUNCTION (T-TEST = 5.58, P-VALUE =  < 0.001). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MEAN SCORES RECORDED FOR THE FIVE DOMAINS PRE-ESS AND 6 MONTHS POST-ESS. RHINOLOGIC SYMPTOMS HAD THE LARGEST EFFECT SIZE (D = 1.12), WHEREAS PSYCHOLOGICAL DYSFUNCTION HAD THE LEAST EFFECT SIZE (D = 0.24). THE ONLY STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE SNOT-22 MEAN SCORES RECORDED 4 WEEKS POST-ESS WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN ALLERGIC AND NON-ALLERGIC PATIENTS (T = - 2.16, DF = 66, P = 0.035).

ETD PREVALENCE WAS 68% IN CRSSNP, 48% IN CRSWNP, AND 88% IN RARS. PATIENTS WITH ETD HAD A MEAN BASELINE ETDQ-7 OF 25.8 ± 8.0 AND IMPROVED POSTOPERATIVELY AT 2 WEEKS (19.9 ± 8.1, P < .001), 6 WEEKS (17.8 ± 9.3, P < .001), 3 MONTHS (16.8 ± 8.5, P < .001), AND 6 MONTHS (16.4 ± 7.9, P < .001). AT 6 MONTHS, ETD IMPROVED IN 89% OF PATIENTS WITH CRSSNP, 68% WITH CRSWNP, AND 78% WITH RARS. ON MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS, ETD IMPROVEMENT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER PREOPERATIVE ETDQ-7 SCORE (ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO [AOR], 1.12; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], 1.04-1.22; P = .030), HIGHER PREOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORE (AOR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.02-1.08; P = .001), HIGHER PREOPERATIVE SNOT-22 EAR SUBSCORE (AOR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.02-1.65; P = .034), POSTERIOR ETHMOIDECTOMY (AOR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.22-4.92; P = .025), AND POSTOPERATIVE CORTICOSTEROID SPRAY USE (AOR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.17-1.66; P = .008). CONCLUSION: ETD SYMPTOMS OFTEN IMPROVE FOLLOWING ESS. FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENT INCLUDE HIGHER PREOPERATIVE DISEASE BURDEN, POSTERIOR ETHMOIDECTOMY, AND POSTOPERATIVE CORTICOSTEROID SPRAY.

STANDARD TREATMENT REGIMENS ARE AIMED AT REMOVING POLYPS AND REDUCING THE ACTIVITY OF INFLAMMATION, WHILE LITTLE ATTENTION IS PAID TO PATHOGENESIS FACTORS SUCH AS OXIDATIVE STRESS AND MUCOCILIARY INSUFFICIENCY. OBJECTIVE: TO IMPROVE THE COMBINED TREATMENT OF PRS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: THE STUDY INVOLVED 98 PATIENTS (50 PEOPLE - THE STUDY GROUP, 48 PEOPLE - CONTROL GROUP). THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMORBID PATHOLOGY OF PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP WAS SELECTED SO AS TO CORRESPOND TO THE PATHOLOGY IN THE STUDY GROUP. PATIENTS OF BOTH GROUPS RECEIVED COMBINED TREATMENT, INCLUDING SURGICAL TREATMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FESS PRINCIPLES, FOLLOWED BY THE PRESCRIPTION OF 200 MCG MOMETASONE FUROATE IN EACH HALF OF THE NOSE FOR 6 MONTHS. THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS OF THE STUDY GROUP ALSO INCLUDED THE DRUG N-ACETYLCYSTEINE - 3 ML (300 MG) IN EACH MAXILLARY SINUS INTRASURGICALY, THEN 600 MG ORALLY IN THE MORNING AFTER MEALS FOR 6 MONTHS. SURVEY METHODS INCLUDED A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY USING THE SNOT-22 QUESTIONNAIRE, THE PREVALENCE OF THE POLYPOUS PROCESS WAS ASSESSED BY ENDOSCOPY (CLAUS BACHERT SCALE) AND CT (LUND-MACKAY SCALE), AND MUCOCILIARY FUNCTION WAS ALSO EVALUATED BY PERFORMING A SACCHARIN TEST. THE RESULTS WERE COMPARED WITH EACH OTHER BEFORE SURGERY AND AFTER 6, 12 AND 24 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY. RESULTS: PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN TAKING N-ACETYLCYSTEINE FOR A LONG TIME HAVE A MORE PRONOUNCED AND LONG-TERM IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR GENERAL CONDITION (ACCORDING TO SNOT-22, AN AVERAGE BY 1.7 TIMES, P<0.05) COMPARED WITH PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP. ALSO, THE FREQUENCY OF RELAPSES DECREASES AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SURGICAL TREATMENT INCREASES (ACCORDING TO THE LUND-MACKEY SCALE - 5.02 IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND 10.75 IN THE CONTROL; ACCORDING TO S. BACHERT - 1 POINT AND 3 POINTS, RESPECTIVELY). CONCLUSIONS: LONG-TERM USE OF N-ACETYLCYSTEINE IN PRS INCREASES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SURGICAL TREATMENT, REDUCES THE FREQUENCY OF RELAPSES, AND ALSO IMPROVES THE GENERAL CONDITION OF PATIENTS.","TYUMEN STATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH OF RUSSIA, TYUMEN, RUSSIA.; NEFTYANIK HOSPITAL, TYUMEN, RUSSIA.; TYUMEN STATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH OF RUSSIA, TYUMEN, RUSSIA.; NEFTYANIK HOSPITAL, TYUMEN, RUSSIA.; NEFTYANIK HOSPITAL, TYUMEN, RUSSIA.; SVERZHEVSKY RESEARCH CLINICAL INSTITUTE OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY OF THE MOSCOW HEALTHCARE DEPARTMENT, MOSCOW, RUSSIA.;","ORCID: 0000-0002-7025-4925 ORCID: 0000-0002-4334-3789 ORCID: 0000-0003-3140-1715",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020/07/07 06:00","20200826",NA,2020,"2020/07/07 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,"0042-4668 (PRINT) 0042-4668 (LINKING)","0416577","VESTNIK OTORINOLARINGOLOGII","RUS","10.17116/OTORINO20208503148 [DOI]","20200826","2020/08/28 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","48-51","RUSSIA (FEDERATION)",NA,NA,"32628383","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"VESTN OTORINOLARINGOL. 2020;85(3):48-51.

WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE MOST PREVALENTLY UTILIZED INSTRUMENTS DO NOT STRONGLY CORRELATE IN ALL DOMAINS, BUT RATHER ACT IN COMPLEMENTARY FASHION FOR QOL ASSESSMENT. METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW (MEDLINE) WAS PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY THE TYPE AND FREQUENCY OF AVAILABLE CRS-SPECIFIC QOL INSTRUMENTS. UNIVARIATE ANALYSES OF THE 3 MOST COMMON INSTRUMENTS (RHINOSINUSITIS DISABILITY INDEX [RSDI], CHRONIC SINUSITIS SURVEY [CSS] AND 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOMES TEST [SNOT-22]) WERE PERFORMED USING A MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL PROSPECTIVE COHORT OF SINUSITIS PATIENTS. RESULTS: SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW FOUND THAT THE SNOT-20 (AND ITS DERIVATIVES), RSDI, AND CSS ARE THE MOST COMMONLY UTILIZED CRS-SPECIFIC QOL INSTRUMENTS. THE MAJORITY OF RSDI DOMAINS WERE WEAKLY OR NOT CORRELATED WITH THE CSS DOMAINS (R = 0.097-0.501; P < 0.001). IN CONTRAST, THE RSDI WAS HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH THE SNOT-22 (R = 0.666; P < 0.001). PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA AND/OR ALLERGIES REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE CSS SCORES (P < 0.001). COMORBIDITIES HAD NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON RSDI OR SNOT-22 RESPONSES. CONCLUSION: DIFFERENT DISEASE-SPECIFIC CRS QOL INSTRUMENTS MEASURE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE PATIENT'S EXPERIENCE. THE RSDI AND SNOT-22 ARE MORE SENSITIVE TO MEASURING THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT OF CRS, WHEREAS THE CSS EXAMINES MEDICATION USE AND SYMPTOMS.

OUR OBJECTIVES WERE TO: 1) DETERMINE IF PATIENTS WITH LONGER SYMPTOM DURATION HAVE WORSE PREOPERATIVE DISEASE SEVERITY AND/OR QOL, AND 2) DETERMINE IF DELAYED SURGICAL INTERVENTION INFLUENCES OUTCOMES OF ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS). METHODS: PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH CRS WERE PROSPECTIVELY ENROLLED INTO A MULTICENTER COHORT STUDY AND OBSERVED 14.7 (STANDARD DEVIATON {SD} ± 4.8) MONTHS ON AVERAGE FOLLOWING PRIMARY ESS. PREOPERATIVE SYMPTOM DURATION WAS STRATIFIED INTO SHORT-TERM (< 12 MONTHS), MIDDLE-TERM (12-60 MONTHS), AND LONG-TERM (> 60 MONTHS). DISEASE SEVERITY WAS ASSESSED USING ENDOSCOPY AND COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY. DISEASE-SPECIFIC QOL WAS MEASURED WITH THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AND RHINOSINUSITIS DISABILITY INDEX. ADJUSTED BIVARIATE AND MULTIVARIATE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN SYMPTOM DURATION, DISEASE SEVERITY, AND QOL SCORES WERE EVALUATED. RESULTS: ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN PATIENTS MET INCLUSION CRITERIA WITH 35 PATIENTS LOST TO POSTOPERATIVE FOLLOW-UP. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN PREOPERATIVE DISEASE SEVERITY OR QOL SCORES WERE REPORTED BETWEEN SYMPTOM DURATION SUBGROUPS. PARTICIPANTS IN THE LONG-TERM SYMPTOM SUBGROUP REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER MEAN POSTOPERATIVE IMPROVEMENT ON SNOT-22 TOTAL SCORES (N = 28; -36.3[± 22.2]) COMPARED TO BOTH SHORT-TERM (N = 27; -23.4[SD ± 11.3]; P = 0.039) AND MIDDLE-TERM (N = 23; -23.5[SD ± 20.1]; P = 0.050) SUBGROUPS. POSTOPERATIVE QOL IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LONG-TERM SYMPTOM SUBGROUP REMAINED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER (P = 0.036) AFTER MULTIVARIATE ADJUSTMENT. CONCLUSIONS: SYMPTOM DURATION WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH MEAN PREOPERATIVE DISEASE SEVERITY OR QOL.

IN THIS STUDY, WE COMPARE DEMOGRAPHIC, SUBJECTIVE, AND OBJECTIVE CLINICAL FINDINGS OF PATIENTS WITH PHS VERSUS CRS. METHODS: WE RETROSPECTIVELY REVIEWED A DATABASE OF PATIENTS PRESENTING TO A SINGLE TERTIARY CARE RHINOLOGY CLINIC FROM DECEMBER 2011-JULY 2017. SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT) SCORES AND LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPY SCORES WERE OBTAINED. LUND-MACKAY CT SCORES WERE CALCULATED, IF AVAILABLE. REQUIREMENT OF HEADACHE SPECIALIST MANAGEMENT WAS COMPARED BETWEEN PHS AND CRS GROUPS. PATIENTS WITH BOTH CRS AND PHS (CRSCPHS) THAT REQUIRED HEADACHE SPECIALIST MANAGEMENT WERE COMPARED TO PATIENTS WITH CRS WITHOUT PHS (CRSSPHS) AND PATIENTS WITH PHS ALONE USING KRUSKAL-WALLIS ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE. RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC (ROC) ANALYSES WERE CARRIED OUT TO DETERMINE SIGNIFICANT DIAGNOSTIC THRESHOLDS. RESULTS: ONE-HUNDRED FOUR PHS PATIENTS AND 130 CRS PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED. PHS PATIENTS (72.1%) WERE MORE LIKELY THAN CRS PATIENTS TO REQUIRE HEADACHE SPECIALIST MANAGEMENT (6.9%, P<0.0001). CRSSPHS PATIENTS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NASAL DOMAIN SCORES COMPARED TO PHS PATIENTS (P = 0.042) BUT NOT COMPARED TO CRSCPHS PATIENTS (P>0.99). CRSCPHS (P = 0.0003) AND PHS (P<0.0001) SUBGROUPS OF PATIENTS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AURAL/FACIAL DOMAIN SCORES COMPARED TO CRSSPHS PATIENTS. PHS PATIENTS ALSO HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SLEEP DOMAINS SCORES COMPARED TO CRSSPHS PATIENTS (P<0.0001). BOTH CRSCPHS AND CRSSPHS SUBGROUPS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NASAL ENDOSCOPY SCORES (P<0.0001) AND CT SCORES (P = 0.04 & P<0.0001, RESPECTIVELY) COMPARED TO THE PHS GROUP. AURAL/FACIAL DOMAIN SCORE OF 4, NASAL ENDOSCOPY SCORE OF 4, AND CT SCORE OF 2 WERE FOUND TO BE RELIABLE DIAGNOSTIC THRESHOLDS FOR ABSENCE OF CRS. CONCLUSIONS: THE SNOT-22 MAY BE USED TO DISTINGUISH PHS FROM CRS BASED UPON THE AURAL/FACIAL AND SLEEP DOMAINS.

THIS STUDY AIMED TO COMPARE THE EXPRESSION OF SEVERAL MIRNAS IN TISSUE SAMPLES OBTAINED FROM PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP AND CONTROLS AND TO EVALUATE IF MIRNAS CORRELATE TO A SPECIFIC INFLAMMATORY PATTERN (T1, T2, T17, AND TREG) OR INTENSITY OF SYMPTOMS IN CRSWNP. METHODS: NASAL POLYPS (FROM PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP - N=36) AND MIDDLE TURBINATE MUCOSA (FROM CONTROL PATIENTS - N=41) WERE COLLECTED. MICROARRAY DETERMINED HUMAN MATURE MIRNA EXPRESSION, AND THE RESULTS OBTAINED WERE VALIDATED BY QPCR. MIRNAS THAT WERE DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED WERE THEN CORRELATED TO CYTOKINE PROTEINS (BY LUMINEX), TISSUE EOSINOPHILIA, AND SNOT-22. RESULTS: AFTER MICROARRAY AND QPCR ANALYSES, SIX MICRORNAS WERE UP-REGULATED IN CRSWNP SAMPLES WHEN COMPARED WITH CONTROLS: MIR-205-5P, MIR-221-3P, MIR-222-3P, MIR-378A-3P, MIR-449A AND MIR-449B-5P. ALL THESE MIRNAS ARE DIRECTLY IMPLICATED WITH CELL CYCLE REGULATION AND APOPTOSIS, AND TO A MINOR EXTENT, WITH INFLAMMATION. IMPORTANTLY, MIR-205-5P SHOWED A SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE CORRELATION WITH IL-5 CONCENTRATION AND EOSINOPHIL COUNT AT THE TISSUE AND WITH THE WORST SNOT-22 SCORE. CONCLUSIONS: MIRNA 205-5P WAS INCREASED IN CRSWNP COMPARED TO CONTROLS, AND IT WAS ESPECIALLY EXPRESSED IN CRSWNP PATIENTS WITH HIGHER T2 INFLAMMATION (MEASURED BY BOTH IL-5 LEVELS AND LOCAL EOSINOPHILIA) AND WORST CLINICAL PRESENTATION.

OUR GOAL WAS TO IDENTIFY CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH AVOIDANCE OF ACTIVITIES DUE TO CRS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 194 CRS PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED. CRS SYMPTOM BURDEN WAS ASSESSED WITH THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). SNOT-22 NASAL, SLEEP, EAR/FACIAL DISCOMFORT AND EMOTIONAL/PSYCHOLOGICAL SUBDOMAIN SCORES WERE CALCULATED. DEPRESSED MOOD WAS ASSESSED USING THE TWO-ITEM PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE (PHQ-2). PERSONALITY TRAITS INCLUDING CONSCIENTIOUSNESS, NEUROTICISM, AGREEABLENESS, OPENNESS, AND EXTRAVERSION WERE ASSESSED USING THE BIG FIVE INVENTORY-10 (BFI-10) QUESTIONNAIRE. AS THE PRIMARY OUTCOME, PARTICIPANTS RATED HOW OFTEN IN THE PRIOR WEEK THAT THEY HAD AVOIDED ANY ACTIVITIES IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE DUE TO THEIR NASAL OR SINUS SYMPTOMS ON A SCALE OF \"NEVER,\" \"RARELY,\" \"SOMETIMES,\" \"OFTEN,\" OR \"EXTREMELY OFTEN.\" ORDINAL REGRESSION MODELS, WITH BOOTSTRAP VALIDATION, WERE USED TO IDENTIFY ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN ACTIVITY AVOIDANCE AND PARTICIPANTS' CHARACTERISTICS. RESULTS: ON MULTIVARIABLE ANALYSIS, SNOT-22 SCORE (ODDS RATIO [OR] = 1.03, 95% CI, 1.01-1.04, P = .026), AND CONSCIENTIOUSNESS PERSONALITY TRAIT (OR = 1.38, 95% CI, 1.05-1.81, P = .019) WERE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH ACTIVITY AVOIDANCE WHILE AGE (OR = 0.98, 95% CI, 0.96-0.99, P = .049) WAS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH ACTIVITY AVOIDANCE.

OBJECTIVE: OUR AIM WAS TO DEFINE CLEAR INDICATION(S) FOR SINUS SURGICAL TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC ODONTOGENIC RHINOSINUSITIS AFTER ELIMINATION OF ODONTOGENIC CAUSE. METHODS: A GROUP OF 96 PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC ODONTOGENIC RHINOSINUSITIS CAUSED BY APICAL PERIODONTITIS COMPLETED A SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST 22 (SNOT-22) QUESTIONNAIRE WITH INCORPORATED ADDITIONAL SYMPTOM \"MALODOR\" BEFORE TREATMENT. MOREOVER, THEY WERE DISTRIBUTED ACCORDING TO COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) RADIOLOGICAL CRITERIA SUCH AS DEGREE OF PERIAPICAL PATHOLOGY, ANATOMICAL RATIO BETWEEN MAXILLARY LATERAL TEETH AND SINUS FLOOR, SINUS MUCOSAL THICKENING, AND OSTIOMEATAL COMPLEX CONDITION. THE ELIMINATION OF ODONTOGENIC CAUSE WAS PERFORMED BY EXTRACTING CAUSATIVE TOOTH. QUESTIONNAIRE WAS FILLED AGAIN 2 WEEKS, 3 MONTHS, AND 6 MONTHS AFTER TREATMENT. ALL DATA WERE ANALYZED TO SEARCH THE CLEAR INDICATIONS FOR SINUS SURGICAL TREATMENT. RESULTS: OF 96 PATIENTS, 74 (77.1%) PATIENTS HAD FULL RESOLUTION OF SYMPTOMS AFTER DENTAL CAUSE WAS ELIMINATED. FOR OTHER 22 (22.9%) PATIENTS, SYMPTOMS PERSISTED AND SINUS SURGICAL TREATMENT WAS INDICATED. IN RECOVERED GROUP, MEAN SNOT-22 SCORE WAS DIFFERENT BETWEEN ALL PERIODS OF MEASURING, WHILE WITHIN NONRECOVERED GROUP, SMALL DIFFERENCES WERE SEEN ONLY WHEN COMPARED TO BEFORE TREATMENT. NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION BETWEEN RADIOLOGICAL CRITERIA AND RHINOSINUSITIS HEALING AFTER TOOTH EXTRACTION WAS FOUND (P > .05). STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF MALODOR/SNOT-22 SCORE REDUCTION AFTER ELIMINATION OF DENTAL CAUSE AND HEALING SUCCESS (P < .005). CONCLUSIONS: OUR STUDY REVEALED THAT EXTRACTION OF CAUSATIVE TOOTH IS AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC ODONTOGENIC RHINOSINUSITIS CAUSED BY APICAL PERIODONTITIS.

IN THIS STUDY WE SOUGHT TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF COMORBIDITIES ON SINONASAL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AND GENERAL HEALTH UTILITY VALUES BY UTILIZING THE FUNCTIONAL COMORBIDITY INDEX (FCI) IN CRS PATIENTS. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH CRS WERE PROSPECTIVELY ENROLLED IN A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY OF MEDICAL AND SURGICAL THERAPIES. THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AND MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY SHORT-FORM 6D (SF-6D) SCORES WERE RECORDED AT ENROLLMENT AND 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP; LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPY AND LUND-MACKAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SCORES WERE RECORDED AT ENROLLMENT. THE FCI WAS CALCULATED USING THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD. THE IMPACT OF CUMULATIVE COMORBIDITY BURDEN ON BASELINE AND POSTTREATMENT OUTCOMES WAS ASSESSED USING UNIVARIATE AND BIVARIATE CORRELATIONS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 428 PARTICIPANTS WITH CRS WERE INCLUDED. THE AVERAGE (MEAN STANDARD ± DEVIATION) FCI SCORE WAS 3.03 ± 2.28 (RANGE, 0-12). SIGNIFICANT LINEAR CORRELATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED BETWEEN INCREASING FCI SCORE AND BASELINE SNOT-22 AND SF-6D SCORES (R = 0.166, P = 0.001 AND R = -0.245, P < 0.001, RESPECTIVELY).

LIMITED RESEARCH EXAMINING CRS HEALTH DISPARITIES INDICATES THAT MINORITY STATUS IS ASSOCIATED WITH WORSE CRS. HOWEVER, MANY OF THESE STUDIES ARE RETROSPECTIVE OR PERFORMED IN POPULATIONS WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL ETHNIC MINORITIES. RHINOLOGISTS NEED TO CHARACTERIZE EXISTING CRS DISEASE DISPARITIES TO DEVELOP TARGETED STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING CARE IN THESE POPULATIONS. THIS PROSPECTIVE STUDY ASSESSES PREOPERATIVE CRS DISEASE BURDEN IN SOUTH FLORIDA (SFL) HISPANIC AND NON-HISPANIC PATIENTS AND EXAMINES POTENTIAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTING CRS DISEASE DISPARITIES. STUDY DESIGN: PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. METHODS: THE PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY INCLUDED CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS HAVING PRIMARY ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS) FOR CRS BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 2019 AND FEBRUARY 2020 WITH COMPLETE PREOPERATIVE DATA. DATA WERE COLLECTED IN CLINIC AND SURGERY. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS COMPARE HISPANIC AND NON-HISPANIC COHORTS. LINEAR REGRESSION ADJUSTS FOR CONFOUNDERS. RELATIVE RISK (RR) COMPARED CRS SEVERITY MARKERS. RESULTS: THIRTY-EIGHT HISPANIC AND 56 NON-HISPANIC PATIENTS MET INCLUSION CRITERIA. AGE, SEX, CT SCORES, INSURANCE PAYER, AND COMORBIDITIES WERE SIMILAR BETWEEN COHORTS. HISPANICS PRESENTED WITH WORSE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) (55; SD = 18) COMPARED TO NON-HISPANICS (37; SD = 22) (P < .001). HISPANICS TENDED TO HAVE A HIGHER RISK OF SEVERE CRS MARKERS, INCLUDING NASAL POLYPS RR = 2.5 (95% CI: 1.0-5.9), NEO-OSTEOGENESIS RR = 1.6 (95% CI: 0.5-4.7), EXTENDED PROCEDURES (I.E., DRAFT III) RR = 2.97 (95% CI: 1.0-9.1), AND TISSUE EOSINOPHILIA RR = 1.46 (95% CI: 0.6-3.5). HISPANICS REPORTED LONGER SINONASAL SYMPTOM DURATION. CONCLUSIONS: SFL HISPANIC PATIENTS PRESENTING FOR PRIMARY ESS HAVE WORSE SINONASAL DISEASE BURDEN. SFL HISPANICS HAVE MARKERS OF GREATER CRS SEVERITY AND REPORT LONGER DELAYS BEFORE RECEIVING CRS CARE. THESE FACTORS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASED SINONASAL DISEASE BURDEN IN HISPANIC PATIENTS.

THIS STUDY AIMS TO ESTIMATE THE PREVALENCE OF AND ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN (I) GENERAL ILLNESS FACTORS (FATIGUE, AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION) AND (II) PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS (ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, SOMATISATION, PERSONALITY TRAITS) IN PATIENTS PRESENTING WITH SINONASAL SYMPTOMS. DESIGN: THE FOLLOWING VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRES WERE ADMINISTERED TO PATIENTS: THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22) IDENTIFYING SYMPTOM BURDEN, COMPOSITE AUTONOMIC SYMPTOM SCORE-31 (COMPASS-31) MEASURING AUTONOMIC FUNCTION, CHALDER FATIGUE QUESTIONNAIRE, PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE-15 (PHQ-15) ADDRESSING SOMATISATION SYMPTOMS, HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS), AND THE INTERNATIONAL PERSONALITY ITEM POOL-50 (IPIP-50). COMPARISONS WERE MADE WITH NORMATIVE AND GENERAL POPULATION DATA, AND RELATIONSHIPS WERE ANALYSED USING NONPARAMETRIC CORRELATION. SETTING: SECONDARY CARE ENT OUTPATIENTS. PARTICIPANTS: ADULTS REFERRED WITH CHRONIC SINONASAL SYMPTOMS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: SNOT-22, COMPASS-31, CHALDER, PHQ-15, HADS, AND IPIP-50 QUESTIONNAIRE SCORES. RESULTS: SIXTY-ONE PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED. THERE WAS A HIGH PREVALENCE OF ALL GENERAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS ASSESSED COMPARED WITH CONTROLS. TOTAL SNOT-22 SCORES SHOWED SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION WITH CHALDER FATIGUE SCORES, TOTAL AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION SCORE, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, SOMATISATION TENDENCIES AND THE EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE PERSONALITY TRAIT. EMOTIONAL INSTABILITY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DYSFUNCTION CORRELATED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH SLEEP AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SUBSCALES OF SNOT-22 BUT NOT THE RHINOLOGICAL OR EAR/FACIAL SUBSCALES. CONCLUSION: PATIENTS WITH SINONASAL SYMPTOMS DEMONSTRATE HIGH PREVALENCE AND COMPLEX ASSOCIATIONS OF GENERAL ILLNESS FACTORS, PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND CERTAIN PERSONALITY TRAITS. THE SNOT-22 IS A VALUABLE TOOL, BUT ITS UTILITY IS LIMITED BY CORRELATIONS WITH THESE CONFOUNDING FACTORS (EG PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS) THAT MAY EXAGGERATE THE TOTAL SCORE.

HEREIN WE DETERMINE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HYPOSMIA IN CRS IN THE CONTEXT OF NASAL OBSTRUCTION AND DRAINAGE SYMPTOMS. STUDY DESIGN: PROSPECTIVE, CROSS-SECTIONAL METHODS: CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY OF 308 CRS PATIENTS (102 CRSWNP, 206 CRSSNP) WITHOUT PRIOR ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY. THE BURDEN OF NASAL OBSTRUCTION AND HYPOSMIA WERE ASSESSED USING THE CORRESPONDING ITEM SCORES ON THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). BURDEN OF NASAL DISCHARGE WAS ASSESSED USING THE MEAN OF \"THICK NASAL DISCHARGE\" AND \"THICK POST-NASAL DISCHARGE\" SNOT-22 ITEM SCORES. PATIENTS WERE ALL ASKED TO RATE THEIR CRS SYMPTOM CONTROL AS \"NOT AT ALL,\" \"A LITTLE,\" \"SOMEWHAT,\" \"VERY,\" OR \"COMPLETELY.\" RESULTS: IN CRSWNP, ONLY 4.9% HAD A HYPOSMIA SCORE > 1 WITH NASAL OBSTRUCTION AND DRAINAGE SCORES LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 1. IN CRSSNP, ONLY 1.9% HAD A HYPOSMIA SCORE > 1 WITH NASAL OBSTRUCTION AND DRAINAGE SCORES LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 1. ON UNIVARIATE ASSOCIATION, CRS SYMPTOM CONTROL WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH NASAL OBSTRUCTION, HYPOSMIA, AND DRAINAGE IN BOTH CRSWNP AND CRSSNP (P < .05 IN ALL CASES). USING MULTIVARIABLE REGRESSION TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL NASAL SYMPTOMS, ONLY NASAL OBSTRUCTION AND NASAL DISCHARGE SCORES (BUT NOT HYPOSMIA) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH CRS SYMPTOM CONTROL. CONCLUSIONS: HYPOSMIA RARELY OCCURS WITHOUT NASAL OBSTRUCTION OR NASAL DRAINAGE, AND MAY THEREFORE BE REDUNDANT TO ASSESS FOR CRS DISEASE CONTROL.

THE FUNCTIONAL COMORBIDITY INDEX (FCI) IS DESIGNED TO ELUCIDATE THE ROLE OF COMORBIDITIES ON FUNCTIONAL PROGNOSIS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF COMORBIDITIES KNOWN TO IMPACT PHYSICAL FUNCTION ON BASELINE HRQOL USING THE FCI.METHODOLOGY: PATIENTS MEETING DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR CRS WERE PROSPECTIVELY ENROLLED IN A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY. RESPONSES FROM THE SINONASAL OUTCOMES TEST-22 (SNOT-22), A MEASURE OF PATIENT HRQOL, AS WELL AS THE LUND-KENNEDY AND LUND-MACKAY SCORES WERE RECORDED AT ENROLLMENT. FCI WAS CALCULATED RETROSPECTIVELY USING THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD. INFORMATION WAS COLLECTED AND COMPARED FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT (CRSSNP) AND WITH NASAL POLYPS (CRSWNP) USING CHI-SQUARE AND T-TESTS. SPEARMAN'S CORRELATIONS, FOLLOWED BY MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION ANALYSIS, WERE USED TO ASSESS THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FCI AND SNOT-22 SCORES. RESULTS: ONE HUNDRED AND THREE PATIENTS MET INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ANALYSIS. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN AGE, GENDER, AND SNOT-22 SCORES BETWEEN PATIENTS WITH CRSSNP AND THOSE WITH CRSWNP. FCI WAS SIGNIFICANTLY AND INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH WORSE SNOT-22 SCORES (P = .012). FCI DID NOT CORRELATE WITH ENDOSCOPY AND COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SCORES. THE MEAN FCI FOR PATIENTS WITH CRSSNP AND CRSWNP WAS 2.02 AND 2.24, RESPECTIVELY, AND DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN THE TWO COHORTS (P = .565).

WE ESTIMATED ANCHOR-BASED THRESHOLDS FOR CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL CHANGE IN OBJECTIVE AND PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP USING DATA FROM LIBERTY NP SINUS-24 AND SINUS-52 TRIALS (NCT02912468; NCT02898454). METHODS: TARGET PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES WERE NC, LOS, AND TSS; TARGET OBJECTIVE OUTCOMES WERE UPSIT, NPS, AND CT-LMK. ANCHOR MEASURES WERE THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) RHINOLOGIC SYMPTOMS DOMAIN AND TOTAL SCORE AND RHINOSINUSITIS VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS). THE APPROPRIATENESS OF EACH ANCHOR MEASURE WAS EVALUATED BY REVIEWING CORRELATIONS BETWEEN CHANGE IN ANCHOR MEASURES AND TARGET OUTCOMES AND DESCRIPTIVE SCORES ON TARGET OUTCOMES BY LEVELS OF CHANGE IN THE ANCHOR MEASURE. ESTABLISHED THRESHOLDS FOR ANCHOR MEASURES (3.8 POINTS FOR SNOT-22 RHINOLOGIC SYMPTOMS, 8.9 POINTS FOR SNOT-22 TOTAL, 1-CATEGORY IMPROVEMENT FOR RHINOSINUSITIS VAS) WERE USED TO ESTIMATE CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL SCORE CHANGES FOR EACH TARGET OUTCOME. RESULTS: BASED ON CORRELATIONS BETWEEN CHANGE IN ANCHOR MEASURES AND TARGET OUTCOMES, SNOT-22 RHINOLOGIC SYMPTOMS DOMAIN WAS DEEMED THE MOST APPROPRIATE ANCHOR MEASURE.

THE AIM OF THIS CONTROLLED STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE IMMEDIATE AND LONG-TERM OUTCOMES FROM A SHORT COURSE OF A COMMONLY USED ORAL CORTICOSTEROID, PREDNISOLONE, IN WELL-DEFINED CRSSNP PATIENTS. STUDY DESIGN: PROSPECTIVE, OBSERVATIONAL CONTROLLED STUDY. METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE-CONTROLLED STUDY OF CRSSNP PATIENTS TREATED WITH PREDNISOLONE AT 0.5 MG/KG TAPERED OVER 10 DAYS AND NON-PREDNISOLONE TREATED CRSSNP PATIENTS (CONTROLS) AND FOLLOW-UP AT 2, 6, AND 12 MONTHS. BASELINE AND FOLLOW-UP SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT)-22, NASAL ENDOSCOPY (LUND-KENNEDY), AND SINUS CT SCAN SCORES (LUND-MACKAY) WERE COMPARED. RESULTS: AT 2 MONTHS, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE SNOT-22, NASAL ENDOSCOPY, AND SINUS CT SCAN SCORES IN THE PREDNISOLONE GROUP (P < .0001) COMPARED WITH CONTROLS (P = NS, MANN-WHITNEY U TEST). 52.5% OF PREDNISOLONE-TREATED CRSSNP PATIENTS HAD IMPROVED SYMPTOMS AND DID NOT REQUIRE SINUS SURGERY AT 12 MONTHS COMPARED WITH 14.3% OF CONTROLS (P < .001). SIDE-EFFECTS WERE REPORTED IN 8.9% OF PREDNISOLONE-TREATED PATIENTS. PATIENTS WHO BENEFITED FROM PREDNISOLONE HAD A MEDIAN SYMPTOM DURATION OF 7.25 (99% CONFIDENCE, UPPER LIMIT OF 11) MONTHS COMPARED WITH 18 MONTHS IN THOSE REQUIRING SURGERY. CONCLUSIONS: SHORT-TERM ORAL PREDNISOLONE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED ALL THREE CLINICAL MEASURES OF DISEASE IN CRSSNP PATIENTS AND AVOIDED SURGICAL INTERVENTION IN 52.5% PATIENTS IN THE FIRST 12 MONTHS. PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMS FOR LESS THAN 11 MONTHS WERE MOST LIKELY TO BENEFIT.

HOWEVER, THERE HAVE BEEN FEW STUDIES QUANTIFYING THE PRESENCE OF ETD IN CRS PATIENTS. WE SOUGHT TO DETERMINE THE PREVALENCE OF ETD SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (FESS) FOR CRS USING THE VALIDATED 7-ITEM EUSTACHIAN TUBE DYSFUNCTION QUESTIONNAIRE (ETDQ-7) AND TO CORRELATE THE ETDQ-7 SCORES WITH SCORES OF CRS SYMPTOM SEVERITY BASED ON THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). METHODS: PATIENTS FOR FESS WERE PREOPERATIVELY ADMINISTERED BOTH THE ETDQ-7 AND THE SNOT-22 VALIDATED QUALITY OF LIFE INSTRUMENTS. PEARSON AND SPEARMAN CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS WERE CALCULATED. CHANGES IN ETDQ-7 WERE MEASURED AT 3 MONTHS AND DIFFERENCES WERE COMPARED VIA PAIRED T TEST. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 82 PATIENTS COMPLETED THE SURVEYS. THIRTY-NINE (47.6%) PATIENTS HAD ETDQ-7 SCORE =14.5, SIGNIFYING CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT ETD SYMPTOMS. THE MEAN ETDQ-7 SCORE OF THE STUDY POPULATION WAS 15.8 ± 8.8, AND THE MEAN SNOT-22 SCORE WAS 37.5 ± 19.7. THE PEARSON AND SPEARMAN CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS BETWEEN ETDQ-7 AND THE TOTAL SNOT-22 SCORE WERE 0.52 (P > .0001) AND 0.51 (P < .0001), RESPECTIVELY. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ETDQ-7 SCORES POSTOPERATIVELY. CONCLUSION: WHILE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN ETD AND CRS HAS LONG BEEN KNOWN, THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW PROSPECTIVE PATIENT STUDIES EVALUATING OTOLOGIC SYMPTOMS IN A CRS POPULATION. WE FOUND THAT A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF CRS PATIENTS SUFFER FROM ETD SYMPTOMS BASED ON PATIENT-REPORTED SUBJECTIVE OUTCOME MEASURES.

OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR RECURRENT ACUTE RHINOSINUSITIS (RARS). STUDY DESIGN: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. METHODS: COCHRANE, PUBMED (MEDLINE), CLINICALTRIALS.GOV, EMBASE, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, AND WEB OF SCIENCE DATABASES WERE QUERIED FOR ARTICLES RELATED TO RARS DATING FROM 1990 TO PRESENT, ACCORDING TO PRISMA STATEMENT GUIDELINES. FULL TEXT ARTICLES PERTINENT TO THE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA OF RARS WERE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. INCLUSION CRITERIA INCLUDED ARTICLES SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING RARS; STUDIES WITH 3 OR MORE PATIENTS; AND ARTICLES IN ENGLISH. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 1022 TITLES/ABSTRACTS POTENTIALLY RELATED TO RARS WERE IDENTIFIED. OF THESE, SIXTY-NINE FULL TEXTS WERE SELECTED FOR REVIEW, AND 22 OF THESE ULTIMATELY MET INCLUSION CRITERIA. THE LEVEL OF EVIDENCE WAS GENERALLY LOW. STUDIES AND GUIDELINES HAVE USED MANY DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS FOR RARS DIAGNOSIS OVER THE YEARS BASED ON SYMPTOMATOLOGY, PHYSICAL EXAMINATION, NASAL ENDOSCOPY, IMAGING, AND LABORATORY DOMAINS. CLINICALLY IMPORTANT RARS HAS BEEN DEFINED MOST COMMONLY AS 4 OR MORE DISCRETE EPISODES OF ARS PER YEAR, BUT THIS FREQUENCY IS TYPICALLY BASED ON EXPERT OPINION. ADDITIONALLY, RADIOLOGIC ANATOMIC ASSOCIATIONS SUCH AS CONCHA BULLOSA, ACCESSORY MAXILLARY OS, AND NARROWED INFUNDIBULAR DISTANCE MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH RARS. ENDOSCOPIC VISUALIZATION AND IMAGING ARE SOMETIMES USED TO CONFIRM THE PRESENCE OF SINUS DISEASE DURING EXACERBATIONS OF RARS, BUT THERE IS VARIABILITY IN THIS PRACTICE. CONCLUSION: THE DIAGNOSTIC DEFINITION FOR RARS HAS DEVELOPED OVER TIME AND IS CURRENTLY BASED ON LOW LEVEL 4 AND 5 EVIDENCE. BECAUSE OF THE MIGRATORY DEFINITION OF RARS, COMPARING INTER-STUDY RESULTS OF RARS MANAGEMENT REMAINS DIFFICULT, AND FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD AIM TO FOLLOW CURRENT EXPERT GUIDELINES ON DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA OF RARS.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, INDIANA UNIVERSITY HEALTH, INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA.; INDIANA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA.; COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY, LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY, LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY.; COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY, LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, INDIANA UNIVERSITY HEALTH, INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA.; INDIANA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE, LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.; KENTUCKIANA EAR, NOSE & THROAT, LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.;","ORCID: 0000-0002-0410-3010",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020/09/21 08:40","20210818","20200920",2021,"2020/09/22 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,"1945-8932 (ELECTRONIC) 1945-8932 (LINKING)","101490775","AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RHINOLOGY & ALLERGY","ENG","10.1177/1945892420956871 [DOI]","20210818","2021/08/19 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","383-390","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"32954839","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"AM J RHINOL ALLERGY. 2021 MAY;35(3):383-390.

OBJECTIVE: WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT MICRO-GEOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES IN FUNGAL EXPOSURE CONTRIBUTE TO THE PATHOGENESIS OF AFRS, AND COMPARED HOME FUNGAL EXPOSURE OF PATIENTS WITH AFRS TO NORMATIVE DATA AND CONTROLS. METHODS: COMPREHENSIVE PROSPECTIVE ENROLLMENT AND DATA CAPTURE WAS COMPLETED IN 70 PATIENTS. PATIENTS WITH AFRS WERE COMPARED TO A CONTROL POPULATION WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITH NASAL POLYPOSIS (CRSWNP) AND COMORBID ATOPY. COMPREHENSIVE DEMOGRAPHICS, 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOMES TEST (SNOT-22) QUESTIONNAIRES, AND ENDOSCOPY SCORES WERE COMPILED. USING A TEST STRIP COLLECTION SYSTEM, A HOME FUNGAL ASSESSMENT WAS COMPLETED FOR EACH PATIENT, ALONG WITH DETAILED QUESTIONS RELATED TO HOME CONDITION. RESULTS: PATIENTS WITH AFRS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE YOUNGER (P<.001), AFRICAN AMERICAN (P<.001), FROM A LOWER INCOME BRACKET (P < .012), AND LESS LIKELY TO OWN THEIR HOME (P < .001). THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES IN PRIOR SURGERIES (P=.432), ENDOSCOPY SCORES (P = .409) OR SNOT-22 SCORES (P = .110) BETWEEN THE GROUPS. THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES IN OVERALL FUNGAL COUNTS BETWEEN PATIENTS WITH AFRS AND CONTROLS (P = .981). AFRS PATIENTS HAD A HIGHER PREVALENCE OF BASIDIOSPORES THAN CONTROLS (P = .034). CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY FAILED TO DETECT DIFFERENCES IN TOTAL HOME FUNGAL EXPOSURE LEVELS BETWEEN THOSE WITH AFRS AND ATOPIC CRSWNP, DESPITE DIFFERENCES IN SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. THIS SUGGESTS THAT ABSOLUTE FUNGAL LEVELS MAY NOT BE THE PRIMARY DRIVER IN DEVELOPMENT OF AFRS, OR THAT THE FUNGAL DETECTION STRATEGIES UTILIZED WERE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF PATIENTS' OVERALL FUNGAL EXPOSURE.","DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND SINUS SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, BALTIMORE, MARYLAND.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND SINUS SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND SINUS SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA.; DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, RALPH H.; JOHNSON VA MEDICAL CENTER, CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND SINUS SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA.;","ORCID: 0000-0003-1296-2648",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020/06/17 06:00","20210818","20200615",2020,"2020/06/17 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"6",NA,"1945-8932 (ELECTRONIC) 1945-8932 (LINKING)","101490775","AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RHINOLOGY & ALLERGY","ENG","10.1177/1945892420930953 [DOI]","20210818","2021/08/19 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","784-791","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"32539434","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"AM J RHINOL ALLERGY. 2020 NOV;34(6):784-791.

HOWEVER, IT IS UNCLEAR WHICH SYMPTOM DOMAINS CONTRIBUTE PRIMARILY TO PRODUCTIVITY LOSS. THIS INVESTIGATION SOUGHT TO ASSESS THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN CRS-SPECIFIC QOL SUBDOMAIN IMPAIRMENT AND PRODUCTIVITY LOSS. STUDY DESIGN: PROSPECTIVE, MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL, OBSERVATIONAL COHORT STUDY. METHODS: THERE WERE 198 PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY CRS ENROLLED BETWEEN AUGUST 2012 AND JUNE 2015. BASELINE QOL MEASURES WERE OBTAINED ACROSS FIVE SUBDOMAINS OF THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). LOST PRODUCTIVITY TIME WAS DETERMINED FROM PATIENT-REPORTED MEASURES OF ANNUAL ABSENTEEISM, PRESENTEEISM, AND LOST LEISURE TIME, AND THEN MONETIZED USING ANNUAL DAILY WAGE RATES FROM THE 2012 US NATIONAL CENSUS AND 2013 DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STATISTICS. RESULTS: PRODUCTIVITY LOSSES CORRELATED WITH IMPAIRMENTS IN BOTH SNOT-22 PSYCHOLOGICAL DYSFUNCTION (SPEARMAN CORRELATION COEFFICIENT [RS] = 0.428, P < .001), AND SLEEP DYSFUNCTION DOMAIN SCORES (RS = 0.355, P < .001). HIGHER SNOT-22 TOTAL SCORES ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH INCREASED MONETIZED PRODUCTIVITY LOSSES (RS = 0.366, P < .001). THE MEAN ANNUAL PRODUCTIVITY COST WAS $11,820/PATIENT, WHEREAS PATIENTS WITH COMORBID IMMUNODEFICIENCY ($23,285/PATIENT), TOBACCO USE ($23,195/PATIENT), AND STEROID DEPENDENCY ($18,910/PATIENT) REPORTED HIGHER THAN AVERAGE ANNUAL PRODUCTIVITY COSTS. MULTIVARIATE LINEAR REGRESSION FOUND MAXIMUM ANNUAL PRODUCTIVITY COSTS IN ADJUSTED PSYCHOLOGICAL ($13,300/PATIENT, P < .001) AND SLEEP DYSFUNCTION ($9,275/PATIENT, P < .001) DOMAINS. CONCLUSIONS: IMPAIRMENTS IN SLEEP AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SNOT-22 DOMAINS CORRELATE WITH PRODUCTIVITY LOSSES. PATIENTS WITH COMORBID IMMUNODEFICIENCY, SMOKING, AND STEROID DEPENDENCY HAD HIGHER THAN AVERAGE PRODUCTIVITY LOSSES. TARGETED MANAGEMENT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SLEEP DYSFUNCTION IN COMBINATION WITH STANDARD SYMPTOM CONTROL MAY IMPROVE PATIENT-CENTERED CARE AND REDUCE THE ANNUAL ECONOMIC BURDEN OF CRS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY WAS PERFORMED, INCLUDING PATIENTS WITH NASAL OBSTRUCTION WITH INV INVOLVEMENT. TO QUANTIFY AND COMPARE THE AMOUNT OF NASAL OBSTRUCTION, GERTNER METAL PLATE (GMP) WAS USED, AND TO ASSESS THE RELIEF IN ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS, THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) WAS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. GMP AND SNOT 22 WERE PERFORMED PREOPERATIVELY AND POSTOPERATIVELY AT THE 1(ST), 3(RD), AND 6(TH) MONTHS, AND THE DATA OBTAINED WERE ANALYZED BY SPSS 22 SOFTWARE USING PAIRED T-TESTS. THE POSTOPERATIVE BROADENING OF THE NASAL DORSUM AND PATIENT SATISFACTION WITH THE SURGICAL OUTCOME WERE ALSO ASSESSED USING THE VISUAL ANALOG SCALE . RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 38 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED, WITH 28 MALES AND 10 FEMALES. THE DATA OBTAINED WERE ANALYZED BY USING PAIRED T-TESTS.

HOWEVER, THE OPTIMAL IMPLANTATION SITE HAS NOT BEEN DEFINED. THIS STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE WHETHER LATERAL NASAL WALL IMPLANTATION IS SUPERIOR TO INFERIOR NASAL WALL IMPLANTATION IN TERMS OF CLINICAL BENEFITS AND IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY OF LIFE. STUDY DESIGN: RETROSPECTIVE STUDY IN A TERTIARY MEDICAL CENTER. METHODS: CONSECUTIVE ENS PATIENTS BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015 WITH OPERATIVE HISTORIES OF INFERIOR TURBINECTOMIES AND INDICATED FOR SURGICAL IMPLANTATION WERE ENROLLED, WITH AT LEAST 1-YEAR FOLLOW-UP. PATIENTS WERE DIVIDED INTO LATERAL AND INFERIOR NASAL WALL GROUPS. SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT)-22, BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY (BDI)-II, AND BECK ANXIETY INVENTORY (BAI) WERE APPLIED BEFORE AND 1 YEAR AFTER IMPLANTATION. RESULTS: OF THE TOTAL 30 ENS PATIENTS ANALYZED, 14 WERE IN THE INFERIOR NASAL WALL GROUP AND 16 WERE IN THE LATERAL NASAL WALL GROUP. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT INTERGROUP DIFFERENCES IN DEMOGRAPHIC DATA AND PREOPERATIVE SNOT-22, BDI-II, AND BAI SCORES. POSTOPERATIVE ASSESSMENT REVEALED THAT THE LATERAL NASAL WALL GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER SNOT-22 SCORE IMPROVEMENTS THAN THE INFERIOR NASAL WALL GROUP, PARTICULARLY REGARDING RHINOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS AND SLEEP FUNCTION. CONCLUSION: LATERAL NASAL WALL IMPLANTATION MAY PROVIDE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER CLINICAL OUTCOMES THAN INFERIOR NASAL WALL IMPLANTATION, AND THUS MAY BE THE PREFERRED, MORE OPTIMAL SITE FOR IMPLANT PLACEMENT IN ENS PATIENTS.

FREQUENCY AND TIMING OF POSTOPERATIVE CLINICAL VISITS IS DEBATED, BUT THE IMPACT OF ADHERENCE ON DISEASE-SPECIFIC OUTCOMES IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. IN THIS LONGITUDINAL STUDY, WE ASSESSED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FOLLOW-UP ADHERENCE AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OUTCOMES IN THE 12 MONTHS AFTER ESS. METHODS: A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF PATIENTS UNDERGOING AMBULATORY ESS FOR CRS BETWEEN 11/2016 AND 1/2018 WAS PERFORMED. WE ASSESSED SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, RADIOGRAPHIC SEVERITY, AND QOL UTILIZING THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). PATIENTS WERE CATEGORIZED AS \"NON-ADHERENT,\" \"MODERATELY-ADHERENT,\" AND \"FULLY-ADHERENT\" TO A 1-, 3- AND 5-WEEK POSTOPERATIVE VISIT SCHEDULE. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 166 PATIENTS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. OF THESE, 55 (33.1%) WERE FULLY-ADHERENT, 105 (63.2%) WERE MODERATELY-ADHERENT, AND 6 (3.6%) WERE NON-ADHERENT WITHIN THE 6 WEEKS FOLLOWING ESS. IN THE IMMEDIATE POSTOPERATIVE PERIOD, FULLY-ADHERENT PATIENTS DEMONSTRATED WORSE QOL (SNOT-22: 31.2 ± 23.1 VS 27.5 ± 17.6, P = .047). THIS COHORT ALSO HAD GREATER PSYCHOLOGICAL DYSFUNCTION AT BASELINE AND 12-MONTHS (P < .05) AFTER ESS. EXTRA-NASAL SYMPTOM SCORES INCREASED AT A LOWER RATE IN THE FULLY-ADHERENT COHORT (0.12 VS 1.29 POINTS PER 6 MONTHS, P = .038), AS DID EAR/FACIAL SYMPTOMS (1.17 VS 3.05 POINTS PER 6 MONTHS, P = .044). CONCLUSION: DESPITE WORSE SYMPTOM SEVERITY IN THE IMMEDIATE POSTOPERATIVE PERIOD, PATIENTS WHO ARE MORE ADHERENT TO THE FOLLOW-UP SCHEDULE DEMONSTRATED SLOWER RETURN OF SYMPTOMS IN THE EXTRA-RHINOLOGICAL AND EAR-FACIAL DOMAINS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: TWO GROUPS WERE ANALYZED FOR THE STUDY. ONE GROUP HAD SURGERY WHICH INCLUDED THE IMPLANT, SEPTOPLASTY, AND INFERIOR TURBINATE SUBMUCOUS REDUCTION AND THE OTHER GROUP HAD A VARIETY OF FUNCTIONAL RHINOPLASTY TECHNIQUES FOR LATERAL WALL INSUFFICIENCY IN ADDITION TO SEPTOPLASTY AND INFERIOR TURBINATE SUBMUCOUS REDUCTION.

STUDY DESIGN: PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL COHORT STUDY. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH CRS WHO ELECTED ESS WERE PROSPECTIVELY ENROLLED INTO A MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL, OBSERVATIONAL COHORT STUDY. PATIENTS' WERE CATEGORIZED INTO 10 PREOPERATIVE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) GROUPS BASED ON 10-POINT INCREMENTS BEGINNING WITH A SCORE OF 10 AND ENDING AT 110. THE PROPORTION OF PATIENTS ACHIEVING A SNOT-22 MINIMAL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE (MCID) (9 POINTS) AND THE PERCENTAGE OF RELATIVE IMPROVEMENT (%) FOR EACH PREOPERATIVE SNOT-22 GROUP WERE CALCULATED. A SUBGROUP ANALYSIS BASED ON POLYP STATUS WAS PERFORMED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 327 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY. PATIENTS WITH A SNOT-22 SCORE BETWEEN 10 AND 19 HAD THE LOWEST CHANCE OF ACHIEVING AN MCID (37.5%) AND RECEIVED A RELATIVE MEAN WORSENING OF THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AFTER ESS (+18.8%). PATIENTS WITH A SNOT-22 SCORE GREATER THAN 30 OBTAINED A GREATER THAN 75% CHANCE OF ACHIEVING AN MCID, AND THERE WAS A RELATIVE IMPROVEMENT OF 45% IN QOL (ALL < -44.9%) AFTER ESS. OUTCOMES FROM THE POLYP STATUS SUBGROUP ANALYSIS WERE SIMILAR TO THE FINDINGS FROM THE OVERALL COHORT. CONCLUSION: OUTCOMES FROM THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT PATIENTS WITH A PREOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORE HIGHER THAN 30 POINTS RECEIVE A GREATER THAN 75% CHANCE OF ACHIEVING AN MCID AND ON AVERAGE OBTAIN A 45% RELATIVE IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR QOL AFTER ESS.

THE EUROPEAN POSITION PAPER ON RHINOSINUSITIS (EPOS) PROVIDES WIDELY ACCEPTED DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA, WHICH INCLUDE SINONASAL SYMPTOMS, THEIR DURATION, AND IMAGING RESULTS. OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO COMPARE THESE APPROACHES TO ASSESSING SYMPTOMS TO DETERMINE IF EITHER WAS MORE INDICATIVE OF RADIOLOGIC FINDINGS, TO SUPPORT DECISIONS IN TELEHEALTH. STUDY DESIGN: OBSERVATIONAL OUTCOMES STUDY. SETTING: TERTIARY CARE CENTER. METHODS: IN TOTAL, 162 CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS PROVIDED A STRUCTURED SINONASAL HISTORY, COMPLETED THE SNOT-22, AND UNDERWENT SINUS COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) WITHIN 1 MONTH. SNOT-22 SCORES, EPOS-DEFINED SYMPTOM SETS, AND LUND-MACKAY RESULTS WERE ASSESSED. TO FACILITATE DIRECT COMPARISONS, WE PERFORMED STEPWISE EVALUATIONS OF SINONASAL SYMPTOMS ALONE AND COMBINED WITH DURATION. THE DISCRIMINATORY CAPACITY FOR IMAGING RESULTS WAS DETERMINED THROUGH AREAS UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVES (ROC-AUC) FOR DICHOTOMOUS OUTCOMES AND ORDINAL REGRESSION FOR MULTILEVEL OUTCOMES. RESULTS: IN ROC-AUC ANALYSES, SNOT-22 AND EPOS-DEFINED SYMPTOMS HAD SIMILAR DISCRIMINATORY CAPACITY FOR LUND-MACKAY SCORES, REGARDLESS OF DURATION. WITHIN ORDINAL REGRESSION ANALYSES, SNOT-22 NASAL SCORES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH LUND-MACKAY SCORES, WHILE EPOS-DEFINED NASAL SYMPTOMS WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED. CONCLUSIONS: SNOT-22 NASAL SCORES AND EPOS-DEFINED NASAL SYMPTOMS MAY HAVE SIMILAR ASSOCIATIONS WITH IMAGING RESULTS WHEN ASSESSED VIA ROC-AUC, WHILE SNOT-22 MAY HAVE MORE ASSOCIATION WITHIN ORDINAL DATA.

HOWEVER, STUDIES QUANTIFYING THE PRESENCE OF VOICE DYSFUNCTION IN CRS PATIENTS OR THE EFFECTS OF FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (FESS) ARE SPARSE. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE VOICE-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING FESS FOR CRS USING THE VALIDATED VOICE RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE SURVEY (VRQL). WE CORRELATED THE PREOPERATIVE VRQL SCORES TO THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES, AND WE DETERMINED THE EFFECT OF FESS ON POSTOPERATIVE VRQL SCORES. METHODS: CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS UNDERGOING FESS WERE PREOPERATIVELY ADMINISTERED BOTH THE VRQL AND THE SNOT-22 SURVEYS. SPEARMAN (<U+03A1>) AND PEARSON (R) CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS WERE CALCULATED. THE VRQL WAS MAILED TO PATIENTS POSTOPERATIVELY BETWEEN 3 AND 6 MONTHS. THE PAIRED T-TEST WAS USED TO COMPARE PRE- AND POST-FESS SCORES. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 102 PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED, AND 81 PATIENTS COMPLETED THE TWO SURVEYS. A TOTAL OF 51 (62.9%) PATIENTS HAD RAW VRQL SCORE = 10, SIGNIFYING PRESENCE OF SIGNIFICANT VOCAL SYMPTOMS. THE MEAN ± STANDARD DEVIATION (SD) RAW VRQL SCORE OF THE ENTIRE STUDY POPULATION WAS 12.4 ± 4.6, AND THE MEAN SNOT-22 SCORE WAS 37.8 ± 19.2. THE SPEARMAN CORRELATION COEFFICIENT BETWEEN VRQL AND THE TOTAL SNOT-22 SCORE WAS 0.34 (P =.002), AND THE PEARSON CORRELATION COEFFICIENT WAS 0.36 (P = .001). BOTH CORRELATIONS WERE SIMILAR, DEMONSTRATING THAT INCREASING SEVERITY OF CRS SYMPTOMS CORRELATES WITH DECREASING VOICE-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). SEVENTY PATIENTS COMPLETED THE POSTOPERATIVE SURVEY FOR AN 86% RETENTION RATE. THIRTY-SIX OF THESE PATIENTS HAD ABNORMAL PREOPERATIVE VRQL SCORES, AND THESE PATIENTS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER FESS. THE MEAN PREOPERATIVE VERSUS POSTOPERATIVE RAW SCORES WERE 15.2 ± 5.6 VERSUS 12.5 ± 4.1, RESPECTIVELY (P = .003). CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THE INCREASING PRESENCE OF VOCAL COMPLAINTS WITH INCREASING SEVERITY OF CRS. IT ALSO DEMONSTRATES THAT VRQL SCORES IMPROVE AFTER FESS IN THOSE PATIENTS WITH PREOPERATIVE VOCAL COMPLAINTS.

THE MOST EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF CRSWNP HAS NOT BEEN ELUCIDATED. DOXYCYCLINE, WHICH HAS ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND ANTI-BACTERIAL PROPERTIES, HAS SHOWN DURABLE EFFECTS; HOWEVER, ITS EFFICACY IN COMBINATION WITH STANDARD THERAPY HAS NOT BEEN EXAMINED. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT ITS ADDITION TO THE STANDARD ANTI-INFLAMMATORY REGIMEN WOULD IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES. METHODS: WE PERFORMED A DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL AT A TERTIARY LEVEL INSTITUTION. PATIENTS WITH MODERATE OR SEVERE CRSWNP WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS, EACH RECEIVING A 20-DAY COURSE OF ORAL CORTICOSTEROIDS AND DOXYCYCLINE OR PLACEBO. THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), NASAL POLYP SCORES, AND VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS) SCORES WERE RECORDED AT THE INITIAL, 3-, 8- AND 12-WEEK VISITS. RESULTS: 49 PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED, 24 IN THE EXPERIMENTAL AND 25 IN THE PLACEBO GROUP WITH 3 MODERATE DISEASE PATIENTS IN EACH GROUP. THERE WERE 12 DROPOUTS IN THE TREATMENT GROUP AND 14 IN THE PLACEBO GROUP. THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR DROPOUT WERE SEVERE CRS AND ASTHMA EXACERBATIONS. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN SNOT-22 SCORES, NASAL POLYP SCORES, AND VAS SCORES BETWEEN THE TWO ARMS. CONCLUSIONS: NON-SURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP REMAINS CHALLENGING. OUR CONCLUSIONS ARE LIMITED GIVEN THE HIGH DROPOUT RATE AND THUS, LIMITED SAMPLE SIZE WITH INADEQUATE POWER. THIS STUDY IS IMPORTANT, HOWEVER, BECAUSE A HIGH DROPOUT RATE OF MOSTLY SEVERE DISEASE PATIENTS MAY ILLUSTRATE THAT THIS PATIENT POPULATION MAY NOT BE OPTIMALLY MANAGED WITH MEDICAL THERAPY ALONE.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: SARAH.;KIDWAI@MOUNTSINAI.;ORG.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.; DEPARTMENT OF POPULATION HEALTH AND POLICY, ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT © 2019.

STUDY DESIGN: PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. METHODS: SIX HUNDRED THIRTY-SIX PATIENTS WITH CRS WERE RECRUITED FROM 11 OTOLARYNGOLOGIC PRACTICES AND COMPLETED THE SINONASAL-SPECIFIC, 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22) AND GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED EUROQOL 5-DIMENSION (EQ-5D) QUESTIONNAIRES AT BASELINE AND 12 AND 24 MONTHS AFTER ESS. PATIENTS WERE GROUPED CHRONOLOGICALLY TO DETERMINE WHETHER AGE AT TIME OF ESS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH CLINICAL OUTCOMES. RESULTS: AGES RANGED FROM 18 TO 80 YEARS (MEAN ± STANDARD DEVIATION = 48.5 ± 14.4). IMPROVEMENT WAS OBSERVED IN POSTOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORES AT 12 AND 24 MONTHS FOR ALL DECADES OF LIFE. SIMILAR IMPROVEMENTS WERE OBSERVED FOR EQ-5D-BASED HEALTH UTILITY VALUE (HUV) SCORES IN ALL DECADES OF LIFE, EXCEPT FOR THE ELDEST COHORT (AGES 70-80, N = 33), WHO DID NOT EXCEED THE MINIMAL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE AT EITHER 12 OR 24 MONTHS FOLLOWING ESS. IN REGRESSION ANALYSIS, AGE WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH SINONASAL-SPECIFIC OUTCOMES (CHANGE IN SNOT-22 SCORES) AT 12 (P = .507) OR 24 MONTHS (P = .955). IN GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES, HOWEVER, AGE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGE IN EQ-5D-BASED HUV SCORES FROM BASELINE TO 12 MONTHS FOLLOWING ESS AFTER ADJUSTING FOR PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS, COMORBIDITIES, AND SURGICAL HISTORY (P = .049). CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT ESS FOR ADULT CRS SUFFERERS OFFERS IMPROVED QOL OUTCOMES THROUGH THE EIGHTH DECADE OF LIFE.

RESULTS: THE FEASIBILITY, RELIABILITY, VALIDITY, AND RESPONSIBILITY OF CHINESE VERSION OF SNOT-22 QUESTIONNAIRE ALL PASSED THE TEST. IT SHOWED THAT BY CHINESE VERSION OF SNOT-22 QUESTIONNAIRE THE MOST FIVE IMPORTANT ITEMS AFFECTING HEALTH STATUS WERE NASAL OBSTRUCTION, RUNNY NOSE, LOSS OF SMELL OR TASTE, DIZZINESS AND POST-NASAL DISCHARGE RESPECTIVELY. THE COEFFICIENT OF CORRELATION WAS 0. 233 BETWEEN THE SNOT-22 QUESTIONNAIRE AND THE LUND-MACKAY CT SCORE OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS.

HOWEVER, INDICATIONS FOR ESS ARE CONTINUING TO BE DEFINED AND MANY LOW SNOT-22 SCORING PATIENTS STILL UNDERGO ELECTIVE SURGERY FOR CRS AND OTHER BENIGN SINONASAL PATHOLOGIES. THE OUTCOMES FOR THESE PATIENTS HAVE NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY STUDIED. OBJECTIVES: WE SOUGHT TO EVALUATE SURGICAL INDICATIONS AND OUTCOMES FOR THOSE PATIENTS WITH LIMITED SYMPTOMS UNDERGOING ESS. METHODS: WE SCREENED 2829 ESS PROCEDURES FROM 2010-2018 TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS WITH A PREOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORE <20. WE REVIEWED DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS, PREOPERATIVE LUND-MACKAY (LM) SCORES, AND PRE- AND POSTOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORES IN PATIENTS WITH AT LEAST 3 MONTHS' FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: OF ALL SURGICAL ESS PATIENTS SCREENED, 114 HAD LOW PREOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORES (4.0%). INDICATIONS FOR THESE SURGERIES INCLUDED CRS (50.0%), ODONTOGENIC SINUS DISEASE (11.4%), MUCOCELE (10.5%), RECURRENT ACUTE SINUSITIS (7.0%), FUNGAL BALL (5.3%), AND SILENT SINUS SYNDROME (4.4%). SPECIFICALLY, AMONG CRS PATIENTS, 45.6% HAD PULMONARY COMORBIDITIES AND/OR SYSTEMIC IMMUNODEFICIENCIES. MOREOVER, 100% OF CRS PATIENTS WITH NASAL POLYPS AND 73.1% OF CRS WITHOUT POLYPS HAD LM SCORES >5. PATIENTS WITH PREOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORES BETWEEN 15 AND 19 ACHIEVED AN AVERAGE 6.5 POINT REDUCTION (P < .001) POSTOPERATIVELY, WHEREAS THOSE WITH SCORES BETWEEN 10 AND 14 HAD A 5.4 POINT REDUCTION (P < .001), AND PREOPERATIVE SCORES <9 RESULTED IN NO SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN POSTOPERATIVE SYMPTOM SCORES (P = .98). OVERALL, THERE WAS A 3.3 POINT SNOT-22 REDUCTION AMONG ALL PATIENTS AT 3 MONTHS POSTOPERATIVELY (P < .001). CONCLUSION: PATIENTS WITH LIMITED SINONASAL SYMPTOMS MAY BENEFIT FROM SURGICAL TREATMENT DESPITE ASYMPTOMATIC CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS.

OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO COMPREHENSIVELY EXAMINE OBJECTIVE AND VALIDATED, DISEASE-SPECIFIC SUBJECTIVE SINONASAL AND PULMONARY OUTCOMES OF ASPIRIN (ASA) DESENSITIZATION THERAPY IN THIS PATIENT POPULATION. METHODS: PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY AT AN ACADEMIC TERTIARY CENTER. AERD PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITH NASAL POLYPOSIS (CRSWNP), PRIOR DIAGNOSIS OF ASTHMA, AND A HISTORY OF ASA SENSITIVITY WERE ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION. PATIENTS UNDERWENT ASA DESENSITIZATION USING AN ESTABLISHED INSTITUTIONAL PROTOCOL AND CONTINUED ON A 650MG TWICE DAILY MAINTENANCE DOSE. BASELINE SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AND ASTHMA CONTROL QUESTIONNAIRE (ACQ) RESPONSES, ACOUSTIC RHINOMETRY, PEAK FLOW READINGS, AND ENDOSCOPIC SCORING OF NASAL POLYPS WERE RECORDED PRIOR TO DESENSITIZATION AND AFTER 6MONTHS OF MAINTENANCE THERAPY. RESULTS: TWELVE PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED FOR PARTICIPATION AND UNDERWENT DESENSITIZATION. EIGHT PATIENTS CONTINUED MAINTENANCE THERAPY AND FOLLOW UP AT 6MONTHS. PRIOR TO DESENSITIZATION, PATIENTS REPORTED BOTHERSOME SINONASAL SYMPTOMS WITH A MEDIAN SNOT-22 SCORE OF 30.0±34.5 (INTERQUARTILE RANGE (IQR)). THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT AFTER 6MONTHS OF MAINTENANCE THERAPY TO A MEDIAN SNOT-22 SCORE OF 18.5±17.3 (P=0.025, WILCOXON SIGNED RANK TEST). ACOUSTIC RHINOMETRY, ENDOSCOPIC SCORES, ACQ AND FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME VALUES REMAINED STABLE AT 6MONTHS. CONCLUSIONS: AERD PATIENTS MAY BENEFIT FROM ASA DESENSITIZATION WITH SUBJECTIVE SINONASAL SYMPTOM IMPROVEMENT AT 6MONTHS AND STABLE ASTHMA AND OBJECTIVE SINONASAL MEASURES.

EOSINOPHILS PLAY A ROLE IN THE MAJORITY (85%) OF PATIENTS. BENRALIZUMAB, AN AFUCOSYLATED MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY DIRECTED AGAINST THE IL-5 RECEPTOR, HAS POWERFUL APOPTOTIC EFFECTS ON EOSINOPHILS. OBJECTIVE: WE SOUGHT TO INVESTIGATE THE THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT OF INHIBITING THE IL-5 RECEPTOR USING BENRALIZUMAB TO TREAT SEVERE RHINOSINUSITIS WITH NASAL POLYPS. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH SEVERE NP (DEFINED BY ENDOSCOPIC GRADE 5 OR MORE OUT OF 8) WITH ELEVATED EOSINOPHILS AND A HISTORY OF PREVIOUS SURGICAL OR ENDOSCOPIC POLYPECTOMY MET ENTRY CRITERIA AND WERE RANDOMIZED IN A DOUBLE-BLIND FASHION TO RECEIVE 30 MG BENRALIZUMAB SC OR PLACEBO.

HOWEVER, DISPARITIES AMONG PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS) ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. WE INVESTIGATED IF CRS SEVERITY AT PRESENTATION ACCORDING TO SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS. STUDY DESIGN CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY. SETTING TERTIARY RHINOLOGY CENTER. SUBJECTS AND METHODS THREE HUNDRED PROSPECTIVELY RECRUITED PATIENTS PRESENTING WITH CRS WERE INCLUDED. OUTCOME VARIABLES INCLUDED CRS SYMPTOMATOLOGY, AS REFLECTED BY THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22); GENERAL HEALTH STATUS, AS REFLECTED BY THE EUROQOL 5-DIMENSIONAL VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (EQ-5D VAS); AND CRS-RELATED ANTIBIOTIC AND SYSTEMIC CORTICOSTEROID USE. RACE/ETHNICITY, ZIP CODE INCOME BRACKET, EDUCATION LEVEL, AND INSURANCE STATUS WERE USED AS PREDICTOR VARIABLES. REGRESSION, CONTROLLING FOR CLINICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, WAS USED TO DETERMINE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PREDICTOR AND OUTCOME VARIABLES. RESULTS MEAN SNOT-22 SCORE WAS 33.8 (SD, 23.2), AND MEAN EQ-5D VAS SCORE WAS 74.2 (SD, 18.9). ON MULTIVARIABLE ANALYSIS, PRESENTING SNOT-22 AND EQ-5D VAS SCORES WERE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH NONWHITE PATIENT RACE/ETHNICITY ( P = .634 AND P = .866), EDUCATION ( P = .106 AND P = .586), OR THE PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEHOLDS IN ZIP CODE WITH INCOMES <$50,000 PER YEAR ( P = .917 AND P = .979, RESPECTIVELY). SNOT-22 SCORES DID NOT DIFFER BY INSURANCE TYPE, BUT PATIENTS RECEIVING MEDICARE REPORTED WORSE GENERAL HEALTH STATUS. USE OF ORAL ANTIBIOTICS OR ORAL STEROIDS FOR CRS WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH PREDICTOR VARIABLES. CONCLUSION PATIENTS WITH CRS PRESENTED TO A TERTIARY RHINOLOGY CENTER WITH SIMILAR METRICS FOR CRS SEVERITY AND PRE-PRESENTATION MEDICAL MANAGEMENT REGARDLESS OF RACE/ETHNICITY, EDUCATION STATUS, OR ZIP CODE INCOME LEVEL. PATIENTS WITH MEDICARE HAD WORSE GENERAL HEALTH STATUS.

METHODS: ADULT PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY CRS WERE PROSPECTIVELY ENROLLED INTO AN OBSERVATIONAL, MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL COHORT STUDY BETWEEN MARCH 2011 AND JUNE 2015. SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS ANALYZED INCLUDED HOUSEHOLD INCOME, INSURANCE STATUS, YEARS OF EDUCATION COMPLETED, RACE, AGE, AND ETHNICITY. INCOME WAS STRATIFIED ACCORDING TO THE THOMPSON AND HICKEY MODEL. THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AND BRIEF SMELL IDENTIFICATION TEST (BSIT) WERE COMPLETED PREOPERATIVELY AND POSTOPERATIVELY. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 392 PATIENTS MET INCLUSION CRITERIA.

UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIFFERENT TREATMENTS OF CRS IS VERY SIGNIFICANT IN SELECTING APPROPRIATE THERAPIES AND PREVENTING EXACERBATION RELEVANT TO THIS CHRONIC INFLAMMATION. THIS STUDY WAS AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF CHINESE TRADITIONAL MEDICINE LIANHUAQINGWEN GRANULES ON CRSSNP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CRSSNP PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED AND RANDOMIZED INTO PLACEBO OR LIANHUAQINGWEN (LHQW) GRANULES TREATMENT GROUP (PLACEBO OR LHQW GROUP). THEIR CLINICAL SYMPTOMS WERE SCORED USING VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS) AND SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT)-22. NITRIC OXIDE (NO) FROM NASAL CAVITY AND SINUS AND NASAL RESISTANCE WERE ALSO EXAMINED. THEN, NASAL BIOPSY SAMPLES AND NASAL LAVAGE FLUID (NLF) WERE OBTAINED FROM THESE PATIENTS, AND HISTOLOGIC CHARACTERISTICS OF NASAL MUCOSA AND T CELL SUBPOPULATIONS PATTERNS IN THE NLF WERE EVALUATED. FINALLY, INFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS IN THE NLF WERE ASSESSED IN BOTH GROUPS. RESULTS: ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY PATIENTS WITH CRSSNP FINISHED THIS ONE-MONTH STUDY. VAS AND SNOT-22 SCORES AND NASAL RESISTANCE WERE ALL DECREASED DISTINCTLY AFTER THE TREATMENT OF LHQW, BUT NOT AFTER PLACEBO. HOWEVER, THE NASAL NO CONCENTRATION WAS INCREASED IN LHQW ADMINISTRATION GROUP IN COMPARISON WITH PLACEBO GROUP. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN ABOVE PARAMETERS BETWEEN THESE TWO TREATMENTS. HISTOLOGIC CHANGES IN NASAL MUCOSA WERE IMPROVED ONLY IN LHQW GROUP. CD4(+) AND CD8(+) T CELLS WERE ALL DOWNREGULATED IN THE LHQW TREATMENT GROUP, BUT NOT IN PLACEBO GROUP. INFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS FROM THE NLF WERE DECREASED IN LHQW TREATMENT GROUP COMPARED TO PLACEBO GROUP. FURTHERMORE, THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUPS IN CD4(+) AND CD8(+) T CELL SUBPOPULATIONS AND CONCENTRATIONS OF INFLAMMATORY SUBSTANCES. CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THAT LHQW GRANULES TREATMENT MAY CONTROL THE INFLAMMATION IN NASAL MUCOSA AND RESULT IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF CRSSNP. THIS CHINESE MEDICINE MIGHT BECOME A PROMISING THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THIS DISEASE.","DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, HUASHAN HOSPITAL NORTH OF FUDAN UNIVERSITY, SHANGHAI, CHINA.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: LINLINHSN@ALIYUN.;COM.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, HUASHAN HOSPITAL NORTH OF FUDAN UNIVERSITY, SHANGHAI, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF PATHOLOGY, HUASHAN HOSPITAL NORTH OF FUDAN UNIVERSITY, SHANGHAI, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, HUASHAN HOSPITAL NORTH OF FUDAN UNIVERSITY, SHANGHAI, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, HUASHAN HOSPITAL NORTH OF FUDAN UNIVERSITY, SHANGHAI, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, HUASHAN HOSPITAL NORTH OF FUDAN UNIVERSITY, SHANGHAI, CHINA.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT © 2019 ELSEVIER INC.

OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY DEVELOPED AND EXAMINED THE INITIAL RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY OF THE CRS-PRO, A NEW PRO MEASURE OF CRS. METHODS: INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT WAS PERFORMED THROUGH STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS AND FOCUS GROUPS WITH CLINICAL EXPERTS AND 45 PATIENTS WITH CRS MEETING CURRENT DEFINITIONS OF DISEASE, 21 PATIENTS WITH CRS WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS (CRSSNP), AND 24 PATIENTS WITH CRS WITH NASAL POLYPS (CRSWNP) TO IDENTIFY ITEMS IMPORTANT TO PATIENTS. THEN ANOTHER 50 PATIENTS (32 WITH CRSSNP AND 18 WITH CRSWNP) WITH STABLE CRS SYMPTOMS WERE ENROLLED TO EVALUATE THE RELIABILITY OF THE INSTRUMENT. EACH PATIENT COMPLETED THE CRS-PRO, SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22), AND 4 PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME MEASUREMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM SHORT FORMS AT THE BASELINE VISIT AND THEN AT LEAST 7 DAYS LATER. RESULTS: AFTER THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, 21 ITEMS WERE IDENTIFIED FROM THE CONCEPTUAL DOMAINS OF PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS, SENSORY IMPAIRMENT, PSYCHOSOCIAL EFFECTS, AND LIFE IMPACT. USING THE RESPONSES OF THE 50 PATIENTS WITH CRS, 21 DRAFT ITEMS WERE FURTHER REFINED TO 12 ITEMS BY ELIMINATING CONCEPTUALLY SIMILAR OR HIGHLY CORRELATED ITEMS OR THOSE WITH LOW MEAN SYMPTOM SEVERITY. THE 12-ITEM QUESTIONNAIRE WAS SHOWN TO HAVE EXCELLENT INTERNAL CONSISTENCY (CRONBACH <U+0391>, 0.86) AND TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY WITH A HIGH INTRACLASS CORRELATION COEFFICIENT (0.89) AND PEARSON'S CORRELATION (R = 0.82, P < .0001).

STUDY DESIGN CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY. SETTING ACADEMIC TERTIARY CARE RHINOLOGY CLINIC. SUBJECTS AND METHODS A TOTAL OF 103 FORMER-SMOKER CRS PATIENTS AND 103 NONSMOKER CRS PATIENTS WERE PROSPECTIVELY RECRUITED. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS SINONASAL SYMPTOM SEVERITY MEASURED WITH THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOMES TEST (SNOT-22), AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES WERE GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) MEASURED WITH THE 5-DIMENSIONAL EUROQOL VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (EQ-5D VAS) AND PATIENT-REPORTED CRS-RELATED ANTIBIOTIC AND ORAL CORTICOSTEROID USAGE IN THE PAST YEAR. OUTCOME MEASURES WERE COMPARED BETWEEN COHORTS AND CHECKED FOR ASSOCIATION WITH TIME SINCE CESSATION OF SMOKING FOR FORMER SMOKERS. RESULTS COMPARED WITH NONSMOKERS, FORMER SMOKERS HAD WORSE SNOT-22 SCORE ( P = .019) AND EQ-5D VAS SCORE ( P = .001) AND REPORTED USING MORE CRS-RELATED ANTIBIOTICS ( P = .003) AND ORAL CORTICOSTEROIDS IN THE PAST YEAR ( P = .013).

THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENCES IN OUTCOMES BY AGE FOLLOWING ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS) FOR CRS UTILIZING 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES. METHODS: DATA FROM 1252 ADULT CRS PATIENTS ELECTING TO UNDERGO ESS (2007-2018) WERE COLLECTED RETROSPECTIVELY. THE MEDIAN AGE OF 50 YEARS WAS USED TO DIVIDE THE DATA INTO 2 GROUPS FOR COMPARISON OF THE IMPACT OF AGE ON SNOT-22 SCORES AT 0, 3, AND 6 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY. CHANGES IN SNOT-22 SCORES WERE ANALYZED USING A MIXED MODELS ANALYSIS. RESULTS: AFTER ADJUSTING FOR GENDER, RACE, POLYP STATUS, AND NUMBER OF PRIOR ESSS, PATIENTS YOUNGER THAN 50 YEARS HAD A HIGHER MEAN PRE-ESS SNOT-22 SCORE (44.0) COMPARED TO THOSE OF AT LEAST 50 YEARS OF AGE (38.9). AMONG PATIENTS YOUNGER THAN 50 YEARS, SNOT-22 SCORES DECLINED BY 20.7 POINTS AT 3 MONTHS POST-ESS AND 16.1 POINTS AT 6 MONTHS POST-ESS. THE RATE OF CHANGE BETWEEN THE DICHOTOMIZED AGE GROUPS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT AT 3 AND 6 MONTHS POST-ESS (P = 0.7952 AND P = 0.1057, RESPECTIVELY). CONCLUSION: BOTH AGE GROUPS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT AND DURABLE IMPROVEMENT IN SNOT-22 SCORES AFTER ESS. PATIENTS YOUNGER THAN 50 YEARS OF AGE HAVE HIGHER PRE-ESS SNOT-22 SCORES, BUT CONVERGE TO THE SAME SNOT-22 SCORES BY 3 MONTHS POST-ESS.

OBEJCTIVE: OUR AIM WAS TO COMPARE PATTERNS OF SYMPTOMS AND HRQL DISEASE-SPECIFIC DOMAINS IN PATIENTS AFFECTED WITH THESE 2 TYPES OF CRS. METHODS: A GROUP OF 201 PATIENTS WITH CRS (99 WITH RHINOGENIC AND 102 WITH ODONTOGENIC ORIGIN) COMPLETED THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST 22 (SNOT-22) QUESTIONNAIRE BEFORE TREATMENT. DATA SETS WERE ANALYZED BY USING PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA) TO IDENTIFY A SET OF SYMPTOM COMPONENTS TOGETHER WITH THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM PCA, WHICH WERE THEN ANALYZED FOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PATIENTS WITH OMS AND RS. RESULTS: PCA OF SNOT-22 ITEMS IDENTIFIED 5 COMPONENTS: \"RHINOLOGIC,\" \"EXTRANASAL RHINOLOGIC,\" \"EAR/FACIAL,\" \"SLEEP AND FUNCTIONAL DISTURBANCE,\" AND \"EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE.\" SNEEZING WAS EXCLUDED FROM PCA AND TREATED AS SEPARATE OUTCOME VARIABLE AND WAS SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE IN RS PATIENTS. PATIENTS WITH OMS SCORED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SCORES WITH REGARD TO EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE, WHILE RS PATIENTS SCORED SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE IN SLEEP AND FUNCTIONAL DISTURBANCE. THE EXTRA SYMPTOM \"MALODOR\" WAS THE MOST DIFFERENT SYMPTOM AND WAS SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE IN OMS PATIENTS. THE TOTAL SNOT-22 SCORE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE GROUPS. CONCLUSION: WITH CONTROLLING OF COVARIATES THAT MAY INFLUENCE THE SEVERITY OF THE DISEASE, THIS STUDY SHOWED SOME SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN SYMPTOM PATTERNS AND HRQL IMPAIRMENT BETWEEN PATIENTS WITH OMS AND RS. MALODOR IS THE MOST CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF OMS. THEREFORE, OMS SHOULD ALWAYS BE SUSPECTED IN PATIENTS COMPLAINING OF BAD BREATH.","1 DEPARTMENT OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY, LITHUANIAN UNIVERSITY OF HEALTH SCIENCES, KAUNAS, LITHUANIA.; 2 DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, LITHUANIAN UNIVERSITY OF HEALTH SCIENCES, KAUNAS, LITHUANIA.; 1 DEPARTMENT OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY, LITHUANIAN UNIVERSITY OF HEALTH SCIENCES, KAUNAS, LITHUANIA.; 2 DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, LITHUANIAN UNIVERSITY OF HEALTH SCIENCES, KAUNAS, LITHUANIA.; 1 DEPARTMENT OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY, LITHUANIAN UNIVERSITY OF HEALTH SCIENCES, KAUNAS, LITHUANIA.; 1 DEPARTMENT OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY, LITHUANIAN UNIVERSITY OF HEALTH SCIENCES, KAUNAS, LITHUANIA.; 2 DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, LITHUANIAN UNIVERSITY OF HEALTH SCIENCES, KAUNAS, LITHUANIA.; 3 FACULTY OF HEALTH SCIENCE, KLAIPEDA UNIVERSITY, KLAIPEDA, LITHUANIA.; 2 DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, LITHUANIAN UNIVERSITY OF HEALTH SCIENCES, KAUNAS, LITHUANIA.;","ORCID: 0000-0002-3020-8430",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018/10/13 06:00","20190624","20181012",2019,"2018/10/13 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"1",NA,"1945-8932 (ELECTRONIC) 1945-8932 (LINKING)","101490775","AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RHINOLOGY & ALLERGY","ENG","10.1177/1945892418804975 [DOI]","20190624","2019/06/25 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","44-50","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"30311505","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"AM J RHINOL ALLERGY. 2019 JAN;33(1):44-50.

RESULTS: FROM 1065 ASPIRIN-EXACERBATED RESPIRATORY DISEASE REGISTRY SUBJECTS (MEAN AGE, 48.1 ± 12.8 YEARS; 68.0% FEMALES, 29.8% MALES), MEAN SNOT-22 SCORE WAS 42.3 ± 24.12 (N = 1307 OBSERVATIONS FROM 869 SUBJECTS), MEAN ACT SCORE WAS 19.4 ± 5.2 (N = 1511 OBSERVATIONS FROM 931 SUBJECTS), AND MEAN FEV(1)% PREDICTED WAS 82.8 ± 19.6 (N = 777 OBSERVATIONS FROM 307 SUBJECTS). SNOT-22 SCORE SIGNIFICANTLY PREDICTED ACT SCORES (P < .0001, 1185 PAIRED OBSERVATIONS FROM 845 SUBJECTS) AND FEV(1)% PREDICTED (P = .018, 485 OBSERVATIONS FROM 246 SUBJECTS). ANY 10-POINT INCREASE IN SNOT-22 SCORE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A 0.87-POINT DECREASE IN ACT SCORE AND A 0.75% DECREASE IN FEV(1)% PREDICTED. ANY 1-POINT INCREASE IN ACT SCORE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A 1.0% INCREASE IN FEV(1)% PREDICTED (P < .0001, 616 OBSERVATIONS FROM 269 SUBJECTS). THE MOST SEVERE SNOT-22 SYMPTOMS WERE SENSE OF SMELL/TASTE AND BLOCKAGE/CONGESTION OF NOSE. CONCLUSIONS: SNOT-22 SCORES SIGNIFICANTLY PREDICT ACT SCORES AND FEV(1)% PREDICTED, AND ACT SCORES SIGNIFICANTLY PREDICT FEV(1)% PREDICTED. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PATIENT-REPORTED RHINOSINUSITIS AND ASTHMA SYMPTOM SEVERITY AND SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE MEASURES OF ASTHMA SEVERITY.","DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL, BOSTON, MASS; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASS; PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES, VALUE AND EXPERIENCE (PROVE) CENTER, BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL, BOSTON, MASS; CENTER FOR SURGERY AND PUBLIC HEALTH, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASS.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: RBERGMARK@BWH.;HARVARD.;EDU.; DIVISION OF RHEUMATOLOGY, IMMUNOLOGY, AND ALLERGY, BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL, BOSTON, MASS; HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASS.; CENTER FOR SURGERY AND PUBLIC HEALTH, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASS; CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, CLEVELAND, OHIO.; CENTER FOR CLINICAL INVESTIGATION, BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL, BOSTON, MASS.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL, BOSTON, MASS.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL, BOSTON, MASS; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASS.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL, BOSTON, MASS; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASS.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL, BOSTON, MASS; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASS.; DIVISION OF RHEUMATOLOGY, IMMUNOLOGY, AND ALLERGY, BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL, BOSTON, MASS; HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASS.; DIVISION OF RHEUMATOLOGY, IMMUNOLOGY, AND ALLERGY, BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL, BOSTON, MASS; HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASS.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT © 2021.

OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF ORAL CORTICOSTEROIDS FOLLOWING ESS IN CRS WITHOUT POLYPS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: THIS PROSPECTIVE DOUBLE-BLINDED, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, RANDOMIZED NONINFERIORITY CLINICAL TRIAL CONDUCTED IN A SINGLE ACADEMIC TERTIARY RHINOLOGY PRACTICE INCLUDED ADULTS WITH CRS WITHOUT POLYPS UNDERGOING ESS. OF 81 PATIENTS RECRUITED, 72 COMPLETED THE STUDY. INTERVENTIONS: PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO 2 TREATMENT GROUPS: A 12-DAY POSTOPERATIVE TAPER OF ORAL PREDNISONE VS MATCHED PLACEBO TABLETS. ALL STUDY PATIENTS ALSO RECEIVED A UNIFORM 2-WEEK POSTOPERATIVE REGIMEN OF ORAL ANTIBIOTICS, FLUTICASONE NASAL SPRAY, AND SALINE RINSES. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES WERE SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22) SCORES AND LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPY SCORES, COLLECTED PREOPERATIVELY AND POSTOPERATIVELY AT 1 WEEK, 1 MONTH, 3 MONTHS, AND 6 MONTHS. SCORES WERE COMPARED BETWEEN TREATMENT GROUPS AT EACH TIME POINT USING LONGITUDINAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TREATMENT GROUPS AND ANALYZED USING 2-WAY, REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE. SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED TREATMENT-RELATED ADVERSE EFFECTS. RESULTS: OVERALL, 72 PATIENTS (MEAN [SD] AGE, 49.4 [14.9] YEARS; 36 MEN, 36 WOMEN) COMPLETED THE STUDY, WITH 33 IN THE PREDNISONE ARM AND 39 IN THE PLACEBO ARM. WHEN COMPARING LONGITUDINAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TREATMENT GROUPS, THERE WAS NO CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE OBSERVED IN SNOT-22 TOTAL (F[4254] = 1.71, <U+0397>2 = 0.01 [95% CI, 0.00-0.05]) OR LUND-KENNEDY SCORES (F[4247] = 1.23, <U+0397>2 = 0.02 [95% CI, 0.00-0.50]). IN SNOT-22 SUBDOMAIN ANALYSES, THERE WAS NO CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TREATMENT GROUPS FOR RHINOLOGIC, EXTRANASAL RHINOLOGIC, EAR/FACIAL, OR SLEEP SUBDOMAINS. HOWEVER, THE PREDNISONE GROUP HAD WORSE LONGITUDINAL SCORES FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL DYSFUNCTION COMPARED WITH THE PLACEBO GROUP (F[4254] = 3.18, <U+0397>2 = 0.05 [95% CI, 0.02-0.09]). REPORTED ADVERSE EFFECTS WERE SIMILAR BETWEEN THE 2 TREATMENT GROUPS. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: IN THIS RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL OF PATIENTS WITH CRS WITHOUT POLYPS, ORAL PREDNISONE FOLLOWING ESS CONFERRED NO ADDITIONAL BENEFIT OVER PLACEBO IN TERMS OF SNOT-22 TOTAL SCORES, SNOT-22 RHINOLOGIC SUBSCORES, OR LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPY SCORES UP TO 6 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY. PATIENTS RECEIVING PREDNISONE, HOWEVER, DID DEMONSTRATE WORSE SNOT-22 PSYCHOLOGIC SUBDOMAIN SCORES. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE RISKS OF ORAL CORTICOSTEROIDS MAY OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS; THUS USE OF ORAL CORTICOSTEROIDS AFTER ESS FOR CRS WITHOUT POLYPS SHOULD BE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED.

METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE STUDY WAS PERFORMED IN CRS PATIENTS WITH ETD WHO UNDERWENT ESS FROM 3 TERTIARY MEDICAL CENTERS IN SOUTH CHINA. THE EUSTACHIAN TUBE DYSFUNCTION QUESTIONNAIRE 7 (ETDQ-7), SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST 22 (SNOT-22), TYMPANOGRAMS, ENDOSCOPIC FINDINGS AND VALSALVA MANEUVER WERE RECORDED AND ANALYZED PREOPERATIVELY AND POSTOPERATIVELY AT 8-12 WEEKS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 70 CRS PATIENTS WITH ETD WERE INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY. THE ETDQ-7 SCORE AND THE ABILITY OF POSITIVE VALSALVA MANEUVER IN CRS PATIENTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED POSTOPERATIVELY AT 8-12 WEEKS. THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS WITH TYPE A TYMPANOGRAM WAS INCREASED POSTOPERATIVELY. REDUCED EUSTACHIAN TUBE MUCOSAL INFLAMMATION WAS ALSO OBSERVED POSTOPERATIVELY. IN ADDITION, ESS APPEARED TO REVERSE SLIGHT TYMPANIC MEMBRANE ATELECTASIS AFTER 8-12 WEEKS.

INITIALLY, THE PNIF WAS MEASURED AND THE VISUAL ANALOGICAL SCALE (VAS) WAS USED FOR NASAL OBSTRUCTION, FOLLOWED BY THE NASAL ASPIRATION PROCEDURE. THE SNOT-22 QUESTIONNAIRE WAS APPLIED TO THE LEGAL GUARDIAN OF EACH CHILD, AND ONE WEEK LATER, IT WAS REAPPLIED FOR THE SAKE OF FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: 16 (53.3%) PATIENTS WERE FEMALES AND 14 (46.7%) WERE MALES, WITH AN AVERAGE AGE OF 6.4±1.8 YEARS (BETWEEN 4 AND 10 YEARS OF AGE). ANALYSES OF THE VAS FOR OBSTRUCTION BEFORE THE INTERVENTION REVEALED THAT 10 OF THE PARTICIPANTS (33.3%) PRESENTED MODERATE LEVELS, AND 20 OF THEM (66.7%) SEVERE LEVELS.

METHODS: AERD PATIENTS WERE REVIEWED AND DIVIDED INTO TWO COHORTS, DEPENDING IF THEY WERE TREATED WITH ZILEUTON DURING THEIR CLINICAL COURSE. DEMOGRAPHIC DATA, 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), LUND-KENNEDY (LK) ENDOSCOPY SCORE, DURATION OF TREATMENT, AND NUMBER OF SINUS SURGERIES PERFORMED WERE COLLECTED. RESULTS: 40 AERD PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED, WITH FOLLOW-UP DURATION UP TO 10 YEARS (AVG OF 5.2 YEARS). ALL PATIENTS WERE TREATED WITH TOPICAL SALINE AND BUDESONIDE IRRIGATIONS, INTRANASAL STEROID SPRAY, AND MONTELUKAST. 19 PATIENTS HAD UNCONTROLLED SINUS DISEASE REQUIRING MULTIPLE STEROID TAPERS AND WERE SWITCHED FROM MONTELUKAST TO ZILEUTON (COHORT 1, 47.5%) AT SOME POINT IN THEIR TREATMENT. 21 PATIENTS (COHORT 2, 52.5%) NEVER NEEDED ZILEUTON. THE AVERAGE DURATION OF TREATMENT WITH ZILEUTON WAS 6 YEARS. PATIENTS WHO REQUIRED ZILEUTON HAD A WORSE SNOT-22 (32.1 VS 19, P = 0.117), WORSE LK SCORE (8.1 VS 7.5, P = 0.504), AND HIGHER AVERAGE NUMBER OF SURGERIES (1.9 VS 1.6, P = 0.343). THE OUTCOMES IN THE ZILEUTON COHORT TRENDED TOWARD IMPROVEMENT, HOWEVER THESE DID NOT REACH STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE WITH AN IMPROVED SNOT-22 FROM 32.1 TO 27.4 (P = 0.617) AND LK SCORE FROM 7.9 TO 6.2 (P = 0.092); THE ADDITION OF ZILEUTON SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERED THE NUMBER OF SURGERIES NEEDED TO AN AVERAGE OF 0.5 (P < 0.0001).

THIS STUDY COMPARES EARLY-ONSET AND LATE-ONSET ASTHMA IN A CRS POPULATION USING PATIENT-REPORTED AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS. METHODS: AT ENROLLMENT INTO A CLINICAL REGISTRY, CRS PATIENTS COMPLETED THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), ASTHMA CONTROL TEST (ACT), MINI-ASTHMA QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE (MINIAQLQ), THE 29-ITEM PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES MEASUREMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PROMIS-29), AND MEDICATION USE QUESTIONNAIRES. PATIENTS ALSO REPORTED COMORBID ASTHMA AND AGE AT FIRST ASTHMA DIAGNOSIS. EARLY-ONSET (<18 YEARS) AND LATE-ONSET (>18 YEARS) ASTHMA GROUPS WERE DEFINED. ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA), CHI-SQUARE, AND KRUSKAL-WALLIS TESTS WERE USED TO COMPARE PATIENT RESPONSES. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 199 NON-ASTHMATIC (56.1%), 71 EARLY-ONSET ASTHMATIC (20.0%), AND 85 LATE-ONSET ASTHMATIC (23.9%) CRS PATIENTS COMPLETED THE SURVEY.

HOWEVER, IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER THERE ARE SEASONAL VARIATIONS IN THE SINONASAL SYMPTOM BURDEN OF CRS. METHODS: THIS WAS A RETROSPECTIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY OF SINONASAL SYMPTOM BURDEN MEASURED USING THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AND ITS FOUR ASSOCIATED NASAL, SLEEP, EAR/FACIAL DISCOMFORT AND EMOTIONAL SUBDOMAINS IN 1028 INDIVIDUALS WITH CRS. THE SEASON (WINTER, SPRING, SUMMER OR FALL) WHEN THE SNOT-22 WAS COMPLETED WAS RECORDED. REGRESSIONS, CONTROLLING FOR CLINICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, WERE PERFORMED TO SEEK ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SEASON OF THE YEAR AND SNOT-22 TOTAL AND SUBDOMAIN SCORES. RESULTS: THE MEAN SNOT-22 SCORES WERE 37.4 FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS COMPLETING THEIR SNOT-22 IN THE FALL, 40.5 IN THE WINTER, 37.4 IN THE SPRING AND 36.0 IN THE SUMMER. THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HIGHER SNOT-22 SCORES AND COMPLETING THE SNOT-22 IN THE WINTERTIME (ADJUSTED <U+0392> = 4.08, 95% CI 0.74-7.42, P = 0.017). WHEN SEEKING ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SEASON AND SNOT-22 SUBDOMAIN SCORES, WINTERTIME WAS ASSOCIATED ONLY WITH HIGHER EMOTIONAL (ADJUSTED <U+0392> = 0.48, 95% CI 0.14-0.81, P = 0.006) AND SLEEP (ADJUSTED <U+0392> = 2.23, 95% CI 0.54-3.91, P = 0.010) SUBDOMAIN SCORES. EXAMINING INDIVIDUAL SNOT-22 ITEMS, THESE ASSOCIATIONS WERE DUE TO MORE SYMPTOMS RELATED TO DEPRESSED MOOD (\"SAD\") AND PSYCHOMOTOR RETARDATION. CONCLUSION: THERE ARE SEASONAL VARIATIONS IN SYMPTOM BURDEN OF CRS PATIENTS, INDEPENDENT OF AEROALLERGEN HYPERSENSITIVITY, WITH THE GREATEST INCREASE IN BASELINE CRS SYMPTOMATOLOGY DURING THE WINTER. THIS FINDING WAS MOST STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED EMOTIONAL SYMPTOMATOLOGY AND DEPRESSED MOOD.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, MEDICAL SCIENCES BUILDING ROOM 6410, 231 ALBERT SABIN WAY, CINCINNATI, OH, 45267-0528, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, BOSTON, MA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MA, USA.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER, BOSTON, MA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, BOSTON, MA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, MEDICAL SCIENCES BUILDING ROOM 6410, 231 ALBERT SABIN WAY, CINCINNATI, OH, 45267-0528, USA.; AHMAD.;SEDAGHAT@UC.;EDU.;","ORCID: 0000-0001-6331-2325",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019/07/17 06:00","20200106","20190715",2019,"2019/07/17 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"10",NA,"1434-4726 (ELECTRONIC) 0937-4477 (LINKING)","9002937","EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY : OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN FEDERATION OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGICAL SOCIETIES (EUFOS) : AFFILIATED WITH THE GERMAN SOCIETY FOR OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY","ENG","10.1007/S00405-019-05555-W [DOI]","20200309","2020/01/07 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","2803-2809","GERMANY",NA,NA,"31309274","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"EUR ARCH OTORHINOLARYNGOL. 2019 OCT;276(10):2803-2809.

PROCEDURES: A GROUP OF 97 PATIENTS WITH CRS COMPLETED THE VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS) SYMPTOM SCORE AND THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST 22 (SNOT-22) QUESTIONNAIRE IN THE MOMENT OF THEIR SINUS COMPUTERIZED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) SCAN. DATA WERE ANALYZED VIA A 2-STEP CLUSTER ANALYSIS BASED ON GENDER, POLYP PRESENCE, CT SCAN, AND VAS SCORES FOR SYMPTOMS. RESULTS: THERE WERE 3 CLUSTERS: THE FIRST CLUSTER COMPRISED 37 FEMALE PATIENTS WITH CRS WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS (CRSSNP), THE SECOND CLUSTER COMPRISED 30 PATIENTS WITH CRS AND NP (CRSWNP; 15 MALES AND 15 FEMALES); AND THIRD CLUSTER HAD 30 MALE PATIENTS WITH CRS WITHOUT NP (CRSSNP).

OBJECTIVE: TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER PATIENTS WITH ATOPY AND CRS CAN BE DEFINED BY MARKERS OF TISSUE HISTOPATHOLOGY, SYSTEMIC BIOMARKERS, AND CLINICAL FACTORS, WHICH MAY GUIDE THEIR RESPONSE TO NEW PHARMACOLOGIC AGENTS. METHODS: IN A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT OF CRS PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY, A STRUCTURED HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT CONSISTING OF 12 VARIABLES, COMORBID CONDITIONS, PREOPERATIVE TOTAL SERUM IGE LEVELS, AND PREOPERATIVE MODIFIED LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPIC AND SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES WERE COMPARED BETWEEN ATOPIC CRS (ACRS) AND NON-ACRS CONTROL PATIENTS IN A MULTIVARIABLE MODEL. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 380 CRS PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED, 286 OF WHOM HAD COMORBID ATOPY (ACRS). COMPARED WITH NON-ACRS, ACRS PATIENTS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PREOPERATIVE TOTAL SNOT-22 SCORES (40.45 ± 22.68 VS 29.70 ± 20.68, P = .015) AND SYMPTOM-SPECIFIC SNOT-22 SCORES IN ALL DOMAINS EXCEPT PSYCHOLOGICAL DYSFUNCTION. RELATIVE TO NON-ACRS, ACRS PATIENTS HAD INCREASED TISSUE EOSINOPHILIA (P < .0001), EOSINOPHIL AGGREGATES (P < .0001), CHARCOT-LEYDEN CRYSTALS (P < .04), FIBROSIS (P < .02), TOTAL SERUM IGE LEVELS (P < .04), POLYPLOID DISEASE (P < .001), AND A PREVALENCE OF COMORBID ASTHMA (P < .0001) AND ASPIRIN EXACERBATED RESPIRATORY DISEASE (AERD) (P < .003). PATIENTS WITH ACRS DEMONSTRATED INCREASED TISSUE EOSINOPHILIA COMPARED WITH NON-ACRS PATIENTS EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR POLYPOID DISEASE, ASTHMA, AND AERD. CONCLUSION: IN THE CONTEXT OF CRS, ATOPY APPEARS TO BE A SPECIFIC PREDICTOR OF CRS SEVERITY LINKED TO SPECIFIC HISTOPATHOLOGIC VARIABLES, INCLUDING ENHANCED EOSINOPHILIC AGGREGATES. MOVING FORWARD, ALLERGIC STATUS MAY BE A USEFUL WAY TO IDENTIFY AN ATOPIC ENDOTYPE OF CRS PATIENTS. FURTHERMORE, AFTER SURGERY, PATIENTS ARE OFTEN MAINTAINED ON INTRANASAL CORTICOSTEROIDS. IN PATIENTS WHOSE DISEASE IS UNRESPONSIVE TO STEROIDS, WE MAY LOOK TO ATOPIC STATUS TO IDENTIFY ANOTHER MANAGEMENT THERAPY. ATOPIC CRS PATIENTS, IRRESPECTIVE OF POLYP AND ASTHMATIC STATUS, COULD BE OPTIMAL CANDIDATES FOR BIOLOGIC AGENTS SUCH AS T-HELPER CELL, EOSINOPHIL, AND/OR IGE-TARGETED THERAPIES.","RUSH MEDICAL COLLEGE, RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, CHICAGO, ILL.; RUSH SINUS PROGRAM, DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, CHICAGO, ILL.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY WEXNER MEDICAL CENTER, COLUMBUS, OHIO.; DEPARTMENT OF PATHOLOGY, RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, CHICAGO, ILL.; RUSH SINUS PROGRAM, DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, CHICAGO, ILL.; SECTION OF ALLERGY/IMMUNOLOGY, DEPARTMENT OF INTERNAL MEDICINE, RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, CHICAGO, ILL.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: MAHBOOBEH_MAHDAVINIA@RUSH.;EDU.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT © 2021 AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGY.

THIS STUDY EVALUATED OLFACTORY FUNCTION AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) IN CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS) PATIENTS BEFORE AND AFTER TOTAL ETHMOIDECTOMY WITH FRONTAL SINUSOTOMY (FS). STUDY DESIGN: PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF ADULT CRS PATIENTS UNDERGOING FSS (DRAF 2 OR DRAF 3 PROCEDURES) WAS CONDUCTED AT A TERTIARY CARE CENTER. PRIMARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED BRIEF SMELL IDENTIFICATION TEST (BSIT) AND SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22), WHICH WERE ASSESSED DURING PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION, 6 TO 9 WEEKS POSTOPERATIVELY, AND 12 TO 24 WEEKS POSTOPERATIVELY. NORMOSMIA WAS DEFINED AS BSIT =9. STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE WAS DETERMINED USING THE WILCOXON SIGNED-RANK TEST WITH <U+0391> = .05. RESULTS: THIRTY-EIGHT PATIENTS FOLLOWED UP 12 TO 24 WEEKS AFTER FSS. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BASELINE AND LONG-TERM OUTCOMES FOR BSIT (6.11 VS. 8.24, P = .00034) AND SNOT-22 (55.49 VS. 24.32, P < .00001) SCORES WERE FOUND TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT.

HOWEVER, THEIR POTENTIAL UTILITY IN PREDICTING POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES HAS NOT BEEN ASSESSED. THEREFORE, IN THIS STUDY WE EVALUATED THE ROLE OF MUCUS CYTOKINES IN PREDICTING 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOMES TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES AFTER ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS) IN A PROSPECTIVE COHORT OF CRS PATIENTS. METHODS: ONE HUNDRED FORTY-SEVEN PATIENTS WITH CRS ELECTING SURGICAL THERAPY WERE ENROLLED IN A LONGITUDINAL COHORT STUDY. MUCUS WAS COLLECTED INTRAOPERATIVELY FROM THE MIDDLE MEATUS AND TESTED FOR INTERLEUKIN (IL)-1<U+0392>, IL-2, -4, -5, -6, -7,- 8, -9, -10, -12, -13, -17A, AND -21; TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR (TNF)-<U+0391>; INTERFERON-G; EOTAXIN; AND RANTES (REGULATED-ON-ACTIVATION, NORMAL T-CELL EXPRESSED AND SECRETED) EXPRESSION USING A MULTIPLEX FLOW-CYTOMETRIC BEAD ASSAY. SIXTY-TWO PATIENTS WERE FOLLOWED POSTOPERATIVELY (AVERAGE, 10.2 MONTHS) WITH BASELINE AND FOLLOW-UP SNOT-22 SURVEYS. STEPWISE MULTIVARIATE LINEAR REGRESSION WAS USED TO MODEL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN BASELINE CYTOKINES, PHENOTYPE, AND AVERAGE POSTOPERATIVE SNOT-22 TOTAL AND DOMAIN SCORES. A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH USING A RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM WAS ALSO USED TO INVESTIGATE POTENTIAL NONLINEAR RELATIONSHIPS. RESULTS: IL-5 WAS AN INDEPENDENT PREDICTOR OF POSTOPERATIVE TOTAL SNOT-22 IMPROVEMENT (<U+0392> = -8.8, P < 0.0001), WHEREAS IL-2 LEVELS PREDICTED POSTOPERATIVE WORSENING (<U+0392> = 6.97, P = 0.0015). SIMILAR RELATIONSHIPS WERE ALSO SEEN FOR POSTOPERATIVE SNOT-22 DOMAIN SCORES. THE OVERALL MODEL WAS ALSO NOTED TO BE SIGNIFICANT FIT FOR THE DATA (ADJUSTED R(2) = 0.398, P < 0.0001). THE RANDOM FOREST MODEL SIMILARLY IDENTIFIED IL-5, TNF-<U+0391>, IL-13, AND IL-2 AS MAJOR PREDICTORS OF POSTOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORES.

RESULTS: AMONG THE 101 PATIENTS, 49 PATIENTS (48.5%) HAD AN ETDQ-7 SCORE OF =14.5, SIGNIFYING CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT ETD. THE MEAN ± STANDARD DEVIATION (SD) ETDQ-7 SCORE OF THE ENTIRE COHORT WAS 17.8 ± 10.1. THERE WAS A MODERATELY STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN ETDQ-7 AND THE SNOT-22 EAR SUBDOMAIN (<U+03A1> = 0.691, P < 0.001). THE CORRELATION COEFFICIENT BETWEEN ETDQ-7 AND TOTAL SNOT-22 SCORES WAS <U+03A1> = 0.491 (P < 0.001), INDICATING MODERATE CORRELATION.

METHODS: A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED OF AERD PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS) WITHOUT AD BETWEEN 2010 AND 2019. THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE REVISION SURGERY RATE AND TIME TO REVISION SURGERY. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED CHANGES IN 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES AND LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPY SCORES (LKES). A SUBGROUP ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED FOR PATIENTS ON MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY THERAPY (MAT).

METHODS: ADULTS WITH CRS UNDERGOING ESS WERE PROSPECTIVELY ENROLLED FROM 5 CENTERS ACROSS NORTH AMERICA. THE SCT WAS ADMINISTERED AT BASELINE AND ONCE 6 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY. QUALITY OF LIFE AND DISEASE BURDEN WERE EVALUATED USING THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AND LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPY SCORES. LINEAR REGRESSION WAS USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER SPECIFIC DEMOGRAPHIC, COMORBIDITY, OR DISEASE SEVERITY MEASURES WERE INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN SCT SCORES POSTOPERATIVELY. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 218 PATIENTS, 111 FEMALES (50.9%) AND 107 MALES (49.1%), WERE ENROLLED, WITH MEAN ± STANDARD DEVIATION AGE OF 50.1 ± 15.6 YEARS. MEAN SCT SCORE IMPROVED FROM 8.9 ± 3.5 TO 4.3 ± 3.7 POSTOPERATIVELY (P < 0.001). PREOPERATIVELY, 21.6% WERE UNCONTROLLED, 71.5% PARTIALLY CONTROLLED, AND 6.9% CONTROLLED. POSTOPERATIVELY, 6.0% WERE UNCONTROLLED, 42.6% PARTIALLY CONTROLLED, AND 51.4% CONTROLLED (P < 0.001). CHANGE IN SCT SCORE CORRELATED INDEPENDENTLY WITH CHANGE IN SNOT-22 (R = 0.500, P < 0.001) AND ENDOSCOPY SCORES (R = 0.310, P < 0.001). ENDOSCOPY SCORES DID NOT CORRELATE WITH CONTROL STATUS AMONG PATIENTS WITH CRS WITHOUT NASAL POLYPOSIS (CRSSNP) NOR BETWEEN UNCONTROLLED AND PARTIALLY CONTROLLED PATIENTS. DEMOGRAPHICS AND COMORBIDITIES WERE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN SCT. CONCLUSION: IMPROVEMENT IN DISEASE CONTROL FOLLOWING ESS AS MEASURED BY THE SCT CORRELATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN SNOT-22 AND ENDOSCOPY SCORES. THE SCT IS AN EASILY ADMINISTERED INSTRUMENT THAT PROVIDES INFORMATION COMPLEMENTARY TO EXISTING PATIENT-REPORTED AND OBJECTIVE MEASURES OF DISEASE SEVERITY.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, OREGON HEALTH AND SCIENCE UNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OR.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF UTAH SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, SALT LAKE CITY, UT.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO, AURORA, CO.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, OREGON HEALTH AND SCIENCE UNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OR.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO, AURORA, CO.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.;","ORCID: 0000-0002-4000-946X ORCID: 0000-0002-6424-7083 ORCID: 0000-0003-0560-5028","© 2020 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2020/07/27 06:00","20210929","20200726",2021,"2020/07/28 06:00",NA,NA,"R01 DC005805/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/UNITED STATES","2",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.22659 [DOI]","20210929","2021/09/30 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","106-114","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"32713106","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2021 FEB;11(2):106-114.

OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO DETERMINE THE RESPONSIVENESS AND MINIMAL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE (MCID) OF THE EQ-5D HEALTH UTILITY VALUE (EQ-5D HUV) AND VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (EQ-5D VAS) IN CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS). METHODS: 203 ADULTS UNDERGOING MEDICAL MANAGEMENT FOR CRS WERE PROSPECTIVELY RECRUITED. GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL (USING EQ-5D HUV AND EQ-5D VAS) AND CRS-SPECIFIC QOL (USING THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST [SNOT-22]) WERE MEASURED AT ENROLLMENT AND A SUBSEQUENT FOLLOW-UP TIME POINT 2-12 MONTHS LATER. AT FOLLOW-UP, PARTICIPANTS ALSO RATED CHANGE IN GENERAL HEALTH AS MUCH WORSE, A LITTLE WORSE, ABOUT THE SAME, A LITTLE BETTER OR MUCH BETTER COMPARED TO ENROLLMENT. THE EQ-5D HUV AND EQ-5D VAS MCIDS WERE CALCULATED USING DISTRIBUTION-BASED, ANCHOR-BASED, AND RECEIVER OPERATOR CHARACTERISTIC (ROC) CURVE-BASED METHODS. RESULTS: CHANGE IN SNOT-22 SCORE WAS CORRELATED WITH EQ-5D HUV AND EQ-5D VAS CHANGE. USING THE DIFFERENT METHODS OF CALCULATING MCID, WE FIND THE EQ-5D HUV MCID TO BE 0.04 AND EQ-5D VAS MCID TO BE 8.0. THE CALCULATED EQ-5D MCIDS HAD APPROXIMATELY A SENSITIVITY OF 40-50% AND SPECIFICITY OF 80% IN DETECTING PATIENTS EXPERIENCING NOTICEABLE IMPROVEMENT IN GENERAL HEALTH. CONCLUSIONS: THE EQ-5D RESPONDS WELL TO CHANGING CRS SYMPTOMATOLOGY.

OBJECTIVE: DETERMINE IF PREOPERATIVE ASSESSMENT OF TYPE AND GRADE OF INFLAMMATION AND CLINICAL FACTORS CAN PREDICT DISEASE CONTROL WITH ESS PLUS LONG-TERM LOCAL CORTICOSTEROIDS IN CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITH NASAL POLYPS (CRSWNP). METHODS: EIGHTY PATIENTS TREATED WITH ESS PLUS MOMETASONE-FUROATE 200 <U+039C>G BID FOR CRSWNP AND FOLLOWED FOR AT LEAST 1 YEAR WERE ENROLLED (NOVEMBER 2017-DECEMBER 2018) IN THIS PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL STUDY. TYPE AND GRADE OF INFLAMMATION WERE EVALUATED PREOPERATIVELY BY NASAL CYTOLOGY. BASED ON CELLULAR PATTERN, PATIENTS WERE GROUPED AS NEUTROPHILIC (N = 20), EOSINOPHILIC (N = 38), OR MIXED EOSINOPHIL-NEUTROPHILIC (N = 22). SNOT-22 AND LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPIC SCORE WERE EVALUATED AT BASELINE AND AT 3, 6, 9, AND 12 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY AND USED TO DEFINE DISEASE CONTROL. RESULTS: THE CUMULATIVE PROBABILITY OF REMAINING FREE OF SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATION OF ENDOSCOPIC SCORE (LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPIC SCORE >2) AT 3, 6, 9, AND 12 MONTHS WAS 0.84, 0.76, 0.71, AND 0.68, RESPECTIVELY. AT 12-MONTH POSTOPERATIVE EVALUATION GOOD DISEASE CONTROL WAS OBSERVED IN 54 OF 80 PATIENTS (67.5%). COMPARED TO THOSE WITH GOOD POST-OPERATIVE DISEASE CONTROL, THOSE WITH POOR CONTROL HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PRE-OPERATIVE MEAN COUNT OF EOSINOPHILS AND NEUTROPHILS (P < 0.05). THE PREOPERATIVE INFLAMMATORY PATTERN WAS ASSOCIATED WITH RELATIVE RISK OF POOR CONTROL: NEUTROPHILIA (RR: 3.10; CI:1.24-7.71), EOSINOPHILIA (RR:8.42; CI:2.72-15.12), AND MIXED EOSINOPHILIC AND NEUTROPHILIC (RR:25.11; CI:19.41-30.01). WE ALSO CONFIRMED THAT ASTHMA, ALLERGY, BLOOD EOSINOPHILIA, AND ASA TRIAD COULD PREDICT POOR CONTROL.

OUTCOMES WERE ANALYZED BY CRS SUBTYPES. RESULTS: ESS WAS PERFORMED IN 424 CRS PATIENTS (CRS WITH NASAL POLYPS [CRSWNP], N = 170; CRS WITHOUT POLYPS [CRSSNP], N = 254). MOST PATIENTS (309; 72.9%) COULD NOT BE SPECIFICALLY SUBTYPED; 115 (27.1%) WERE SUBTYPED AS FOLLOWS: ASPIRIN-EXACERBATED RESPIRATORY DISEASE (AERD), N = 47 (11.1%); ALLERGIC FUNGAL SINUSITIS (AFS), N = 39 (9.2%); IMMUNODEFICIENCY, N = 21 (5.0%); GRANULOMATOSIS WITH POLYANGIITIS (GPA), N = 5 (1.2%); AND EOSINOPHILIC GRANULOMATOSIS WITH POLYANGIITIS (EGPA), N = 3 (0.7%).

COMPARED TO THEIR YOUNGER COUNTERPARTS, DIFFERENCES EXIST IN THE ETIOLOGY OF CRS AND OUTCOMES OF ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS) FOR ELDERLY PATIENTS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO DETERMINE IF DIFFERENCES IN SURGICAL OUTCOMES ARE PRESENT BETWEEN THESE TWO PATIENT POPULATIONS TO FACILITATE PATIENT PRE-OPERATIVE COUNSELING BY THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. METHODS: RETROSPECTIVE CHART REVIEW CONDUCTED AT A SINGLE TERTIARY CARE CENTER FOR PATIENTS UNDERGOING ESS BETWEEN JUNE 2014 AND JUNE 2019. PATIENTS WERE CLASSIFIED INTO TWO COHORTS (ADULT AND ELDERLY) BASED ON AGE (< 65 AND = 65 YEARS OLD). DEMOGRAPHICS, SURGICAL, AND POSTOPERATIVE VARIABLES WERE EXTRACTED FROM OUR INSTITUTION'S ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS. ANOVA AND T-TEST ANALYSIS WERE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE PRESENCE OF SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO COHORTS. SNOT-22 SCORES WERE USED TO DETERMINE QOL IMPROVEMENTS. RESULTS: COMPARED TO THE ADULT COHORT, ELDERLY PATIENTS HAD SIGNIFICANT QOL IMPROVEMENT AFTER SURGICAL TREATMENT (P = 0.001), BUT HAD A SIMILAR SUCCESSFUL RESPONSE TO TREATMENT (P = 0.74). ELDERLY PATIENTS HAD NO DIFFERENCE IN THE INCIDENCE OF OPERATIVE/PERIOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS (P = 0.89) OR INTRAOPERATIVE OR POSTOPERATIVE BLEEDING (P = 0.301, P = 0.62), BUT HAD AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF POSTOPERATIVE INFECTION (P = 0.000). CONCLUSION: ESS REMAINS AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT MODALITY FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF CRS, AND A SAFE PRACTICE FOR ELDERLY PATIENTS DESPITE THE INCREASE IN COMPLEXITY OF THEIR MEDICAL COMORBIDITIES AND POLYPHARMACY. QOL IMPROVEMENTS ARE SIGNIFICANT, THOUGH PATIENT COUNSELING SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT IMPROVEMENTS MAY NOT BE AS PRONOUNCED AS IN YOUNGER PATIENTS.","DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND ALLERGY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS FOR MEDICAL SCIENCES (UAMS), 4301 W MARKHAM ST # 543, LITTLE ROCK, AR, 72205, USA.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND ALLERGY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS FOR MEDICAL SCIENCES (UAMS), 4301 W MARKHAM ST # 543, LITTLE ROCK, AR, 72205, USA.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND ALLERGY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS FOR MEDICAL SCIENCES (UAMS), 4301 W MARKHAM ST # 543, LITTLE ROCK, AR, 72205, USA.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND ALLERGY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS FOR MEDICAL SCIENCES (UAMS), 4301 W MARKHAM ST # 543, LITTLE ROCK, AR, 72205, USA.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND ALLERGY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS FOR MEDICAL SCIENCES (UAMS), 4301 W MARKHAM ST # 543, LITTLE ROCK, AR, 72205, USA.; AKANAAN@UAMS.;EDU.;","ORCID: 0000-0003-4114-7415",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020/11/03 12:49","20210423","20201103",2021,"2020/11/04 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"5",NA,"1434-4726 (ELECTRONIC) 0937-4477 (LINKING)","9002937","EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY : OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN FEDERATION OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGICAL SOCIETIES (EUFOS) : AFFILIATED WITH THE GERMAN SOCIETY FOR OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY","ENG","10.1007/S00405-020-06453-2 [DOI]","20210423","2021/04/24 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","1471-1476","GERMANY",NA,NA,"33141253","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"EUR ARCH OTORHINOLARYNGOL. 2021 MAY;278(5):1471-1476.

OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO IDENTIFY PATIENT COVARIATES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SUBSET OF PATIENTS WHO ELECT THIS CHANGE IN TREATMENT MODALITY. STUDY DESIGN: RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF A PROSPECTIVE, MULTI-CENTER COHORT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH CRS ENROLLED BETWEEN MARCH 2011 AND JUNE 2015 IN ACADEMIC, TERTIARY REFERRAL CLINICS. METHODS: SUBJECTS WHO INITIALLY ELECTED CMT WERE FOLLOWED UP TO 18 MONTHS, PROVIDED A COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL HISTORY, AND COMPLETED THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AT BASELINE AND DURING 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP INTERVALS. HAZARD REGRESSION MODELING WAS USED TO IDENTIFY COVARIATES ASSOCIATED WITH ELECTIVE CHANGE IN TREATMENT MODALITY. RESULTS: ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY-NINE SUBJECTS WERE FOLLOWED FOR AN AVERAGE 15.1 (STANDARD DEVIATION ± 4.6) MONTHS. SUBJECTS WHO ELECTED ESS (55 OF 179) HAD SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE AVERAGE ENDOSCOPY SCORES AND REPORTED WORSE SNOT-22 SLEEP DYSFUNCTION SCORES AT BASELINE (P = 0.026). FOR EACH SINGLE INCREASING (WORSENING) POINT OF LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPY SCORE, THE HAZARD RATIO (HR) OF CROSSOVER INCREASED BY ~6%. SIMILARLY, FOR EVERY POINT OF WORSENING IN BASELINE SNOT-22 TOTAL SCORE, THE HAZARD OF TREATMENT CROSSOVER INCREASED BY ~2%. AFTER COVARIATE ADJUSTMENT, ONLY BASELINE SNOT-22 SLEEP DYSFUNCTION SCORES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK OF TREATMENT CROSSOVER (HR = 1.07; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL: 1.02-1.11; P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: BASELINE TOTAL SNOT-22 AND ENDOSCOPY SCORES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH TREATMENT CROSSOVER, BUT REPORTED SLEEP DYSFUNCTION IS THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT INDEPENDENT PREDICTOR OF TREATMENT CROSSOVER.

DESPITE THESE OBSERVED MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES, IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHETHER THIS SUBPOPULATION OF PATIENTS EXPERIENCES CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT SINONASAL DISEASE. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY RHINOSINUSITIS IN TL PATIENTS USING RADIOGRAPHIC IMAGING. METHODS: AN INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD-APPROVED RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW (JANUARY 2005-JULY 2017) IDENTIFIED 50 PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT RADIOGRAPHIC IMAGING BEFORE AND AFTER TL. THE LUND-MACKAY STAGING SYSTEM (LM) WAS APPLIED TO 197 SURVEILLANCE COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SCANS. SURVEYED PATIENTS ALSO UNDERWENT INVESTIGATION OF CURRENT SINONASAL SYMPTOMATOLOGY USING THE SNOT-22 QUESTIONNAIRE. SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION WAS MODELED TO LM SCORES; TESTS OF STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE WERE ESTIMATED VIA THE METHOD OF KENWARD AND ROGER. RESULTS: THE MEAN AGE WAS 62.4 YEARS, WITH A 5:1 MALE-TO-FEMALE RATIO. THE MEAN SNOT-22 SCORE WAS 27.4 (RANGE, 5-33). A MEDIAN OF 3 SCANS WAS OBTAINED, 49% WITHIN 12 MONTHS AFTER TL. THE MEAN (± STANDARD DEVIATION) POSTOPERATIVE LM SCORE WAS 2.7 ± 3.97 POINTS (RANGE, 0-19). FOR EVERY 1 MONTH AFTER TL, POSTOPERATIVE LM WAS +0.01 POINT (P = .49). CONVERSELY, FOR EVERY +1 POINT IN PREOPERATIVE LM, POSTOPERATIVE LM WAS +1.08 POINTS (P < .001). TWO PATIENTS REQUIRED FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY AFTER TL FOR PERSISTENT SINONASAL DISEASE. CONCLUSIONS: PREOPERATIVE SINONASAL DISEASE BURDEN LIKELY PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT RHINOSINUSITIS IN TL PATIENTS.

METHODS: PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT CRSWNP AND COMORBID ASTHMA IN BEIJING TONGREN HOSPITAL FROM MAY TO DECEMBER OF 2020 WERE CONTINUOUSLY RECRUITED AND RECEIVED A 4-MONTH THERAPY OF STABLE BACKGROUND TREATMENT PLUS OMALIZUMAB. RESULTS OF VISUAL ANALOG SCALES (VAS) OF NASAL SYMPTOMS, SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT 22) AND NASAL POLYP SCORES WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE AND POST-TREATMENT (1, 2, 3 AND 4 MONTHS AFTER TREATMENT). BLOOD ROUTINE TESTS, TOTAL NASAL RESISTANCES (TNR), MINIMUM CROSS-SECTIONAL AREAS (MCA), TOTAL NASAL CAVITY VOLUMES (NCV), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUMES IN ONE SECOND (FEV1)/FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC) AND ADVERSE EVENTS WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE AND 4 MONTHS AFTER TREATMENT. ALL RESULTS WERE EVALUATED FOR SHORT-TERM EFFICACY OF OMALIZUMAB. GRAPHPAD PRISM 8.2.1 WAS USED FOR STATISTIC ANALYSIS. RESULTS: TEN PATIENTS WERE COLLECTED, INCLUDING 3 MALES AND 7 FEMALES, AGED (41.13±12.64) YEARS OLD (X¯±S). COMPARED TO RESULTS AT BASELINE, THE VAS SCORES OF NASAL OBSTRUCTION, RHINORRHEA, HYPOSMIA AND HEADACHE AFTER 4 MONTHS TREATMENT WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED (1.80±1.48 VS 6.70±2.83, 2.40±1.27 VS 6.40±3.44, 2.70±2.91 VS 8.20±2.25, 0.60±1.08 VS 3.60±2.72, T VALUE WAS 5.045, 4.243, 5.312, 3.402, RESPECTIVELY, ALL P<0.01). THE SCORES OF SNOT-22 (25.6±20 VS 61.3±33.32, T=4.127, P=0.002 6), NASAL POLYP SCORES (2.20±0.92 VS 4.60±0.84, T=9.000, P<0.01) AND THE COUNT AND PERCENTAGE OF EOSINOPHILS IN PERIPHERAL BLOOD WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED ((94.10±97.78)×10(9)/L VS (360.00±210.80)×10(9)/L, (32.90±27.06)% VS (64.40±20.73)%, T VALUE WAS 3.678, 2.957, RESPECTIVELY, ALL P<0.05). NCV (0-5 CM AND 0-7 CM) OF PATIENTS WERE IMPROVED FROM BASELINE ((12.62±2.84) CM(3) VS (10.40±2.09) CM(3), (27.50±14.15) CM(3) VS (16.81±6.40) CM(3), T VALUE WAS 2.371, 2.445, RESPECTIVELY, ALL P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: THE 4-MONTH TREATMENT OF OMALIZUMAB CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE NASAL SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT CRSWNP COMPLICATED WITH ASTHMA, SHRINK NASAL POLYPS SIZE AND REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PERIPHERAL BLOOD EOSINOPHILS. OMALIZUMAB CAN BE USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE THERAPY FOR REFRACTORY CRSWNP PATIENTS IN THE FUTURE.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, BEIJING TONGREN HOSPITAL, CAPITAL MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, CAMS INNOVATION FUND FOR MEDICAL SCIENCES, BEIJING 100730, CHINA BEIJING KEY LABORATORY OF NASAL DISEASES, BEIJING INSTITUTE OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, BEIJING 100005, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, BEIJING TONGREN HOSPITAL, CAPITAL MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, CAMS INNOVATION FUND FOR MEDICAL SCIENCES, BEIJING 100730, CHINA BEIJING KEY LABORATORY OF NASAL DISEASES, BEIJING INSTITUTE OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, BEIJING 100005, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, BEIJING TONGREN HOSPITAL, CAPITAL MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, CAMS INNOVATION FUND FOR MEDICAL SCIENCES, BEIJING 100730, CHINA BEIJING KEY LABORATORY OF NASAL DISEASES, BEIJING INSTITUTE OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, BEIJING 100005, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, BEIJING TONGREN HOSPITAL, CAPITAL MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, CAMS INNOVATION FUND FOR MEDICAL SCIENCES, BEIJING 100730, CHINA BEIJING KEY LABORATORY OF NASAL DISEASES, BEIJING INSTITUTE OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, BEIJING 100005, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF ALLERGY, BEIJING TONGREN HOSPITAL, CAPITAL MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, BEIJING 100730, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF ALLERGY, BEIJING TONGREN HOSPITAL, CAPITAL MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, BEIJING 100730, CHINA.; BEIJING KEY LABORATORY OF NASAL DISEASES, BEIJING INSTITUTE OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, BEIJING 100005, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, BEIJING TONGREN HOSPITAL, CAPITAL MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, CAMS INNOVATION FUND FOR MEDICAL SCIENCES, BEIJING 100730, CHINA DEPARTMENT OF ALLERGY, BEIJING TONGREN HOSPITAL, CAPITAL MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, BEIJING 100730, CHINA.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021/10/20 04:14","20211021",NA,2021,"2021/10/21 06:00",NA,NA,"2018YFC0116801/NATIONAL KEY R&D PROGRAM OF CHINA/ 82025010/THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FUND FOR DISTINGUISHED YOUNG SCHOLARS/ 81630023, 81970850, 81870698/NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA/ Z181100001618002/RESEARCH OF CAPITAL HEALTH SECURITY AND CULTIVATION/ IRT13082/THE PROGRAM FOR THE CHANGJIANG SCHOLARS AND INNOVATIVE RESEARCH TEAM/ SML20150203/BEIJING MUNICIPAL ADMINISTRATION OF HOSPITALS' MISSION PLAN/ DFL20190202/BEIJING MUNICIPAL ADMINISTRATION OF HOSPITALS' DENGFENG PLAN/","10",NA,"1673-0860 (PRINT) 1673-0860 (LINKING)","101247574","ZHONGHUA ER BI YAN HOU TOU JING WAI KE ZA ZHI = CHINESE JOURNAL OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY HEAD AND NECK SURGERY","CHI","10.3760/CMA.J.CN115330-20210608-00338 [DOI]","20211021","2021/10/21 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","1035-1041","CHINA",NA,NA,"34666463","PPUBLISH","0 (ANTIBODIES, ANTI-IDIOTYPIC) 0 (ANTI-IGE ANTIBODIES) 2P471X1Z11 (OMALIZUMAB)","IM",NA,"ZHONGHUA ER BI YAN HOU TOU JING WAI KE ZA ZHI. 2021 OCT 7;56(10):1035-1041.

OBJECTIVE: IDENTIFY SINONASAL CLINICAL VARIABLES PREDICTIVE OF ODS IN PATIENTS PRESENTING WITH UNILATERAL MAXILLARY SINUS OPACIFICATION ON SINUS CT. METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON 131 CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS WITH USD AND AT LEAST PARTIAL OR COMPLETE MAXILLARY SINUS OPACIFICATION ON SINUS CT. PATIENTS' DEMOGRAPHICS, SINONASAL SYMPTOMS (ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR DRAINAGE, NASAL OBSTRUCTION, FACIAL PRESSURE, SMELL LOSS, AND FOUL SMELL), 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST, NASAL ENDOSCOPY FINDINGS, CT FINDINGS, AND HISTOPATHOLOGY WERE COLLECTED. PATIENTS' DIAGNOSES INCLUDED ODS, CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITH OR WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS, AND INVERTED PAPILLOMA. DEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL DATA WERE COMPARED BETWEEN PATIENTS WITH UNILATERAL ODS AND NON-ODONTOGENIC DISEASE USING UNIVARIATE AND MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES. RESULTS: OF THE 131 USD PATIENTS, 65 HAD ODS AND 66 HAD NON-ODONTOGENIC DISEASE. THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH UNILATERAL ODS ON MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS: MIDDLE MEATAL PUS ON ENDOSCOPY (OR= 17.67, 95% CI-5.69, 54.87; P = 0.001), FOUL SMELL (OR= 6.11, 95% CI-1.64, 22.82; P=.007), FACIAL PRESSURE (OR= 3.55, 95% CI-1.25, 10.12; P = 0.018), AND ANY FRONTAL OPACIFICATION ON CT (OR= 5.19, 95% CI-1.68, 16.06; P = 0.004). ANY SPHENOID OPACIFICATION ON CT WAS INVERSELY RELATED TO ODS (OR = 0.14, 95% CI-0.03, 0.69; P = 0.016). THE STUDY WAS ADEQUATELY POWERED.

AIMS: TO UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AR SYMPTOMS AND GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OR AR CONTROL, BASED ON TREATMENT STATUS. METHODS: CROSS-SECTIONAL COHORT STUDY OF 130 ADULT PARTICIPANTS-65 USING NO ALLERGY MEDICATIONS AND 65 CONSISTENTLY USING INTRANASAL CORTICOSTEROID SPRAYS (ICS) IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS-PRESENTING WITH PERSISTENT AR. GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL WAS MEASURED USING THE EUROQOL 5-DIMENSIONAL VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (EQ-5D VAS). SEVERITY AND CONTROL OF AR SYMPTOMS WERE MEASURED USING THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AND THE RHINITIS CONTROL ASSESSMENT TEST (RCAT), RESPECTIVELY. WE COMPARED ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN AR SYMPTOMS AND GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL AND AR CONTROL IN PATIENTS PRESENTING WITH PERSISTENT AR WITH AND WITHOUT ICS USE. RESULTS: SEVERITY OF AR SYMPTOMS WAS SIMILAR BETWEEN COHORTS. IN PARTICIPANTS USING NO ALLERGY MEDICATIONS, EXTRANASAL AR SYMPTOM SEVERITIES WERE MOST DOMINANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED EQ-5D VAS AND RCAT SCORE. IN PARTICIPANTS USING ICS, ONLY NASAL SYMPTOM SEVERITIES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED EQ-5D VAS AND RCAT SCORES. CONSISTENTLY, ONLY IN PARTICIPANTS ON ICS WAS A DEVIATED SEPTUM ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED EQ-5D VAS (<U+0392> = - 12.1, 95% CI - 21.1 TO - 3.1, P = 0.011) AND POORLY CONTROLLED AR (OR = 4.27, 96% CI 1.27 TO 14.33; P = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: IN PERSISTENT AR DESPITE CONSISTENT ICS USE, NASAL SYMPTOMS MAY BE THE DOMINANT DRIVERS OF AR-ASSOCIATED DECREASED GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL IN CONTRAST TO PERSISTENT AR ON NO MEDICATION, WHEN EXTRANASAL SYMPTOMS OF AR ARE MOST SIGNIFICANT. LONGITUDINAL STUDY IS NEEDED TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER THESE RESULTS ARE PREDICTIVE OF RESPONSIVENESS TO ICS.","KLINIK FÜR HALS-, NASEN-, OHREN- KRANKHEITEN, HALS-UND GESICHTSCHIRURGIE, KANTONSSPITAL AARAU, AARAU, SWITZERLAND.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, 243 CHARLES STREET, BOSTON, MA, 02114, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, 243 CHARLES STREET, BOSTON, MA, 02114, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MA, USA.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER, BOSTON, MA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, 243 CHARLES STREET, BOSTON, MA, 02114, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MA, USA.; AHMAD_SEDAGHAT@MEEI.;HARVARD.;EDU.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, 243 CHARLES STREET, BOSTON, MA, 02114, USA.; AHMAD_SEDAGHAT@MEEI.;HARVARD.;EDU.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER, BOSTON, MA, USA.; AHMAD_SEDAGHAT@MEEI.;HARVARD.;EDU.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY AND COMMUNICATIONS ENHANCEMENT, BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, BOSTON, MA, USA.; AHMAD_SEDAGHAT@MEEI.;HARVARD.;EDU.;","ORCID: 0000-0001-6331-2325",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018/07/23 06:00","20190613","20180721",2019,"2018/07/23 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,"1863-4362 (ELECTRONIC) 0021-1265 (LINKING)","7806864","IRISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE","ENG","10.1007/S11845-018-1866-2 [DOI]","20200225","2019/06/14 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","703-710","IRELAND",NA,NA,"30032479","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"IR J MED SCI. 2019 MAY;188(2):703-710.

METHOD: A TOTAL OF 112 PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WHO RECEIVED ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: PACKED GROUP AND NON-PACKED GROUP. IN PACKED GROUP, THERE WERE 37 CASES, OF WHICH 10 CASES WERE COMBINED WITH ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND 11 CASES RECEIVED CORRECTION OF NASAL SEPTUM AT THE SAME TIME. IN NON-PACKED GROUP, THERE WERE 75 CASES, OF WHICH 15 CASES WERE COMBINED WITH ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND 26 CASES RECEIVED CORRECTION OF NASAL SEPTUM AT THE SAME TIME.VISUAL ANALOGUE SCORE (VAS), NASAL BLEEDING AND SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22) WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE CLINICAL EFFECT BETWEEN TWO GROUPS IN SHORT AND LONG TERM RESPECTIVELY. RESULT: THE VAS OF NASAL OBSTRUCTION, RHINODYNIA, DYSPHORIA, EPIPHORA, ITCHING, SNEEZE, HEADACHE AND FACIAL PAIN IN NON-PACKED GROUP WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THOSE IN PACKED GROUP (P < 0.05). WITHIN 48 HOURS AFTER ESS, THE AMOUNTS OF NASAL BLEEDING WERE 0-45 ML (MEDIAN 3 ML) IN PACKING GROUP AND 0-18 ML (MEDIAN 2 ML) IN NON-PACKING GROUP. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO GROUPS (Z = -3.54, P = 0.00). THE DIFFERENCE VALUE OF POSTOPERATIVE AND PREOPERATIVE SNOT-22 OF THE PACKED GROUP WAS 38.47 ± 20.25 AND THE NON-PACKED IS 41.03 ± 22.73 SIX MONTHS AFTER ESS (T = 0.58, P = 0.56). EACH GROUP HAD ONE CASE OF NASAL ADHESION. AND AS FOR MIDDLE TURBINATE DISLODGEMENT, THERE WAS ONE CASE IN THE PACKED GROUP AND TWO CASES IN THE UNPACKED GROUP. THERE WAS NO CASE OF NASAL SEPTUM HEMATOMA IN THE PACKED GROUP, BUT TWO CASES IN THE UN-PACKED GROUP. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE OF CLINICAL EFFECT BETWEEN THE POSTOPERATIVE PACKING AND UNPACKING GROUPS. CONCLUSIONS: IT IS SAFE AND PRACTICABLE TO MANAGE CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITHOUT NASAL PACKING AFTER ESS, WHICH IN SHORT TERM NOT ONLY DECREASE DISCOMFORT, BUT ALSO REDUCE NASAL BLEEDING. ALSO, THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE OF CLINICAL EFFECT BETWEEN THE POSTOPERATIVE PACKING AND UNPACKING GROUPS IN LONG THE TERM.","DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, XIJING HOSPITAL, FOURTH MILITARY MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, XI'AN 710032, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, XIJING HOSPITAL, FOURTH MILITARY MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, XI'AN 710032, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, XIJING HOSPITAL, FOURTH MILITARY MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, XI'AN 710032, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, XIJING HOSPITAL, FOURTH MILITARY MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, XI'AN 710032, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, XIJING HOSPITAL, FOURTH MILITARY MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, XI'AN 710032, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, XIJING HOSPITAL, FOURTH MILITARY MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, XI'AN 710032, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, XIJING HOSPITAL, FOURTH MILITARY MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, XI'AN 710032, CHINA; EMAIL: CHENFQ@FMMU.;EDU.;CN.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015/12/24 06:00","20160706",NA,2015,"2015/12/24 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"10",NA,"1673-0860 (PRINT) 1673-0860 (LINKING)","101247574","ZHONGHUA ER BI YAN HOU TOU JING WAI KE ZA ZHI = CHINESE JOURNAL OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY HEAD AND NECK SURGERY","CHI",NA,"20181202","2016/07/07 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","854-7","CHINA",NA,NA,"26696482","PPUBLISH","1HG84L3525 (FORMALDEHYDE) 26876-25-5 (POLYVINYL ALCOHOL FORMALDEHYDE FOAM) 9002-89-5 (POLYVINYL ALCOHOL)","IM",NA,"ZHONGHUA ER BI YAN HOU TOU JING WAI KE ZA ZHI. 2015 OCT;50(10):854-7.","MEDLINE","ZHONGHUA ER BI YAN HOU TOU JING WAI KE ZA ZHI","[COMPARATIVE STUDY ON PACKING WITH OR WITHOUT MEROCEL AFTER ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY].",NA,NA,NA,"50",NA,"PUBMED","ENDOSCOPY;EPISTAXIS/THERAPY;FORMALDEHYDE/THERAPEUTIC USE;HUMANS;NASAL SEPTUM/SURGERY;NASAL SURGICAL PROCEDURES;PARANASAL SINUSES/SURGERY;POLYVINYL ALCOHOL/THERAPEUTIC USE;POSTOPERATIVE HEMORRHAGE/PREVENTION & CONTROL;RHINITIS/SURGERY;SINUSITIS/SURGERY;WOUND HEALING",NA,0,"none","FOURTH MILITARY MEDICAL UNIVERSITY;FOURTH MILITARY MEDICAL UNIVERSITY;FOURTH MILITARY MEDICAL UNIVERSITY;FOURTH MILITARY MEDICAL UNIVERSITY;FOURTH MILITARY MEDICAL UNIVERSITY;FOURTH MILITARY MEDICAL UNIVERSITY;FOURTH MILITARY MEDICAL UNIVERSITY","FOURTH MILITARY MEDICAL UNIVERSITY;FOURTH MILITARY MEDICAL UNIVERSITY;FOURTH MILITARY MEDICAL UNIVERSITY;FOURTH MILITARY MEDICAL UNIVERSITY;FOURTH MILITARY MEDICAL UNIVERSITY;FOURTH MILITARY MEDICAL UNIVERSITY;FOURTH MILITARY MEDICAL UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED",NA,"CHEN X, 2015, ZHONGHUA ER BI YAN HOU TOU JING WAI KE ZA ZHI","CHEN X, 2015, ZHONGHUA ER BI YAN HOU TOU JING WAI KE ZA ZHI"

ALTHOUGH THE OUTCOMES OF VARIOUS INTERVENTIONS ON THESE SYMPTOM DOMAINS HAVE BEEN REPORTED, MINIMAL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE (MCID) VALUES HAVE NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED, WHICH HAS LIMITED CLINICAL INTERPRETATION OF THESE RESULTS. METHODS: THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED AS A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF A PROSPECTIVE, MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL, OBSERVATIONAL COHORT. A TOTAL OF 276 PATIENTS WITH MEDICALLY REFRACTORY CRS WHO UNDERWENT SURGICAL MANAGEMENT WERE ENROLLED. DISTRIBUTION-BASED METHODS (HALF-STANDARD DEVIATION, STANDARD ERROR OF MEASUREMENT, COHEN'S D, AND THE MINIMUM DETECTABLE CHANGE) WERE USED TO COMPUTE MCID VALUES FOR BOTH SNOT-22 TOTAL AND DOMAIN SCORES. THE MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY SHORT FORM 6D (SF-6D) HEALTH UTILITY SCORE WAS USED TO OPERATIONALIZE ANCHOR-BASED ASSOCIATIONS USING RECEIVER-OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC (ROC) CURVES. RESULTS: THE MEAN MCID OF SEVERAL DISTRIBUTION-BASED METHODS FOR TOTAL SNOT-22 SCORES WAS 9.0, IN AGREEMENT WITH PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED METRICS. AVERAGE MCID VALUES FOR THE RHINOLOGIC, EXTRANASAL RHINOLOGIC, EAR/FACIAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SLEEP DOMAIN SCORES WERE 3.8, 2.4, 3.2, 3.9, AND 2.9, RESPECTIVELY.

STUDY DESIGN: CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY. METHODS: WE PROSPECTIVELY RECRUITED 108 ASTHMATIC CRS PATIENTS AS PARTICIPANTS. ASTHMA CONTROL WAS ASSESSED USING THE ASTHMA CONTROL TEST (ACT). THE FREQUENCY OF AECRS WAS ASSESSED USING THREE PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED INDIRECT METRICS FOR AECRS: THE FREQUENCY OF PATIENT-REPORTED SINUS INFECTIONS, CRS-RELATED ANTIBIOTICS USE, AND CRS-RELATED ORAL CORTICOSTEROIDS USE IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS. CRS SYMPTOM SEVERITY WAS MEASURED USING THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN ACT SCORE AND METRICS FOR AECRS WERE PERFORMED USING LINEAR REGRESSION WHILE CONTROLLING FOR CLINICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING SNOT-22 SCORE. RESULTS: ACT SCORE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY AND NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FREQUENCY OF PATIENT-REPORTED SINUS INFECTIONS (ADJUSTED LINEAR REGRESSION COEFFICIENT [<U+0392>] = -1.2, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI]: -2.3 TO -0.1, P = .033), CRS-RELATED ANTIBIOTICS COURSES (ADJUSTED <U+0392> = -1.4, 95% CI: -2.3 TO -0.5, P = .004), AND CRS-RELATED ORAL CORTICOSTEROID COURSES (ADJUSTED <U+0392> = -1.5, 95% CI: -2.5 TO -0.5, P = .004) IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS, INDEPENDENT OF CHARACTERISTICS INCLUDING SNOT-22 SCORE. POOR ASTHMA CONTROL COULD BE DETECTED USING ONE OR MORE SINUS INFECTIONS (70.6% SENSITIVITY, 47.3% SPECIFICITY), CRS-RELATED ANTIBIOTICS (50.0% SENSITIVITY, 73.0% SPECIFICITY), OR CRS-RELATED ORAL CORTICOSTEROIDS (58.8% SENSITIVITY, 71.6% SPECIFICITY) IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS. CONCLUSIONS: AECRS ARE NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEVEL OF ASTHMA CONTROL IN ASTHMATIC CRS PATIENTS, INDEPENDENT OF CRS SYMPTOM SEVERITY. THESE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT AECRS AS A DISTINCT CLINICAL MANIFESTATION OF CRS THAT SHOULD BE ROUTINELY ASSESSED IN CRS PATIENTS. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2C.

STUDY DESIGN: PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. METHODS: THE EQ-5D-5L WAS ADMINISTERED TO 462 PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS BEFORE AND 3 MONTHS AFTER SINUS SURGERY. PREOPERATIVE AND POSTOPERATIVE SCORES ACROSS EACH OF FIVE HEALTH DIMENSIONS WERE ANALYZED AND THE RESULTS COMPARED TO THOSE OBTAINED FROM TWO WIDELY USED CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS OUTCOMES INSTRUMENTS: THE CHRONIC SINUSITIS SURVEY (CSS) AND SINONASAL OUTCOMES TEST-22 (SNOT-22). RESULTS: THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PATIENTS COMPLETED THE FIVE QUESTIONS AND VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS) OF THE EQ-5D AT BASELINE AND AT 3 MONTHS FOR A RESPONSE RATE OF 75.8%. THERE WERE NO INCOMPLETE QUESTIONNAIRES. THE FREQUENCY OF PATIENTS REPORTING PROBLEMS IN THE EQ-5D DOMAINS OF PAIN/DISCOMFORT, ANXIETY/DEPRESSION, AND USUAL ACTIVITIES DECREASED FOLLOWING SINUS SURGERY (74.3% VS. 34.4%, 48.6% VS. 31.4%, AND 30.6% VS. 19.4%, RESPECTIVELY; ALL P < 0.001). THE DOMAINS OF MOBILITY AND SELF-CARE DID NOT DEMONSTRATE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. EQ-5D VAS (STANDARD DEVIATION) IMPROVED FROM 73.4 (16.9) BEFORE SURGERY TO 82.0 (14.4) AFTER SURGERY (P < 0.001). PREOPERATIVE VAS CORRELATED WITH SNOT-22 SCORES (PEARSON COEFFICIENT OF 0.50; P < 0.01). POSTOPERATIVE CHANGE IN VAS AND SNOT-22 SCORES DEMONSTRATED MODERATE CORRELATION (PEARSON COEFFICIENT OF 0.36, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: THE EQ-5D IS A GENERAL HEALTH MEASURE WITH SENSITIVITY TO CLINICAL CHANGE IN RHINOSINUSITIS THAT SUPPORT ITS USE FOR MONITORING PATIENT OUTCOMES.

VARIOUS OBJECTIVE OUTCOME MEASURES AND PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME MEASURES (PROMS) ARE USED TO ASSESS DISEASE SEVERITY; HOWEVER, THERE IS LIMITED EVIDENCE IN THE LITERATURE ON THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THEM. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AIMS TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM AND PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS. METHODS: A SEARCH OF MEDLINE AND EMBASE IDENTIFIED STUDIES QUANTIFYING CORRELATIONS BETWEEN OBJECTIVE OUTCOME MEASURES AND PROMS FOR THE SINONASAL CONDITIONS USING A NARRATIVE SYNTHESIS. RESULTS: IN TOTAL, 59 STUDIES MET INCLUSION CRITERIA. FOR NASAL OBSTRUCTION, RHINOMANOMETRY SHOWS A LACK OF CORRELATION WHEREAS PEAK NASAL INSPIRATORY FLOW (PNIF) SHOWS THE STRONGEST CORRELATION WITH PROMS (R > 0.5). THE SNIFFIN' STICK TEST SHOWS A STRONGER CORRELATION WITH PROMS (R > 0.5) THAN THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA SMELL IDENTIFICATION TEST (UPSIT) (R < 0.5). COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) SINUS SCORES SHOW LITTLE EVIDENCE OF CORRELATION WITH PROMS AND NASAL ENDOSCOPIC RATINGS (WEAK CORRELATION, R < 0.5). CONCLUSION: OVERALL, OBJECTIVE OUTCOME MEASURES AND PROMS ASSESSING SINONASAL SYMPTOMS ARE POORLY CORRELATED, AND WE RECOMMEND THAT OBJECTIVE OUTCOME MEASURES BE USED WITH VALIDATED PROMS DEPENDING ON THE SETTING. PNIF SHOULD BE USED IN ROUTINE CLINICAL PRACTICE FOR NASAL OBSTRUCTION; RHINOMANOMETRY AND ACOUSTIC RHINOMETRY MAY BE USEFUL IN RESEARCH. THE SNIFFIN' STICKS TEST IS RECOMMENDED FOR OLFACTORY DYSFUNCTION WITH UPSIT AS AN ALTERNATIVE. CT SCORES SHOULD BE EXCLUDED AS A ROUTINE CRS OUTCOME MEASURE, AND ENDOSCOPIC SCORES SHOULD BE USED IN COMBINATION WITH PROMS UNTIL FURTHER RESEARCH IS CONDUCTED.","NORWICH MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA, NORWICH, UK.; ENT DEPARTMENT, EAST SUFFOLK AND NORTH ESSEX NHS FOUNDATION TRUST, COLCHESTER, UK.; ENT DEPARTMENT, JAMES PAGET UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL NHS FOUNDATION TRUST, GREAT YARMOUTH, UK.;","ORCID: 0000-0002-8747-5329 ORCID: 0000-0002-1125-3236","© 2020 THE AUTHORS.

SINUS SYMPTOMS WERE DETERMINED BY THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), ENDOSCOPIC EXAMINATION DETERMINED BY MODIFIED LUND KENNEDY SCORE (MLK) AND COMPUTERIZED TOMOGRAPHY SCAN OF PARANASAL SINUSES (CT-PNS) WAS EVALUATED THROUGH LUND MACKAY SCORES (LM). DATA WAS COLLECTED FROM 82 PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS (CRSSNP) AND FROM 28 PATIENTS WITH NASAL POLYPS (CRSWNP). RESULTS: LOCAL ANESTHESIA PROCEDURES WERE PERFORMED IN 45.5% OF THE PATIENTS. FIRST FOLLOW UP WAS OBTAINED AT 2 YEARS (MEDIAN 22.45 ± 13.6 MONTHS) AND AT 4 YEARS (MEDIAN 44.45 ± 14 MONTHS) AFTER BALLOON SINUPLASTY. THE MEAN BASELINE SNOT-22 SCORE WAS OF 50.26 ± 15.33 FOR PATIENTS WITH CRSSNP AND 52.25 ± 18.06 IN CRSSNP PATIENTS. BOTH SCORES WERE REDUCED TO 7.00 ± 13.5 AND 10.00 ± 22.50 AT 4 YEARS FOLLOW-UP RESPECTIVELY. BASELINE MLK SCORE WAS 4.90 ± 2.12 FOR PATIENTS IN CRSSNP GROUP AND 10.00 ± 2.00 IN THE CRSWNP GROUP BOTH SCORES WERE REDUCED TO 1.65 ± 1.67 AND 4.86 ± 2.16. THE OVERALL MEAN AVERAGE LM CT-PNS SCORE WAS 8.71 ± 4.728 PREOPERATIVELY FOR THE CRSSNP AND 16.18 ± 3.9 IN PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP AND WERE REDUCED TO 1.00 ± 1.75 AND 8.69 ± 4.6 AFTER BSP. SNOT 22, MLK AND LM SCORES SHOWED CONSISTENT IMPROVEMENT OVER BASELINE AT ALL TIME POINTS UNTIL THE END OF THE STUDY (MEDIAN 44.45 ± 14 MONTHS). SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE RECORDED AT ALL TIME POINTS IN THE PATIENT'S SYMPTOM SCORE, NASAL ENDOSCOPY SCORES AND IMAGING SCORES (P < 0.0001).

METHODS: ADULTS WITH SYMPTOMATIC CRS WERE PROSPECTIVELY ENROLLED (NOVEMBER 2016 TO OCTOBER 2018) INTO AN OBSERVATIONAL, MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL STUDY. INDIVIDUALIZED AMT WAS INITIATED USING STANDARD PRACTICE ACCORDING TO EVIDENCE-BASED GUIDELINES. ENDOSCOPY EXAMINATION (LUND-KENNEDY), OLFACTORY FUNCTION (SNIFFIN' STICKS) TESTING, AND QOL SURVEY RESPONSES (22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST [SNOT-22], QUESTIONNAIRE OF OLFACTORY DISORDERS-NEGATIVE STATEMENTS [QOD-NS]) WERE OBTAINED AT ENROLLMENT AND FOLLOW-UP.

THE EUROQOL 5-DIMENSIONAL QUESTIONNAIRE MEASURES GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGH A HEALTH UTILITY VALUE (EQ-5D HUV)-BASED ON FIVE DOMAINS REFLECTING MOBILITY, SELF-CARE, ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIFE, PAIN/DISCOMFORT, AND ANXIETY/DEPRESSION-AND AN UNBIASED VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (EQ-5D VAS). WE SOUGHT TO IDENTIFY CHARACTERISTICS OF CRS PATIENTS WITH A HIGH EQ-5D HUV BUT LOW EQ-5D VAS SCORE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RETROSPECTIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY OF 300 CRS PATIENTS WITH EQ-5D HUV EQUAL TO 1.0 (REFLECTING PERFECT HEALTH). ALL PATIENTS COMPLETED A 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22)-FROM WHICH NASAL, SLEEP, EAR/FACIAL DISCOMFORT, AND EMOTIONAL SUBDOMAIN SCORES WERE CALCULATED, AS WELL AS THE EQ-5D. LOW EQ-5D VAS WAS DEFINED AS A SCORE LESS THAN 80. RESULTS: ON MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS, LOW EQ-5D VAS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH ONLY THE SNOT-22 SLEEP SUBDOMAIN SCORE (ODDS RATIO [OR] = 1.07, 95%CI: 1.02-1.12, P = .003). COMORBID ASTHMA WAS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER EQ-5D VAS (OR = 2.16, 95%CI: 1.02-4.59, P = .045). IN CONTRAST, POLYPS WERE NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING A LOWER EQ-5D VAS (OR = 0.34, 95%CI: 0.17-0.69, P = .003). CONCLUSION: THERE ARE PATIENTS WITH PERFECT GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL ACCORDING TO A HEALTH UTILITY VALUE-BASED METHODOLOGY (LIKE THE EQ-5D HUV) WHO REPORT LOW GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL ON AN UNBIASED MEASURE LIKE THE EQ-5D VAS. IN CRS PATIENTS WITH PERFECT EQ-5D HUV, POOR SLEEP AND ASTHMA WERE ASSOCIATED WITH LOW QOL ON THE EQ-5D VAS, WHILE POLYPS WERE NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH LOW QOL.

RHINOLOGISTS STRUGGLE TO FIND OBJECTIVE TESTS THAT ADEQUATELY REFLECTS DISEASE BURDEN. THIS STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE PNIF MEASUREMENT OF THE MOST OBSTRUCTED SIDE WITH PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES. METHODS: BILATERAL AND UNILATERAL PNIF MEASUREMENTS WERE PERFORMED BEFORE AND AFTER TOPICAL DECONGESTION IN 528 PATIENTS SCHEDULED FOR SURGERY DUE TO NASAL OBSTRUCTION. SUBJECTIVE OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED USING NASAL OBSTRUCTION VAS AND SNOT-22 WITH SUBDOMAINS. CORRELATIONS BETWEEN SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE MEASUREMENTS WERE CALCULATED AND FURTHER EXPLORED USING MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION ANALYSES. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN PNIF AND PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES WERE FOUND. BOTH BILATERAL AND MINIMAL UNILATERAL PNIF CORRELATIONS WITH NO-VAS WERE EQUAL AND STRONGER THAN CORRELATIONS WITH SNOT-22 INCLUDING SUBDOMAINS CONCERNING PROBLEMS WITH NASAL OBSTRUCTION. MINIMAL UNILATERAL PNIF DID NOT SHOW STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT GENDER DIFFERENCE. TOPICAL DECONGESTION DECREASED STATISTICAL CORRELATIONS. CONCLUSIONS: THE MINIMAL UNILATERAL PNIF SHOWS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT BUT WEAK NEGATIVE CORRELATION WITH PREOPERATIVE PATIENT REPORTED NASAL OBSTRUCTION, AND VALUES DO NOT DIFFER BETWEEN GENDERS.

CLINICAL FEATURES, CT EVALUATION, PRE AND POSTOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORES AND HISTOPATHOLOGIC FINDINGS WERE COLLECTED. TISSUE EOSINOPHILS AND MUCOSAL REMODELING WERE ANALYZED RELATIVE TO CLINICAL FEATURES AND OUTCOMES 12 MONTHS POSTOPERATIVELY. RESULTS: SYMPTOM IMPROVEMENT WAS SEEN FOR THE ENTIRE POPULATION. EOSINOPHILIC CRS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE PREOPERATIVE AND POSTOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORES THAN NON- EOSINOPHILIC CRS.

THE ROLE OF ATOPY IN CRS, HOWEVER, REMAINS UNCLEAR. CORRELATIONS BETWEEN IMMUNOLOGICAL ALLERGIC MARKERS AND PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES MEASURES (PROMS) WERE INVESTIGATED. METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH CRS UNDERGOING ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY WAS CONDUCTED. IMMUNOLOGICAL ALLERGIC MARKERS INCLUDED AUTOMATED IMMUNOASSAY TESTING FOR SERUM-SPECIFIC IGE TO COMMON ALLERGENS (HOUSE DUST MITE, GRASS, MOLD, ANIMAL EPITHELIA) AND TOTAL IGE. PROMS WERE ASSESSED USING THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). PATIENTS WERE DEFINED AS ATOPIC BASED ON EITHER A POSITIVE SPECIFIC IGE OR ELEVATED TOTAL IGE (>160 KU/L). RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 446 PATIENTS (45.7% FEMALE, AGE 49.05 ± 14.96 YEARS) WERE RECRUITED, OF WHICH 42.8% HAD ASTHMA, 51.6% HAD CRSWNP, AND 63.0% HAD EOSINOPHILIC CRS. POSITIVE ALLERGEN SENSITIZATION WAS DETECTED IN 52.9% PATIENTS. TOTAL IGE LEVELS WERE ELEVATED IN 28.0% WITH MEAN IGE LEVEL OF 161 ± 269 KU/L. ATOPY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUNGER AGE AT THE TIME OF SURGERY, CRSWNP, ASTHMA, AND EOSINOPHILIC CRS (ECRS). ATOPY WAS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED SEVERITY IN NASAL SYMPTOM SCORE (13.1 ± 6.4 VS 11.9 ± 6.0, P = 0.04), AS WELL AS WORSE SCORES IN THE LOSS OF SMELL/TASTE (<U+03A7>(2) (1) = 5.97, P = 0.02) AND NEED TO BLOW NOSE (<U+03A7>(2) (1) = 4.26, P = 0.04) QUESTIONS IN THE CRS POPULATION. IN THE CRSWNP POPULATION, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN ATOPY AND PROMS. CONCLUSION: COMORBID ATOPY IN CRS IS ASSOCIATED WITH ADDITIONAL SYMPTOM BURDEN, REFLECTED MAINLY WITHIN THE NASAL SYMPTOM QUALITY OF LIFE MARKERS.

METHODS: CONSECUTIVE ADULT SUBJECTS PRESENTING TO THE OTOLARYNGOLOGY CLINICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA WITH REFRACTORY CRS THAT REQUIRED SURGERY WERE INCLUDED.

REGRESSION ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED. RESULTS: ONE HUNDRED FOUR SUBJECTS MET CRITERIA AND WERE INCLUDED. THESE SUBJECTS SHOWED A 51% OVERALL IMPROVEMENT IN POSTSURGICAL SNOT-22 EVALUATIONS (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI]: [45, 57%], P < .001). MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT SNOT-22 ITEMS RELATED TO \"RUNNY NOSE,\" \"COUGH,\" AND \"SADNESS\" WERE INDEPENDENT PREDICTORS OF POSTSURGICAL SNOT-22 IMPROVEMENT (P < .05, FOR ALL). ALTHOUGH \"RUNNY NOSE\" HAD A DIRECT CORRELATION WITH IMPROVEMENT, MORE SEVERE \"SADNESS\" AND \"COUGH\" SCORES HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON DEGREE OF IMPROVEMENT. SIMILARLY, ANALYSES INDICATED THAT QUESTIONS CATEGORIZED AS PERTAINING TO NASAL OR EAR SYMPTOMS WERE UNIQUELY ASSOCIATED WITH POSTSURGICAL IMPROVEMENT IN SNOT-22 SCORES (P < .001 AND P = .015, RESPECTIVELY). NEITHER LUND-MACKAY CT SCORING, TOTAL IGE, NOR ABSOLUTE EOSINOPHIL COUNTS CORRELATED WITH IMPROVEMENT IN POSTSURGICAL SNOT-22 SCORES.

THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW THE LITERATURE ON RARS MANAGEMENT. METHODS: COCHRANE, PUBMED, EMBASE, AND OTHER DATABASES WERE QUERIED FOR ARTICLES RELATED TO RARS DATING FROM 1990 TO PRESENT, ACCORDING TO PRISMA GUIDELINES. INCLUSION CRITERIA INCLUDED ARTICLES SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING RARS MANAGEMENT; STUDIES WITH 3 OR MORE PATIENTS; AND ARTICLES IN ENGLISH. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 1022 TITLES/ABSTRACTS POTENTIALLY RELATED TO RARS WERE IDENTIFIED. OF THESE, SIXTY-NINE FULL TEXTS WERE SELECTED FOR REVIEW, AND 10 MET INCLUSION CRITERIA (FIVE WITH LEVEL 4 EVIDENCE, FOUR WITH LEVEL 3 EVIDENCE, ONE WITH LEVEL 2 EVIDENCE). THE STUDIES INCLUDED A TOTAL OF 890 PATIENTS (AGE RANGE 5.8 TO 53.5 YEARS), WITH FOLLOW UP RANGING FROM 1 TO 19 MONTHS. ENDPOINTS WERE PRIMARILY BASED ON SYMPTOMATIC IMPROVEMENT, ALTHOUGH SOME ARTICLES ALSO REPORTED POST-TREATMENT ENDOSCOPIC AND RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS. MANAGEMENT OPTIONS INCLUDED MEDICAL THERAPY (INTRANASAL STEROIDS, ANTIBIOTICS, NASAL SALINE IRRIGATIONS, N-ACETYLCYSTEINE, ALLERGY TREATMENT, AND DECONGESTANTS), BALLOON SINUS DILATION (BSD), AND ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS). SURGICAL PATIENTS (BSD AND ESS) HAD A TREND TOWARDS GREATER SYMPTOM CONTROL THAN MEDICALLY-TREATED PATIENTS, BUT META-ANALYSIS WAS NOT POSSIBLE. CONCLUSION: DESPITE INCREASING INTEREST IN THE TREATMENT OF RARS, THERE REMAINS A LACK OF CONSENSUS REGARDING OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT. THE LITERATURE THUS FAR, LARGELY BASED ON EXPERT OPINION, SUGGESTS THAT SURGICAL MANAGEMENT, EITHER THROUGH BALLOON SINUS DILATION OR ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY, MAY BE HELPFUL IN IMPROVING SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN THOSE WHO DO NOT RESPOND TO INITIAL TRIALS OF MEDICAL MANAGEMENT.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, INDIANA UNIVERSITY HEALTH, INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-INDIANA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA.; COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY, LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY, LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY.; COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY, LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, INDIANA UNIVERSITY HEALTH, INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-INDIANA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE, LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-KENTUCKIANA EAR, NOSE & THROAT, KENTUCKY, LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.;","ORCID: 0000-0002-0410-3010",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021/02/24 05:30","20211101","20210223",2021,"2021/02/25 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"6",NA,"1945-8932 (ELECTRONIC) 1945-8932 (LINKING)","101490775","AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RHINOLOGY & ALLERGY","ENG","10.1177/1945892421994999 [DOI]","20211101","2021/11/03 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","902-909","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"33622038","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"AM J RHINOL ALLERGY. 2021 NOV;35(6):902-909.

PRIOR CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY HAS IDENTIFIED RISK FACTORS AND SYMPTOM SUBDOMAINS CONTRIBUTING TO BASELINE PRODUCTIVITY LOSS. THIS STUDY EVALUATES CORRELATIONS BETWEEN POSTTREATMENT CHANGES IN SYMPTOM SUBDOMAIN AND PRODUCTIVITY LOSS. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 202 ADULT PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY CRS WERE PROSPECTIVELY ENROLLED INTO AN OBSERVATIONAL, MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL COHORT STUDY BETWEEN AUGUST 2012 AND JUNE 2015. RESPONDENTS PROVIDED PRETREATMENT AND POSTTREATMENT 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES. PRODUCTIVITY LOSSES WERE MONETIZED USING MEASURES OF ABSENTEEISM, PRESENTEEISM, LOST LEISURE TIME, AND U.S. GOVERNMENT-ESTIMATED WAGE AND LABOR RATES. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 39 (19%) PARTICIPANTS ELECTED CONTINUED APPROPRIATE MEDICAL THERAPY (CAMT) AND 163 (81%) ELECTED ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS). CAMT PATIENTS EXPERIENCED IMPROVEMENT IN SNOT-22 TOTAL AND RHINOLOGIC SUBDOMAIN SCORES (BOTH P = 0.039). ESS PATIENTS REPORTED IMPROVEMENT IN SNOT-22 TOTAL SCORES AND ALL SUBDOMAINS (ALL P < 0.001). MEAN MONETIZED PRODUCTIVITY LOSSES WERE NEARLY UNCHANGED FOLLOWING CAMT (-$200, P = 0.887) BUT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED FOLLOWING ESS (-$5,015, P < 0.001).

CONCLUSION: TREATMENT MODALITIES ASSOCIATE WITH DIFFERENT POSTTREATMENT PRODUCTIVITY CHANGES.

EOSINOPHILIC INFLAMMATION HAS BEEN IMPLICATED AS A POTENTIAL CAUSATIVE FACTOR. HOWEVER, PRIOR STUDIES HAVE BEEN LIMITED BY RETROSPECTIVE STUDY DESIGNS, CONCOMITANT USE OF SYSTEMIC CORTICOSTEROIDS, AND OTHER CONFOUNDING FACTORS. METHODS: CRS AND HEALTHY NON-CRS CONTROL SUBJECTS UNDERGOING ENDOSCOPIC SINUS OR SKULL-BASE SURGERY WERE PROSPECTIVELY ENROLLED AND COMPLETED OLFACTORY TESTING UTILIZING THE 40-ITEM SMELL IDENTIFICATION TEST (SIT) IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO SURGERY. HISTOPATHOLOGICAL EVALUATION OF TISSUE EXCISED FROM THE ETHMOID BULLA WAS PERFORMED BY A PATHOLOGIST IN A BLINDED FASHION. DISEASE SEVERITY AND PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED VIA THE LUND-MACKAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) GRADING SYSTEM AND 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), RESPECTIVELY. THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN OLFACTORY FUNCTION, TISSUE EOSINOPHILIA, AND DISEASE SEVERITY WERE ANALYZED USING SPEARMAN RANK ORDER CORRELATION AND MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION. RESULTS: TWENTY-SEVEN (27) SUBJECTS WITH CRS WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS (CRSSNP), 32 SUBJECTS WITH CRS WITH NASAL POLYPS (CRSWNP), AND 10 HEALTHY NON-CRS CONTROLS WERE ENROLLED. CRSWNP WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER MEAN TISSUE EOSINOPHIL COUNTS (71.6 VS 28.1 EOSINOPHILS/HIGH-POWER FIELD [HPF], P < 0.05) AND LOWER AGE/SEX-ADJUSTED SIT SCORES (-17.4 VS -6.2, P < 0.001) WHEN COMPARED TO CRSSNP. SIT SCORES WERE STRONGLY NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH TISSUE EOSINOPHIL COUNTS IN CRSWNP (R = -0.60, P = 0.0003), BUT NOT CRSSNP (R = 0.16, P = 0.42). THE CORRELATION BETWEEN OLFACTORY FUNCTION AND TISSUE EOSINOPHILIA IN CRSWNP PERSISTED AFTER ADJUSTING FOR DISEASE SEVERITY. CONCLUSION: TISSUE EOSINOPHILIA IS ASSOCIATED WITH OLFACTORY LOSS IN CRSWNP, INDEPENDENT OF DISEASE SEVERITY. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST A POSSIBLE ROLE FOR EOSINOPHILS OR EOSINOPHIL-ASSOCIATED CYTOKINES IN CRS-ASSOCIATED OLFACTORY LOSS.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, NASHVILLE, TN.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, NASHVILLE, TN.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, NASHVILLE, TN.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, NASHVILLE, TN.;",NA,"© 2017 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,"CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: NONE","2017/07/26 06:00","20180604","20170725",2017,"2017/07/26 06:00",NA,NA,"L30 AI113795/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/UNITED STATES R03 DC014809/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/UNITED STATES UL1 TR000445/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/UNITED STATES","10",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (PRINT) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.21994 [DOI]","20181113","2018/06/05 06:00","NIHMS889946",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","957-962",NA,"PMC5624838",NA,"28742240","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2017 OCT;7(10):957-962.

THIS STUDY COMPARES RESPONSIVENESS OF PROMS USED IN CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS) TO INFORM THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGHLY RESPONSIVE INSTRUMENT THAT ACCURATELY PORTRAYS CRS PATIENTS' SYMPTOM EXPERIENCES. METHODS: ADULT CRS PATIENTS INITIATING MEDICAL THERAPY (MT; N = 143) OR UNDERGOING ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY AFTER FAILING MT (ESS; N = 123) COMPLETED THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), EUROPEAN POSITION STATEMENT ON RHINOSINUSITIS (EPOS) VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS), AND 29-ITEM PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES MEASUREMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PROMIS-29) AT BASELINE AND 3 MONTHS AFTER TREATMENT. COHEN'S D AND PAIRED T STATISTICS WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE RESPONSIVENESS OF EACH MEASURE. RESULTS: FIFTY-TWO (36.4%) SUBJECTS AND 42 (34.1%) SUBJECTS IN THE MT AND ESS GROUPS, RESPECTIVELY, COMPLETED BASELINE AND 3-MONTH QUESTIONNAIRES. SUBJECTS WITH AND WITHOUT 3-MONTH DATA WERE SIMILAR WITH RESPECT TO BASELINE DEMOGRAPHICS, VAS SCORES, AND SNOT-22 SCORES (P > 0.05). IN MT PATIENTS, CRS-SPECIFIC MEASURES, LIKE VAS (D = -0.58, P < 0.01; T = -1.81, P > 0.05) AND SNOT-22 (D = -0.70, P < 0.01; T = -3.29, P < 0.05) SCORES, WERE MORE RESPONSIVE THAN PROMIS-29 GENERAL HEALTH DOMAINS (P > 0.05 FOR COHEN'S D). IN ESS PATIENTS, VAS (D = -1.97; T = -9.63, BOTH P < 0.01) AND SNOT-22 (D = -1.56; T = -9.99, BOTH P < 0.01) SCORES WERE SIMILARLY MORE RESPONSIVE, ALTHOUGH CHANGES IN PROMIS-29 DOMAINS OF FATIGUE (D = -0.82, P = 0.01; T = -4.63, P < 0.01), SLEEP DISTURBANCE (D = -0.83; T = -3.77, BOTH P < 0.01), AND PAIN INTENSITY (D = -1.0; T = -5.67, BOTH P < 0.01) WERE SIGNIFICANT. ALL 22 INDIVIDUAL SNOT-22 ITEMS DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER SURGERY, WHEREAS ONLY 8 ITEMS WERE CONSISTENTLY RESPONSIVE AFTER MT. CONCLUSIONS: FOR BOTH MT AND ESS PATIENTS, CRS-SPECIFIC PROMS ARE MORE RESPONSIVE TO POSTTREATMENT CLINICAL CHANGES THAN GENERAL HEALTH MEASURES. STILL, THE SNOT-22 CONTAINS ITEMS THAT LIKELY DECREASE ITS OVERALL RESPONSIVENESS.

ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY HAD A DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT ACROSS THESE FACTORS, WITH THE LARGEST EFFECT SIZE IN RHINOLOGIC SYMPTOMS (MEAN [SD] SNOT-22 SCORES BEFORE AND AFTER SURGERY, 13.18 [5.11] AND 7.37 [5.48], RESPECTIVELY; D = -1.13 [P < .001]) AND EXTRANASAL RHINOLOGIC SYMPTOMS (8.31 [3.46] AND 4.83 [3.68], RESPECTIVELY; D = -1.00 [P < .05]) (D IS AN EFFECT SIZE MEASURE DEFINED AS THE DIFFERENCE IN MEANS DIVIDED BY THE PRESURGERY SD). ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY HAD A SMALLER, YET SIGNIFICANT, EFFECT SIZE ON THE REMAINING 3 FACTORS: EAR/FACIAL SYMPTOMS (7.32 [4.6]) AND 3.90 [4.07], RESPECTIVELY; D = -0.74 [P < .001]), PSYCHOLOGICAL DYSFUNCTION (11.90 [7.21] AND 6.50 [6.69], RESPECTIVELY; D = -0.75 [P < .05]), AND SLEEP DYSFUNCTION (10.12 [5.59] AND 5.88 [5.37], RESPECTIVELY; D = -0.76 [P < .001]). PARTICIPANTS WERE FOUND TO UNDERGO RECALIBRATION, REPRIORITIZATION, AND RECONCEPTUALIZATION OF SYMPTOMS AFTER INTERVENTION; HOWEVER, THE MAGNITUDE OF THESE RESPONSE SHIFTS WAS SMALL AND NOT CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: THE SNOT-22 MEASURES 5 DISTINCT FACTORS, NOT A SINGLE CONSTRUCT. REPORTING OF INDIVIDUAL SUBSCALE SCORES MAY IMPROVE SENSITIVITY OF THIS INSTRUMENT IN FUTURE STUDIES. PARTICIPANTS UNDERGOING ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY EXPERIENCE ONLY CLINICALLY INSIGNIFICANT RESPONSE SHIFTS, VALIDATING ASSESSMENT OF CHANGE THROUGH USE OF PRESURGERY AND POSTSURGERY SNOT-22 RESPONSES.

OBJECTIVES: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO (1) DETERMINE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN CRS SYMPTOMATOLOGY, WHICH REFLECTS CRS PATHOPHYSIOLOGY, AND SINUSITIS-RELATED ANTIBIOTIC USAGE, AND (2) TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF ANTIBIOTIC USAGE ON QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY ENROLLING 85 PARTICIPANTS MEETING CONSENSUS GUIDELINE CRITERIA FOR CRS WAS CONDUCTED. SYMPTOMATOLOGY WAS ASSESSED USING THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOMES TEST (SNOT-22) AND GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL WAS ASSESSED USING THE EUROQOL 5-DIMENSIONAL VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (EQ5D-VAS). ASSOCIATION WAS SOUGHT BETWEEN SNOT-22, THE NUMBER OF PRESCRIBED ANTIBIOTICS FOR SINUSITIS IN THE PAST YEAR, SINUS INFECTIONS IN THE PAST YEAR, AND EQ5D-VAS. ANTIBIOTIC USAGE AND NUMBER OF SINUS INFECTIONS WERE CHECKED FOR MEDIATION IN THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SNOT-22 AND EQ5D-VAS. RESULTS: THE SNOT-22 SCORE IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NUMBER OF ANTIBIOTICS TAKEN IN THE PAST YEAR (RELATIVE RISK = 1.02, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI]: 1.01-1.03, P = .002) AND EQ5D-VAS (<U+0392> = -0.37, 95% CI: -0.52 TO -0.22, P < .001). HAVING TAKEN MORE THAN 2 ANTIBIOTICS FOR SINUSITIS IN THE PAST YEAR MEDIATED 31% OF THE EFFECT OF SNOT-22 ON EQ5D-VAS, THROUGH A MEDIATION EFFECT (P = .008). ANTIBIOTIC USAGE HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH THE NUMBER OF REPORTED SINUS INFECTIONS (<U+03A1> = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.54-0.80, P < .001), WHICH ALSO SHOWED A SIMILAR STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT MEDIATION EFFECT BETWEEN SNOT-22 AND EQ5D-VAS. CONCLUSIONS: SINUSITIS-RELATED ANTIBIOTIC USAGE, LIKELY REFLECTING THE FREQUENCY OF ACUTE CRS EXACERBATIONS, MEDIATES THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN CRS SYMPTOMATOLOGY AND QOL.

HEALTH-RELATED/DISEASE-SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE [QOL]) AND ECONOMIC (E.G. DIRECT AND INDIRECT COSTS) BURDENS OF CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITH NASAL POLYPOSIS (CRSWNP). METHODS: THE SLR ADHERED TO PREFERRED REPORTING ITEMS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSES (PRISMA) GUIDELINES. EMBASE, MEDLINE AND EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE REVIEWS DATABASES WERE SEARCHED USING OVID. RELEVANT STUDIES INVOLVING ADULT PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1 JANUARY 2008 AND 16 FEBRUARY 2019 WERE INCLUDED, WITH RELEVANT CONFERENCE ABSTRACTS FROM 1 JANUARY 2017, ONWARD. RESULTS: SINO-NASAL OUTCOMES TEST (SNOT)-22 WAS THE MOST FREQUENTLY USED DISEASE-SPECIFIC HEALTH-RELATED QOL/PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES INSTRUMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP. BASELINE SNOT-22 SCORES RANGED FROM 25 TO 73 FOR SURGICAL CANDIDATES AND FROM 14 TO 56 FOR MEDICALLY MANAGED PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP. MEAN BASELINE EUROQOL-5 DIMENSIONS (EQ-5D) INDEX FOR PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP RANGED FROM 0.81 TO 0.86, AND MEAN BASELINE SHORT FORM-6 DIMENSIONS (SF-6D) RANGED FROM 0.67 TO 0.75. THREE MONTHS (EQ-5D) AND 5 YEARS (SF-6D) POST-ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS), RATES INCREASED FROM 0.81 TO 0.89 AND FROM 0.69 TO 0.80, RESPECTIVELY. ONE YEAR POST-DIAGNOSIS, PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY MORE SYSTEMIC PRESCRIPTIONS, UNDERWENT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE MEDICAL PROCEDURES, DEMONSTRATED GREATER HEALTH CARE RESOURCE UTILIZATION AND HAD SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER MEAN HEALTH CARE COSTS COMPARED WITH MATCHED CONTROLS (ALL P < .001). OVERALL, FOR PATIENTS WITH INITIAL ESS, CRSWNP WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER DISEASE-RELATED EXPENDITURES COMPARED WITH CRS WITHOUT NASAL POLYPOSIS (NP), EVEN FOR PATIENTS WHO DID NOT UNDERGO REVISION SURGERY. CONCLUSIONS: THIS SLR IDENTIFIED SUBSTANTIAL HUMANISTIC BURDEN AMONG SURGERY CANDIDATES. RWE SHOWS THAT SURGERIES WERE USED TO TREAT RELATIVELY MORE SEVERE CRSWNP PATIENTS AS RECOMMENDED BY GUIDELINES. PATIENT QOL IS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER SURGERY; HOWEVER, THERE IS A LACK OF EVIDENCE ON PATIENTS WITH REVISION SURGERY. SURGERY IS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER COSTS, AND THE PRESENCE OF NP WAS A PREDICTOR OF REVISION SURGERY. PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP DEMONSTRATE GREATER HEALTH CARE RESOURCE UTILIZATION AND COSTS COMPARED TO THOSE WITH CRS WITHOUT NP. COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT SEVERITY OF CRSWNP AND REVISION SURGERY NEED TO BE ASSESSED FURTHER.","ASTRAZENECA, GAITHERSBURG, MD, USA.; EVERSANA, BURLINGTON, CANADA.; ASTRAZENECA, GAITHERSBURG, MD, USA.; EVERSANA, BURLINGTON, CANADA.; EVERSANA, BURLINGTON, CANADA.;","ORCID: 0000-0001-5451-4670",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020/08/28 06:00","20210628","20200925",2020,"2020/08/28 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"11",NA,"1473-4877 (ELECTRONIC) 0300-7995 (LINKING)","0351014","CURRENT MEDICAL RESEARCH AND OPINION","ENG","10.1080/03007995.2020.1815683 [DOI]","20210628","2021/06/29 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","1913-1926","ENGLAND",NA,NA,"32851882","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"CURR MED RES OPIN. 2020 NOV;36(11):1913-1926.

OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS THE PREVALENCE, SEVERITY, AND ASSOCIATED FACTORS OF CRS CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND HEALTH-CARE BARRIERS IN AN URBAN HOMELESS POPULATION. METHODS: HOMELESS ADULTS COMPLETED A SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC QUESTIONNAIRE AND THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AND EUROQOL-5 DIMENSION-3 LEVEL-VISUAL ANALOG SCALE SURVEYS. RESPONSES WERE CATEGORIZED BY POTENTIAL CRS SYMPTOMS DEFINED AS REPORTING AT LEAST 2 CRS CARDINAL SYMPTOMS. RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH POTENTIAL CRS SYMPTOMS WERE ANALYZED WITH MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION MODELS. RESULTS: FIFTY-SIX (16%) OUT OF 341 TOTAL SUBJECTS REPORTED POTENTIAL CRS SYMPTOMS. THOSE WITH POTENTIAL CRS SYMPTOMS HAD A HIGHER MEDIAN SNOT-22 SCORE (53 VS 22, P < .001) THAN THOSE WITHOUT. LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS IDENTIFIED HISTORY OF SMOKING (ODDS RATIO [OR], 6.54; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], 2.04-21.04) AND DURATION OF HOMELESSNESS OVER 3 MONTHS (OR, 3.46; CI, 1.51-7.94) AS FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH POTENTIAL CRS SYMPTOMS.

CONCLUSIONS: OUR STUDY ESTIMATES A HIGH PREVALENCE OF POTENTIAL CRS SYMPTOMS IN THE URBAN HOMELESS POPULATION. LONGER DURATION OF HOMELESSNESS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH POTENTIAL CRS SYMPTOMS AND POOR CRS-SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES.

RACE AND ACCESS TO CARE HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED IN CRS DISEASE SEVERITY. STRUCTURAL HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORTING MAY AID IN DELINEATING THE INFLAMMATORY BURDEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS EFFECT. METHODS: A STRUCTURED HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT OF 14 VARIABLES WAS UTILIZED TO ASSESS SINUS TISSUE REMOVED DURING FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (FESS). HISTOPATHOLOGY VARIABLES AND 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES WERE COMPARED BY RACE (BLACK, WHITE, LATINO, AND ASIAN) AND INSURANCE STATUS (MEDICARE, MEDICAID, AND PRIVATE INSURANCE). RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 201 CRS PATIENTS (124 WHITE, 38 BLACK, 28 LATINO, AND 9 ASIAN) UNDERGOING FESS WERE INCLUDED. BLACK PATIENTS DEMONSTRATED INCREASED SNOT-22 SCORES (50.74 ± 20.32 VS 41.47 ± 22.75, P < 0.022) AND NUMBER OF EOSINOPHILS PER HIGH-POWER FIELD (>5/HPF) (60.5% VS 44.8%, P < 0.05). WHITE PATIENTS DEMONSTRATED DECREASED EOSINOPHIL AGGREGATES (22.6% VS 35.1%, P < 0.039) AND EOSINOPHILS/HPF (<5/HPF) (42.7% VS 55.8%, P < 0.048). MEDICAID PATIENTS SHOWED INCREASED SNOT-22 SCORE (55.50 ± 24.46 VS 41.39 ± 21.74, P < 0.003), POLYPOID DISEASE (61.5% VS 42.3%, P < 0.05), SUBEPITHELIAL EDEMA (80.8% VS 53.1%, P < 0.006), HYPERPLASTIC/PAPILLARY CHANGES (23.1% VS 8.0%, P < 0.028), FIBROSIS (61.5% VS 38.5%, P < 0.036), EOSINOPHIL AGGREGATES (46.2% VS 24.6%, P < 0.022), AND EOSINOPHILS/HPF (>5/HPF) (65.4% VS 45.1%, P < 0.043). WHEN CONTROLLING FOR INSURANCE STATUS, BLACK RACE WAS NO LONGER ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED SNOT-22 (P < 0.104) OR EOSINOPHILS/HPF (>5/HPF) (P < 0.183). CONCLUSION: BLACK AND MEDICAID PATIENTS DEMONSTRATED MORE SEVERE DISEASE BY HISTOPATHOLOGY AND SNOT-22 SCORES. THESE FINDINGS WERE NO LONGER SIGNIFICANT AMONG BLACK PATIENTS AFTER ADJUSTING FOR INSURANCE STATUS, SUGGESTING THAT THE PREVAILING FACTOR INFLUENCING WORSE DISEASE MAY BE ACCESS TO CARE.","RUSH MEDICAL COLLEGE - RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, CHICAGO, IL, 60612.; RUSH MEDICAL COLLEGE - RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, CHICAGO, IL, 60612.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, RUSH SINUS PROGRAM, RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, CHICAGO, IL, 60612.; DEPARTMENT OF IMMUNOLOGY AND MICROBIOLOGY, ALLERGY/IMMUNOLOGY SECTION, RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, CHICAGO, IL, 60612.; DEPARTMENT OF PATHOLOGY, RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, CHICAGO, IL, 60612.; DEPARTMENT OF PATHOLOGY, RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, CHICAGO, IL, 60612.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, RUSH SINUS PROGRAM, RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, CHICAGO, IL, 60612.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, RUSH SINUS PROGRAM, RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, CHICAGO, IL, 60612.;","ORCID: 0000-0003-4276-1193 ORCID: 0000-0002-4576-2557","© 2019 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2019/02/13 06:00","20200325","20190212",2019,"2019/02/13 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"6",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.22295 [DOI]","20200325","2020/03/26 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","665-673","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"30748100","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2019 JUN;9(6):665-673.

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES: TO EVALUATE THE THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF RESLIZUMAB-HUMANIZED ANTI-IL-5 MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY FOR THE TREATMENT OF CRS WITH POLYPS IN PATIENTS WITH SEVERE ASTHMA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: WE INVESTIGATED THE CASES OF 9 PATIENTS WITH SEVERE ASTHMA TREATED WITH INTRAVENOUS RESLIZUMAB AT A DOSE OF 3 MG PER 1 KG OF WEIGHT WITH REGULARITY ONCE IN 4 WEEKS. THE PRESENCE OF CRS WITH POLYPS WAS REVEALED IN 7 OF 9 PATIENTS, SCT SCANNING OF THE PARANASAL SINUSES INDICATED CHANGES IN ALL THE PATIENTS, 2 PATIENTS HAD SYMPTOMS OF CHRONIC NON-ALLERGIC RHINITIS (NARES).THE TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS CONTROL WAS CARRIED OUT AFTER 6 MONTHS FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE TREATMENT BY THE DYNAMICS OF NASAL SYMPTOMS (SNOT-22), ENDOSCOPIC IMAGE OF THE NOSE, TOTAL POLYP SCORE (TPS), CHANGES IN THE SCT OF THE PARANASAL SINUSES ON THE LUND-MACKAY SCALE, RHINOCYTOGRAM, THE CONTENT OF EOSINOPHILIC CATIONIC PROTEIN IN THE BLOOD, THE LEVEL OF SYSTEMIC EOSINOPHILIA. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ASTHMA CONTROL WAS ASSESSED BY THE REDUCTION OF THE FREQUENCY OF ASTHMA EXACERBATIONS, THE NEED FOR SYSTEMIC CORTICOSTEROIDS, SPIROMETRY DATA AND ASTHMA CONTROL TEST (ACT) RESULTS. ALONG WITH A MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN ASTHMA CONTROL, 8 OUT OF 9 PATIENTS DISPLAYED CLINICAL, ENDOSCOPIC, RADIOLOGICAL SIGNS OF WEAKENING OF NASAL SYMPTOMS. MORE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ASTHMA CONTROL WAS ACHIEVED IN PATIENTS HAVING CRS WITH POLYPS. IN THE GROUP OF PATIENTS HAVING CRS WITH POLYPS, IT WAS POSSIBLE TO DETECT ANAMNESTIC PRESENCE OF NARES SYMPTOMS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THE DISEASE. THIS INDICATES THAT NARES CAN BE A PRECURSOR TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF EOSINOPHILIC, NON-IGE-INDUCED ASTHMA AND NASAL POLYPS. CONCLUSION: TREATMENT WITH RESLIZUMAB IN PATIENTS WITH EOSINOPHILIC ASTHMA AND CONCOMITANT CRS WITH POLYPS AND CHRONIC NON-ALLERGIC RHINITIS (NARES) LEADS NOT ONLY TO IMPROVED CONTROL OF ASTHMA SYMPTOMS, BUT ALSO TO A SIGNIFICANT REGRESSION OF NASAL SYMPTOMS.","ROSTOV STATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, ROSTOV-ON-DON, RUSSIA.; REGIONAL CONSULTATIVE AND DIAGNOSTIC CENTER, ROSTOV-ON-DON, RUSSIA.; REGIONAL CONSULTATIVE AND DIAGNOSTIC CENTER, ROSTOV-ON-DON, RUSSIA.; REGIONAL CONSULTATIVE AND DIAGNOSTIC CENTER, ROSTOV-ON-DON, RUSSIA.; REGIONAL CLINIC HOSPITAL, ROSTOV-ON-DON, RUSSIA.;","ORCID: 0000-0002-1316-5061 ORCID: 0000-0001-7401-0680",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021/04/30 11:36","20210504",NA,2021,"2021/05/01 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,"0042-4668 (PRINT) 0042-4668 (LINKING)","0416577","VESTNIK OTORINOLARINGOLOGII","RUS","10.17116/OTORINO20218602143 [DOI]","20210504","2021/05/05 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","43-48","RUSSIA (FEDERATION)",NA,NA,"33929151","PPUBLISH","0 (ANTIBODIES, MONOCLONAL, HUMANIZED) 35A26E427H (RESLIZUMAB)","IM",NA,"VESTN OTORINOLARINGOL. 2021;86(2):43-48.

ALL THE PATIENTS WERE CONSECUTIVELY RECEIVING CARE AT AN OTOLARYNGOLOGY SERVICE IN SALVADOR, BAHIA FROM AUGUST 2011 TO JUNE 2012. THE OUTCOMES OF THE SURGICAL TREATMENT OF THESE PATIENTS WERE OBTAINED FROM THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS. THE INITIAL SCORE WAS COMPARED TO A GROUP OF PATIENTS WHO WERE NOT REFERRED FOR SURGERY. ALL THE PATIENTS COMPLETED AND SIGNED A CONSENT FORM. RESULTS: OF THE 88 PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS, 26 HAD EVOLVED TO SURGERY OVER THE LAST 3 YEARS. THE GROUPS WERE HOMOGENEOUS REGARDING GENDER AND RESPIRATORY AND MEDICATION ALLERGIES. THE PATIENTS OF THE SURGICAL GROUP WERE 44.8+13.8 YEARS OLD AND THE PATIENTS OF THE CLINICAL GROUP WERE 38.2+12.5 YEARS OLD (P=0.517). THE AVERAGE SNOT-22 SCORE OF THE CASE GROUP WAS 49+19 AND THE AVERAGE SCORE OF THE CONTROL GROUP WAS 49+27 (P=0.927). CONCLUSION: THE SNOT-22 WAS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF SURGICAL PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS.","ESCOLA BAHIANA DE MEDICINA E SAÚDE PÚBLICA (BAHIANA), PROGRAMA DE PÓS-GRADUAÇÃO, SALVADOR, BA, BRAZIL.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: PABLOMARAMBAIA@HOTMAIL.;COM.; ESCOLA BAHIANA DE MEDICINA E SAÚDE PÚBLICA (BAHIANA), PROGRAMA DE PÓS-GRADUAÇÃO, SALVADOR, BA, BRAZIL; UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DA BAHIA (UFBA), SALVADOR, BA, BRAZIL.; INSTITUTO DE OTORRINOLARINGOLOGIA OTORRINOS ASSOCIADOS (INOOA), SALVADOR, BA, BRAZIL.; ESCOLA BAHIANA DE MEDICINA E SAÚDE PÚBLICA (BAHIANA), PROGRAMA DE PÓS-GRADUAÇÃO, SALVADOR, BA, BRAZIL.; SANTA CASA DE SÃO PAULO, OTORRINOLARINGOLOGIA, SÃO PAULO, SP, BRAZIL.; UNIVERSIDADE DO PORTO, BIOÉTICA, PORTO, PORTUGAL.; UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE SÃO PAULO (UNIFESP), PROGRAMA DE PÓS-GRADUAÇÃO EM OTORRINOLARINGOLOGIA, SÃO PAULO, SP, BRAZIL.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT © 2016 ASSOCIAÇÃO BRASILEIRA DE OTORRINOLARINGOLOGIA E CIRURGIA CÉRVICO-FACIAL.

METHODS: PATIENTS WITH CRS WHO FAILED MEDICAL TREATMENT WERE PROSPECTIVELY ENROLLED. ALL PATIENTS UNDERWENT PRE-OPERATIVE EXAMINATIONS AND COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES, INCLUDING THE REFLUX SYMPTOM INDEX (RSI) AND THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22). AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION WAS SCORED USING THE 31-ITEM COMPOSITE AUTONOMIC SYMPTOM SCORE (COMPASS 31), A VALIDATED SIMPLE INSTRUMENT USED TO EVALUATE DYSAUTONOMIA. RESULTS: WE PROSPECTIVELY ENROLLED A TOTAL OF 89 CRS PATIENTS, INCLUDING 37 WITH POLYPS (CRSWNP) AND 52 WITHOUT POLYPS (CRSSNP). THE MOST COMMON DYSAUTONOMIC SYMPTOMS WERE DRY EYE, DRY MOUTH, POSTURAL DIZZINESS, AND A SENSATION OF EXCESSIVE FULLNESS AFTER MEALS. SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATIONS WERE EVIDENT BETWEEN COMPASS 31 AND SNOT-22 SCORES IN CRSWNP PATIENTS. CRS-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING COUGH, POST-NASAL DRIP, SLEEP, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DYSFUNCTION, WERE CORRELATED WITH THE LEVEL OF AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION.

DUE TO ITS PATHOLOGICAL MECHANISM, CHRONIC RHINO SINUSITIS (CRS) ASSOCIATED OR NOT WITH NASAL POLYPOSIS USUALLY OCCURS IN ADULTS AND AFFECTS CLOSE TO ONE-HALF OF ALL CF PATIENTS. THE GOAL OF OUR WORK WAS TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS) IN THE QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OF THE CF PATIENTS AND DEMONSTRATE AN IMPROVEMENT OF THE FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES IN THE PATIENTS UNDERWENT THE SURGICAL PROCEDURE RATHER THAN IN THE NOT TREATED ONES, PARTICULARY IN LUNG TRANSPLANT PATIENTS. METHODS: WE STUDIED 54 ADULT PATIENTS AFFECTED BY CF. LUND-KENNEDY, LUND-MACKAY SCORES, AND SNOT-22 WERE ANALYSED. 14 HAD LUNG TRANSPLANT AND 9 HAD BOTH LUNG TRANPLANT AND ESS PROCEDURES. RESULTS: 22 (40.7%) OUT OF 54 CF PATIENTS UNDERWENT ESS. THIS GROUP PRESENTED MORE LIKELY COMPLAINTS CONSISTENT WITH CRS. LUND-KENNEDY AND LUND-MACKAY SCORES APPEARED HIGHER IN THE ESS GROUP: 10 (RANGE OF 6-12) AND 15 (RANGE OF 12-20), RESPECTIVELY. SNOT-22 SHOWED MEDIAN VALUES FOR NON-ESS AND ESS GROUP OF 20 (RANGE OF 3-68) AND 40 (RANGE OF 10-73), RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSIONS: ESS REPRESENTS THE BEST OPTION TO IMPROVE CLINICAL QOL OF CF PATIENTS WHO DO NOT RESPONSE TO CONVENTIONAL MEDICAL THERAPY, WITH A STABILIZATION OF RESPIRATORY FUNCTION AFTER TRANSPLANTATION.","DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY AND TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE, CLINIC OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, CAREGGI UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, UNIVERSITY OF FLORENCE, LARGO BRAMBILLA, 3-50134, FLORENCE, ITALY.; LUPARELLO.;PAOLO@YAHOO.;IT.; DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY AND TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE, CLINIC OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, CAREGGI UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, UNIVERSITY OF FLORENCE, LARGO BRAMBILLA, 3-50134, FLORENCE, ITALY.; DEPARTMENT OF THORACIC SURGERY, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL CAREGGI, FLORENCE, ITALY.; INFECTIOUS DISEASE DEPARTMENT, CAREGGI UNIVERSITY AND HOSPITAL, FLORENCE, ITALY.; ANNA MEYER CHILDREN'S UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, VIALE PIERACCINI 23, 50139, FLORENCE, ITALY.; DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY AND TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE, CLINIC OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, CAREGGI UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, UNIVERSITY OF FLORENCE, LARGO BRAMBILLA, 3-50134, FLORENCE, ITALY.;","ORCID: 0000-0002-1856-9372",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019/01/29 06:00","20190610","20190128",2019,"2019/01/29 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"5",NA,"1434-4726 (ELECTRONIC) 0937-4477 (LINKING)","9002937","EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY : OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN FEDERATION OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGICAL SOCIETIES (EUFOS) : AFFILIATED WITH THE GERMAN SOCIETY FOR OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY","ENG","10.1007/S00405-019-05308-9 [DOI]","20200225","2019/06/14 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","1341-1347","GERMANY",NA,NA,"30689038","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"EUR ARCH OTORHINOLARYNGOL. 2019 MAY;276(5):1341-1347.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: PATIENTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS-PATIENTS WITH CRSWNPS AND CONTROL SUBJECTS WHO HAD NASAL SURGERY FOR ANOTHER REASON BESIDE CRS. OUR ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED ACROSS THREE DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS (18-30 YEARS, 31-50 YEARS, AND 51 YEARS AND MORE). TISSUE BIOPSIES FROM THE SINUS CAVITY FOR ALL STUDY PARTICIPANTS WERE TAKEN AND FROZEN AT -80 °C, UNTIL USE. THE CONCENTRATIONS OF IL-1<U+0392>, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-13, IL-21, AND IL-22, WERE QUANTIFIED USING A MAGNETIC BEAD-BASED MULTIPLEX ASSAY. RESULTS: IN THE GROUP AGED 18-30 YEARS, THE LEVELS OF INFLAMMATORY MARKERS IL-1, IL-2, IL-5, AND IL-22 WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN PATIENTS WITH CRSWNPS THAN THE CONTROL SUBJECTS. AMONG PATIENTS AGED 31-50 YEARS, SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS OF IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, AND IL-22 WERE RECORDED IN PATIENTS WITH CRSWNPS, AS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL SUBJECTS.

METHODS: THIS WAS A RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, NONINFERIORITY TRIAL COMPARING AMOXICILLIN-CLAVULANATE VS PLACEBO AFTER ESS (NCT01919411, CLINICALTRIALS.GOV). ADULTS (N = 77) WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS) REFRACTORY TO APPROPRIATE MEDICAL THERAPY WHO UNDERWENT ESS WERE RANDOMIZED TO ANTIBIOTICS (N = 37) OR PLACEBO (N = 40) AND FOLLOWED CLINICALLY (MEAN ± STANDARD DEVIATION: 1.3 ± 0.3 AND 8.8 ± 3.9 WEEKS POSTOPERATIVELY). AT BASELINE AND FOLLOW-UP, QOL WAS MEASURED WITH 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST QUESTIONNAIRES AND LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPIC SCORES WERE EVALUATED. OUTCOMES WERE ANALYZED WITH REPEATED-MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE AND ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE AND Z TESTS FOR PROPORTIONS. RESULTS: PLACEBO WAS NONINFERIOR TO ANTIBIOTIC PROPHYLAXIS WITH REGARD TO POSTOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORES (<U+0392> = 0.18, 2-TAILED P < 0.05). THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ANTIBIOTIC AND PLACEBO GROUPS IN LK SCORE TRAJECTORIES OVER TIME (P = 0.63) OR IN POSTOPERATIVE INFECTION RATES (2.6% VS 2.4%, RESPECTIVELY; P = 0.96).

CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH STATISTICALLY UNDERPOWERED, THE RESULTS SUGGEST PLACEBO WAS NONINFERIOR TO PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS AFTER ESS FOR CRS REGARDING POSTOPERATIVE SINONASAL-SPECIFIC QOL. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN POSTOPERATIVE ENDOSCOPIC SCORES OR RATES OF INFECTION, BUT THE RATE OF DIARRHEA WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE ANTIBIOTIC GROUP.

PATIENT-PERCEIVED CRS SYMPTOM CONTROL IS A LONGITUDINAL MEASURE OF CRS SYMPTOMATOLOGY AND IS DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) IN PATIENTS WITH CRS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SYMPTOM CONTROL AND PRODUCTIVITY LOSS IN CRS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PROSPECTIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL COHORT STUDY OF 200 PATIENTS WITH CRS. PATIENTS CATEGORIZED THEIR CRS SYMPTOM CONTROL AS \"NOT AT ALL\", \"A LITTLE\", \"SOMEWHAT\", \"VERY\", AND \"COMPLETELY\". LOST PRODUCTIVITY WAS ASSESSED BY DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF WORK AND/OR SCHOOL DAYS MISSED IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS DUE TO CRS SYMPTOMS. SINONASAL SYMPTOM SEVERITY WAS MEASURED USING THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOMES TEST (SNOT-22). ASSOCIATIONS WERE SOUGHT BETWEEN LOST PRODUCTIVITY AND PATIENT-PERCEIVED CRS SYMPTOM CONTROL. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PATIENT-PERCEIVED LONGITUDINAL SYMPTOM CONTROL AND PRODUCTIVITY IN PATIENTS WITH CRS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 200 PARTICIPANTS (48% MALE, 52% FEMALE), WITH A MEAN AGE OF 52 YEARS (STANDARD DEVIATION [SD]: 16) WERE ENROLLED. THE MEAN SNOT-22 SCORE OF PARTICIPANTS WAS 33.5 (SD: 22.4). PARTICIPANTS MISSED A MEAN OF 3 DAYS (SD: 10) OF WORK OR SCHOOL DUE TO CRS. CRS SYMPTOM CONTROL CLASSIFIED AS \"NOT AT ALL\" WAS ASSOCIATED WITH 11 DAYS OF LOST PRODUCTIVITY DUE TO CRS ON UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS (<U+0392>=11.16, 95% CI: 5.39-16.94, P<0.001) AND 8 DAYS OF LOST PRODUCTIVITY ON MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS (<U+0392>=8.02, 95% CI: 1.92-14.13, P=0.011). NONE OF THE OTHER CATEGORIES OF PATIENT-REPORTED CRS SYMPTOM CONTROL WERE ASSOCIATED WITH LOST PRODUCTIVITY DUE TO CRS. CONCLUSIONS: PATIENT-PERCEIVED CONTROL OF CRS SYMPTOMS, AN IMPORTANT METRIC PREVIOUSLY SHOWN TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH QOL IN CRS PATIENTS, IS INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH LOST PRODUCTIVITY.

METHODS: PATIENTS WITH SEVERE CRS WHO UNDERWENT FESS AT A TERTIARY CARE REFERRAL CENTER BETWEEN MAY AND OCTOBER 2017 WERE PROSPECTIVELY ENROLLED. THE CONSENSUS AUDITORY-PERCEPTUAL EVALUATION OF VOICE (CAPE-V) AND THE VOICE HANDICAP INDEX (VHI) WERE USED TO QUANTITATIVELY EVALUATE VOICE CHARACTERISTICS AND QUALITY OF LIFE, RESPECTIVELY. PREOPERATIVE AND POSTOPERATIVE CAPE-V AND VHI SCORES WERE COMPARED WITH POSTOPERATIVE SCORES FOR EACH PATIENT.

OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER DEPRESSED MOOD WOULD AFFECT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CRS SYMPTOM BURDEN AND DECREASED GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL. METHODS: FOR THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY, 610 PARTICIPANTS WITH CRS WERE PROSPECTIVELY RECRUITED. CRS SYMPTOM BURDEN WAS MEASURED WITH THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL WAS MEASURED WITH THE EUROQOL 5-DIMENSIONAL HEALTH UTILITY VALUE (EQ-5D HUV) AND VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (EQ-5D VAS). DEPRESSED MOOD WAS MEASURED USING THE PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE-2 (PHQ-2). PARTICIPANTS WERE STRATIFIED AS HAVING WELL-CONTROLLED CRS SYMPTOMS (SNOT-22 < 35) AND POORLY CONTROLLED CRS SYMPTOMS (SNOT-22 = 35). GOOD GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL WAS DETERMINED AS EQ-5D HUV = 0.9 OR EQ-5D VAS = 80, IN CONTRAST TO LOW GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL. RESULTS: IN PARTICIPANTS WITH WELL-CONTROLLED CRS SYMPTOMS, BOTH SNOT-22 AND PHQ-2 WERE SIGNIFICANTLY AND NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH GOOD GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL (P < .020 IN ALL CASES USING MULTIVARIABLE REGRESSION). IN PARTICIPANTS WITH POORLY CONTROLLED CRS SYMPTOMS, THE PHQ-2 WAS SIGNIFICANTLY AND NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH GOOD GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL USING THE EQ-5D HUV (ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO [OR] = 0.37, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI]: 0.22-0.62, P < .001) OR THE EQ-5D VAS (ADJUSTED OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.57-0.96, P = .024). IN CONTRAST, SNOT-22 WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL IN THESE PATIENTS. CONCLUSIONS: DEPRESSED MOOD MODULATES THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN CRS SYMPTOM BURDEN AND GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST A THRESHOLD OF CRS SYMPTOM BURDEN OR CONTROL, BEYOND WHICH DEPRESSED MOOD-NOT CRS SYMPTOM BURDEN-DRIVES THE ASSOCIATION WITH GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL.","WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, DETROIT, MICH; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASS; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, BOSTON, MASS.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASS; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, BOSTON, MASS.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASS; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, BOSTON, MASS.; DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY, MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASS.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, BOSTON, MASS; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER, BOSTON, MASS.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASS; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, BOSTON, MASS.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASS; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, BOSTON, MASS; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER, BOSTON, MASS; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY AND COMMUNICATIONS ENHANCEMENT, BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, BOSTON, MASS.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: AHMAD_SEDAGHAT@MEEI.;HARVARD.;EDU.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT © 2018 AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGY.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO SUMMARIZE THE CURRENT DEFINITIONS AND EVALUATION PARAMETERS OF AE AND THEN IDENTIFY AND QUANTIFY THE CLINICAL AND IMMUNOPATHOLOGIC CHARACTERISTICS OF AE IN CRS. METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE WAS PERFORMED ON PUBMED, SCOPUS, AND COCHRANE DATABASES FROM JANUARY 1990 THROUGH AUGUST 2020 TO IDENTIFY STUDIES RELATING TO AE IN CRS. EXCLUSION CRITERIA INCLUDED NON-ENGLISH AND NON-HUMAN STUDIES, AND CASE REPORTS. RESULTS: THE DEFINITIONS OF AE IN CRS AMONG ALL THE STUDIES WERE BASED ON A DESCRIPTION OF SHORT-TERM WORSENING SINONASAL SYMPTOMS. PATIENT-REPORTED SINUS INFECTION AND EXACERBATION RELATED MEDICAL TREATMENT DURING THE PRECEDING 3 MONTHS TO 1 YEAR WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE FREQUENCY OF AE IN CRS. THE AVERAGE DECLINE IN 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORE DURING AN EXACERBATION WAS 7.83 POINTS RELATIVE TO BASELINE. COMORBID ASTHMA, SNOT-22 SCORES =24, ALLERGIC RHINITIS, EOSINOPHIL COUNT =150/<U+039C>L AND AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE WERE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXACERBATION-PRONE CRS PHENOTYPE. AE IN CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITH NASAL POLYPS (CRSWNP) WAS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED EXPRESSION OF MUCUS CYTOKINES INCLUDING MYELOPEROXIDASE (PERCENTAGE INCREASE [PI] = 101%), IL-5 (PI = 125%), AND IL-6 (PI = 162%) AND COULD BE PREDICTED BY THE INCREASING MUCUS CYSTATIN AND PERIOSTIN. CONCLUSION: THE DEFINITION OF AE IN CRS IS LARGELY DRIVEN BY PATIENT-REPORTED SYMPTOMS AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERAL RISK FACTORS. QUANTITATIVE CHANGES IN MUCUS CYTOKINES ASSOCIATED WITH AE IN CRSWNP AND MAY BE USED TO PREDICT EVENTS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CONSISTENT DEFINITION OF AE IN CRS IS CRITICAL TO HELP DEFINE DISEASE CONTROL AND TREATMENT EFFICACY.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, BEIJING ANZHEN HOSPITAL, CAPITAL MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, ANZHEN ROAD 2, CHAOYANG DISTRICT, BEIJING, 100029, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, 243 CHARLES STREET, BOSTON, MA, 02114, USA.; BENJAMIN_BLEIER@MEEI.;HARVARD.;EDU.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, BEIJING ANZHEN HOSPITAL, CAPITAL MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, ANZHEN ROAD 2, CHAOYANG DISTRICT, BEIJING, 100029, CHINA.; YONGXW67@163.;COM.;","ORCID: 0000-0003-4888-3255",NA,NA,NA,"THE AUTHORS DECLARE THAT THEY HAVE NO COMPETING INTERESTS.","2020/08/20 06:00","20210816","20200818",2020,"2020/08/20 06:00",NA,NA,"81670903/NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA/ 2018-2-2065/CAPITAL HEALTH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIAL FUND/ BZ0377/BEIJING KEY LABORATORY OF UPPER AIRWAY DYSFUNCTION RELATED CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES/ QML20190617/BEIJING HOSPITALS AUTHORITY YOUTH PROGRAMME/","1",NA,"1916-0216 (ELECTRONIC) 1916-0208 (PRINT) 1916-0208 (LINKING)","101479544","JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD & NECK SURGERY = LE JOURNAL D'OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGIE ET DE CHIRURGIE CERVICO-FACIALE","ENG","10.1186/S40463-020-00459-W [DOI] 62","20210816","2021/08/17 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","62",NA,"PMC7436990",NA,"32811568","EPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"J OTOLARYNGOL HEAD NECK SURG. 2020 AUG 18;49(1):62.

THE MEAN (± STANDARD DEVIATION [SD]) DURATION SINCE LAST MMT WAS 144 (±36 DAYS). OF THE 130 PATIENTS, 52 SELECTED CNSI, 16 PSI, 19 RMMT, AND 43 ESS. MEAN SNOT-22 SCORES BEFORE TREATMENT DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER BETWEEN TREATMENTS (P = .99). OVERALL, SNOT-22 SCORES DECREASED FROM 38 ± 2 BEFORE TREATMENT TO 20 ± 2 AFTER 1 YEAR (P < .001), WITH A HIGHER REDUCTION FOR PATIENTS HAVING CRS WITH NASAL POLYPS THAN FOR THOSE WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS (35 ± 2 TO 15 ± 2 VS 41 ± 3 TO 25 ± 4, RESPECTIVELY; BOTH P < .001). OVERALL, NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE 3 MEDICAL TREATMENTS WAS OBSERVED (ALL P > .2). POST-TREATMENT SCORES FOLLOWING ESS (19 ± 2) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN FOR EACH OF THE 3 MEDICAL TREATMENTS (CNSI 26 ± 2, P = .004; PSI 27 ± 3, P = .026; RMMT 28 ± 3, P = .008). AT 1 YEAR FOLLOWING ESS, 26 OF 31 PATIENTS WERE ASYMPTOMATIC AND DID NOT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL SYSTEMIC STEROIDS, COMPARED TO 25 OF 50 PATIENTS FOLLOWING MEDICAL TREATMENT (P = .002). THE INVESTIGATED STANDARDIZED TREATMENTS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED SNOT-22 SCORES IN PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY CRS UNDER REAL-WORLD CONDITIONS. BOTH PATIENTS HAVING CRS WITH AND THOSE WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SNOT-22 SCORES, ALTHOUGH A LESS PROFOUND EFFECT WAS FOUND AMONG THE LATTER GROUP. PATIENTS WHO SELECTED ESS WERE LESS SYMPTOMATIC DURING THE FIRST FOLLOW-UP YEAR THAN PATIENTS WHO SELECTED MEDICAL TREATMENT ALONE. PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY CRS DID NOT BENEFIT FROM AN ADDITIONAL COURSE OF MMT IN COMPARISON TO THOSE WHO WERE TREATED ONLY WITH CNSI.","DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, 27280MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF INNSBRUCK, INNSBRUCK, AUSTRIA.; DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY, PSYCHOTHERAPY AND PSYCHOSOMATICS, 27280MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF INNSBRUCK, INNSBRUCK, AUSTRIA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, 27280MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF INNSBRUCK, INNSBRUCK, AUSTRIA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, 27280MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF INNSBRUCK, INNSBRUCK, AUSTRIA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, 27280MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF INNSBRUCK, INNSBRUCK, AUSTRIA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, 27280MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF INNSBRUCK, INNSBRUCK, AUSTRIA.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019/07/04 06:00","20210902","20190702",2021,"2019/07/04 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,"1942-7522 (ELECTRONIC) 0145-5613 (LINKING)","7701817","EAR, NOSE, & THROAT JOURNAL","ENG","10.1177/0145561319849421 [DOI]","20210902","2021/09/03 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","NP77-NP86","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"31266398","PPUBLISH","0 (STEROIDS)","IM",NA,"EAR NOSE THROAT J. 2021 FEB;100(2):NP77-NP86.

ITS APPLICATION IN TREATMENT OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS HAS NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY STUDIED. THIS STUDY ASSESSES THE SUBJECTIVE AND CLINICAL RESPONSE TO BUDESONIDE BUFFERED HYPERTONIC SALINE NASAL IRRIGATION AND HYPERTONIC SALINE NASAL IRRIGATION IN PATIENTS WITH ALLERGIC RHINITIS. STUDY DESIGN: THIS IS A PROSPECTIVE, SINGLE-CENTER, DOUBLE-BLIND, RANDOMIZED PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: TERTIARY CARE HOSPITAL. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: FIFTY-TWO PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH ALLERGIC RHINITIS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO 2 GROUPS TO RECEIVE EITHER BUFFERED HYPERTONIC SALINE NASAL IRRIGATION WITH A PLACEBO RESPULE OR BUFFERED HYPERTONIC SALINE NASAL IRRIGATION WITH A BUDESONIDE RESPULE. PATIENTS WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND 4 WEEKS SUBJECTIVELY USING THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22) QUESTIONNAIRE AND VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS). CLINICAL ASSESSMENT WAS DONE USING THE MODIFIED LUND-KENNEDY SCORE. RESULTS: THE AVERAGE SNOT-22, VAS, AND MODIFIED LUND-KENNEDY SCORES IMPROVED IN BOTH GROUPS (P < .001). THE BUDESONIDE IRRIGATION GROUP WAS FOUND TO HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER IMPROVEMENT THAN THE SALINE NASAL IRRIGATION GROUP WITH THE SNOT-22 SCORES (P = .012) AND VAS SCORES (P = .007). HOWEVER, THE DIFFERENCE IN THE CLINICAL RESPONSE BETWEEN THE 2 GROUPS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT (P = .268). CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY ADDS EVIDENCE TO THE USE OF SALINE NASAL IRRIGATION IN ALLERGIC RHINITIS BUT ALSO DEMONSTRATES EFFICACY OF THE ADDITION OF BUDESONIDE TO IRRIGATIONS. BUDESONIDE NASAL IRRIGATION THUS APPEARS TO BE A VIABLE TREATMENT OPTION FOR ALLERGIC RHINITIS.","OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, KASTURBA MEDICAL COLLEGE, MANIPAL ACADEMY OF HIGHER EDUCATION, MANIPAL, KARNATAKA, INDIA.; OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, KASTURBA MEDICAL COLLEGE, MANIPAL ACADEMY OF HIGHER EDUCATION, MANIPAL, KARNATAKA, INDIA.; OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, KASTURBA MEDICAL COLLEGE, MANIPAL ACADEMY OF HIGHER EDUCATION, MANIPAL, KARNATAKA, INDIA.; OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE, CALIFORNIA, USA.; OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, KASTURBA MEDICAL COLLEGE, MANIPAL ACADEMY OF HIGHER EDUCATION, MANIPAL, KARNATAKA, INDIA.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020/05/13 06:00","20200706","20200512",2020,"2020/05/13 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"6",NA,"1097-6817 (ELECTRONIC) 0194-5998 (LINKING)","8508176","OTOLARYNGOLOGY--HEAD AND NECK SURGERY : OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF AMERICAN ACADEMY OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY","ENG","10.1177/0194599820919363 [DOI]","20200706","2020/07/07 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","979-984","ENGLAND",NA,NA,"32393099","PPUBLISH","0 (GLUCOCORTICOIDS) 0 (SALINE SOLUTION) 51333-22-3 (BUDESONIDE)","IM",NA,"OTOLARYNGOL HEAD NECK SURG. 2020 JUN;162(6):979-984.

OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE PATTERNS OF SYMPTOMS AND HRQL DISEASE-SPECIFIC DOMAINS AFFECTED IN PATIENTS WITH CRS BY COMPARING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TWO CLINICAL PHENOTYPES, ADJUSTED FOR DEMOGRAPHICS, MAJOR RISK FACTORS, COMORBIDITIES, CURRENT MEDICAL TREATMENT, AND PREVIOUS SURGERY. METHODS: A GROUP OF 251 PATIENTS WITH CRS COMPLETED THE VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS) SYMPTOM SEVERITY SCORE AND THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST 22 (SNOT-22) QUESTIONNAIRE. DATA SETS WERE ANALYZED BY USING PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA) TO IDENTIFY A SET OF SYMPTOM COMPONENTS, TOGETHER WITH THE ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM PCA, WHICH WERE THEN ANALYZED FOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PATIENTS WITH CRS WITH NASAL POLYPS (CRSWNP) AND PATIENTS WITH CRS WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS (CRSSNP). RESULTS: PCA OF SNOT-22 ITEMS IDENTIFIED SIX COMPONENTS, THREE REFERRED TO CRS-SPECIFIC SYMPTOMS TERMED \"NASAL\"; \"EXTRANASAL, RHINOLOGIC\"; AND \"OLFACTORY/COUGH\"; AND THREE REFERRED TO HRQL IMPAIRMENT TERMED \"SLEEP DISTURBANCE,\" \"FUNCTIONAL DISTURBANCE,\" AND \"EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE.\" NASAL OBSTRUCTION, EAR PAIN, EAR FULLNESS, AND FATIGUE WERE EXCLUDED FROM PCA AND TREATED AS SEPARATE OUTCOMES. PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE NASAL SYMPTOMS, OLFACTORY/COUGH SYMPTOMS, AND NASAL OBSTRUCTION. PATIENTS WITH CRSSNP SCORED SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE WITH REGARD TO FATIGUE AND TO SLEEP AND FUNCTIONAL DISTURBANCES. THE PCA RESULTS FOR VAS SCORES IDENTIFIED THREE SYMPTOM COMPONENTS: PAIN, NASAL SYMPTOMS, AND PHARYNGEAL SYMPTOMS. PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE VAS NASAL SYMPTOMS BUT LESS PRONOUNCED VAS PAIN SYMPTOMS THAN PATIENTS WITH CRSSNP. THE TOTAL SNOT-22 SCORE BETWEEN THE GROUPS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT.

SETTING TERTIARY ACADEMIC RHINOLOGY CLINIC. SUBJECTS AND METHODS IN TOTAL, 350 PARTICIPANTS WITH CRS WERE RECRUITED AND 28.3% WERE ASTHMATIC. CRS-SPECIFIC QOL WAS MEASURED USING THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). ASTHMA CONTROL WAS ASSESSED WITH THE ASTHMA CONTROL TEST (ACT). GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL WAS ASSESSED WITH THE EUROQOL 5-DIMENSIONAL GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE SURVEY VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (EQ-5D VAS). ASSOCIATIONS WERE SOUGHT BETWEEN SNOT-22 AND EQ-5D VAS (DEPENDENT VARIABLES) AND ASTHMA (INDEPENDENT VARIABLE), WHILE CONTROLLING FOR ACT. ACT SCORE FOR PATIENTS WITH CRS WITHOUT ASTHMA WAS SET AT 25 (INDICATING COMPLETELY CONTROLLED, ASYMPTOMATIC ASTHMA). RESULTS COMORBID ASTHMA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SNOT-22 (<U+0392> = 11.8; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], 6.2-17.3; P < .001) AND EQ-5D VAS (<U+0392> = -6.2; 95% CI, -11.2 TO -1.3; P = .014). AFTER CONTROLLING FOR ACT, ASTHMA WAS NO LONGER ASSOCIATED WITH SNOT-22 ( P = .147) OR EQ-5D VAS ( P = .994). INSTEAD, ACT SCORE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SNOT-22 (<U+0392> = -2.1; 95% CI, -3.2 TO -1.1; P < .001) AND EQ-5D VAS (<U+0392> = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1 TO 3.0; P < .001).

AN ADDITIONAL QUESTION THAT NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED IS WHETHER THERE IS A CORRELATION BETWEEN PATIENTS AT THE AGE OF RELAPSE. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL: A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY OF 150 SUBJECTS [96 MALES, 54 FEMALES, MEAN AGE: 51.99 ± (15.73)]. THE SNOT-22 AND NOSE QUESTIONNAIRES WERE USED TO MEASURE THE PATIENTS' QOL AND THEIR NASAL BLOCKAGE SYMPTOMS, RESPECTIVELY. ENDOSCOPIC AND COMPUTERIZED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) SCORES DEPICTED THE OBJECTIVE FINDINGS. RESULTS: FOLLOWING ESS, THE ENDOSCOPIC SCALE SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN 83.85% OF PATIENTS. QOL MEASURED WITH SNOT-22 IMPROVED BY 78.85% AND WITH NOSE SCALE BY 92.10%. ALSO, A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN NOSE, SNOT-22 AND THE LUND-KENNEDY SCALE. RECURRENCE WAS OBSERVED IN 13 PATIENTS DURING FOLLOW-UP. THERE WAS NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION BETWEEN AGE, GENDER, SMOKING AND RECURRENCE TENDENCY. PATIENTS WITH BASELINE SNOT-22 AND NOSE SCORES LOWER THAN 30 TYPICALLY FAIL TO OBTAIN A CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL BENEFIT. PATIENTS WITH A RATE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 40 ACHIEVED A MINIMAL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE (MCID) OF 83.9% AND HAD AN AVERAGE SYMPTOM REDUCTION (RI) RATE OF 60.3%. CONCLUSIONS: ESS IS AN IMPORTANT TREATMENT OPTION FOR SYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP AND CRSSNP. BOTH OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE MEASUREMENTS INCLUDING QOL IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY, AND THE RESULTS STABILIZED AT 12 TO 18 MONTHS. THE NOSE SCALE IS A SENSITIVE OUTCOME MEASURE IN THE CRS POPULATION, INCLUDING SUBJECTS WITH AND WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS.

ALTHOUGH THE OUTCOMES OF ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS) ON COMORBID ASTHMA HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY WELL STUDIED, THE OUTCOMES OF ESS ON COMORBID BRONCHIECTASIS HAVE RARELY BEEN EXAMINED. OBJECTIVE WE SOUGHT TO DETERMINE SINONASAL AND PULMONARY CLINICAL OUTCOMES OF ESS IN BRONCHIECTASIS PATIENTS WITH CRS. METHOD WE REVIEWED ALL BRONCHIECTASIS PATIENTS WHO HAD ESS FOR CRS AT OUR INSTITUTION FROM 2006 TO PRESENT. THE SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST 22 (SNOT-22) WAS ADMINISTERED PREOPERATIVELY AND AT 3 MONTHS, 1 YEAR, AND 3 YEARS POSTOPERATIVELY. PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS (PFTS) WERE MEASURED PREOPERATIVELY AND AT 6 MONTHS AND 1 YEAR POST OPERATION TO ASSESS THE FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 S (FEV1), FORCED VIRAL CAPACITY (FVC), AND FEV1/FVC VALUES. PAIRED T TEST AND PEARSON CORRELATION WERE USED TO COMPARE PRE- AND POSTSURGICAL RESULTS. RESULTS A TOTAL OF 141 BRONCHIECTASIS PATIENTS WHO HAD ESS FOR CRS WERE STUDIED. THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF BRONCHIECTASIS WAS CYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF) (42.55%). SNOT-22 SCORES IMPROVED AT 3 MONTHS POST OPERATION AND WERE MAINTAINED AT 1 YEAR AND 3 YEARS POST OPERATION ( P < .001). ALL SNOT SUB-DOMAINS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT AFTER SURGERY ( P < .01). HOWEVER, PFTS DID NOT CHANGE AT 6 MONTHS POST OPERATION AND 1 YEAR POST OPERATION ( P > .05). THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE OUTCOMES IN CF VERSUS NON-CF PATIENTS ( P < .05) BUT NOT BY SEX OR AGE. CONCLUSION ESS IS EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING LONG-TERM SINONASAL OUTCOMES IN BRONCHIECTASIS PATIENTS WITH CRS.

INTERVENTIONS: ALL STUDY PARTICIPANTS WERE PROVIDED WITH A SINUS RINSE KIT INCLUDING SALINE AND IDENTICAL-APPEARING CAPSULES THAT CONTAINED EITHER BUDESONIDE (TREATMENT GROUP) OR LACTOSE (CONTROL GROUP). PATIENTS WERE INSTRUCTED TO DISSOLVE THE CAPSULES IN THE SALINE AND USE THE RESULTING SOLUTION TO IRRIGATE BOTH NASAL CAVITIES, USING HALF THE SOLUTION FOR EACH CAVITY, ONCE DAILY FOR 30 DAYS. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS THE CHANGE IN SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES, PRETREATMENT TO POSTTREATMENT, IN THE BUDESONIDE GROUP COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED PATIENT-REPORTED RESPONSE TO TREATMENT, AS MEASURED WITH A MODIFICATION OF THE CLINICAL GLOBAL IMPRESSIONS SCALE, AND ENDOSCOPIC EXAMINATION SCORED BY THE LUND-KENNEDY GRADING SYSTEM. RESULTS: OF THE 74 PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED BASELINE ASSESSMENTS (37 IN EACH STUDY ARM), MEAN (SD) AGE, 51 (14.7) YEARS, 50 (68%) WERE WOMEN. OF THE 61 WHO REMAINED IN THE TRIAL TO COMPLETE ALL ANALYSES, 29 WERE RANDOMIZED TO BUDESONIDE TREATMENT, AND 32 TO SALINE ALONE. THE AVERAGE CHANGE IN SNOT-22 SCORES WAS 20.7 POINTS FOR THOSE IN THE BUDESONIDE GROUP AND 13.6 POINTS FOR THOSE IN THE CONTROL GROUP, FOR A MEAN DIFFERENCE OF 7 POINTS IN FAVOR OF THE BUDESONIDE GROUP (95% CI, -2 TO 16). A TOTAL OF 23 PARTICIPANTS (79%) IN THE BUDESONIDE GROUP EXPERIENCED A CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL REDUCTION IN THEIR SNOT-22 SCORES COMPARED WITH 19 (59%) IN THE CONTROL GROUP, FOR A DIFFERENCE OF 20% (95% CI, -2.5% TO 42.5%). THE AVERAGE CHANGE IN ENDOSCOPIC SCORES WAS 3.4 POINTS FOR THE BUDESONIDE GROUP AND 2.7 POINTS FOR THE CONTROL GROUP. THERE WERE NO RELATED ADVERSE EVENTS. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT BUDESONIDE IN SALINE NASAL LAVAGE RESULTS IN CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL BENEFITS BEYOND THE BENEFITS OF SALINE ALONE FOR PATIENTS WITH CRS. GIVEN THE IMPRECISION IN THE TREATMENT EFFECT, FURTHER RESEARCH IS WARRANTED TO DEFINE THE TRUE EFFECT OF BUDESONIDE IN SALINE NASAL LAVAGE.

WE COMPARED THE EFFECTS OF NASAL IRRIGATION WITH BUDESONIDE AND NORMAL SALINE IN CRS PATIENTS AFTER ESS. METHODS: SIXTY CRS PATIENTS WHO HAD UNDERGONE ESS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO AN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (30 PATIENTS), WHICH USED BUDESONIDE NASAL IRRIGATION, AND A CONTROL GROUP (30 PATIENTS), WHICH USED NORMAL SALINE NASAL IRRIGATION. ALL PATIENTS RECEIVED REGULAR FOLLOW-UP EVALUATIONS AND WERE ASSESSED VIA QUESTIONNAIRES, INCLUDING THE LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPIC SCORE (LKES), THE SYMPTOM VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS), THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), THE SHORT-FORM 36-ITEM QUESTIONNAIRE (SF-36), THE SELF-RATING ANXIETY SCALE (SAS), THE SELF-RATING DEPRESSION SCALE (SDS) AND A SIDE EFFECTS SCALE. RESULTS: SCORES OF POLYPOSIS, MUCOSAL EDEMA, SECRETIONS AND TOTAL SCORE OF LKES; VAS SCORES OF NASAL BLOCKAGE, HYPOSMIA AND RHINORRHEA; AND SNOT-22 RESULTS IN BOTH GROUPS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED 3 MONTHS AFTER ESS. SCORES OF POLYPOSIS, MUCOSAL EDEMA, SECRETIONS AND SCARRING AND TOTAL SCORE OF LKES IN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WERE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN IN CONTROL GROUP 3 MONTHS AFTER ESS. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN SF-36, SAS OR SDS BEFORE OR 3 MONTHS AFTER ESS WITHIN OR BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. THE SIDE EFFECTS OF THE TWO GROUPS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT.

THE EXHALATION DELIVERY SYSTEM WITH FLUTICASONE (EDS-FLU) MAY IMPROVE CARE BY INCREASING SUPERIOR/POSTERIOR INTRANASAL CORTICOSTEROID DEPOSITION. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF EDS-FLU VERSUS EDS-PLACEBO IN PATIENTS WITH NASAL POLYPS (NP). COPRIMARY END POINTS WERE CHANGE IN NASAL CONGESTION AND POLYP GRADE. KEY SECONDARY END POINTS WERE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22) AND MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY SLEEP SCALE-REVISED (MOS SLEEP-R). OTHER PRESPECIFIED END POINTS INCLUDED ALL 4 CARDINAL SYMPTOMS OF NP, 36-ITEM SHORT FORM HEALTH SURVEY (SF-36), PATIENT GLOBAL IMPRESSION OF CHANGE (PGIC), RHINOSINUSITIS DISABILITY INDEX (RSDI), AND KEY INDICATORS FOR SURGICAL INTERVENTION. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND, EDS-PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, MULTICENTER STUDY. METHODS: THREE HUNDRED TWENTY-THREE SUBJECTS WITH NP AND MODERATE-SEVERE CONGESTION/OBSTRUCTION, MOST WITH HISTORY OF CORTICOSTEROID USE (94.4%) AND/OR PRIOR SURGERY (60.4%), WERE RANDOMIZED TO EDS-FLU 93 µG, 186 µG, OR 372 µG OR EDS-PLACEBO TWICE DAILY (BID) FOR 24 WEEKS (16 DOUBLE-BLIND + 8 SINGLE-ARM EXTENSION WITH EDS-FLU 372 µG BID). RESULTS: ALL EDS-FLU DOSES PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BOTH COPRIMARY END POINTS ( P < .05) AND IN SNOT-22 TOTAL SCORE ( P = .005). EDS-FLU SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED ALL 4 CARDINAL SYMPTOMS OF NP ( P < .05), INCLUDING CONGESTION/OBSTRUCTION, FACIAL PAIN/PRESSURE, RHINORRHEA/POST-NASAL DRIP, AND HYPOSMIA/ANOSMIA.

CRS SYMPTOM BURDEN WAS ASSESSED WITH THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE WAS ASSESSED WITH THE VISUAL ANALOG SCALE OF THE 5-DIMENSIONAL EUROQOL QUESTIONNAIRE (EQ-5D VAS). PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO RATE THEIR CRS SYMPTOM CONTROL AS \"NOT AT ALL,\" \"A LITTLE,\" \"SOMEWHAT,\" \"VERY,\" AND \"COMPLETELY.\" \"NOT AT ALL,\" \"A LITTLE,\" AND \"SOMEWHAT\" CONTROLLED SYMPTOMS WERE CONSIDERED TO REFLECT POORLY CONTROLLED SYMPTOMS.

THIS STUDY ANALYZES SYMPTOM PROFILES OF SUCH PATIENTS TO HELP IDENTIFY THOSE WHO MAY BENEFIT FROM POLYSOMNOGRAPHY. METHODS: THIS IS A 2-YEAR RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF ADULT PATIENTS AT AN ACADEMIC PRACTICE WITH A RHINOLOGIC CHIEF COMPLAINT. RESULTS OF THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOMES TEST (SNOT-22) WERE COMPARED BETWEEN PATIENTS WITH UNTREATED OSA WITHOUT CRS (OSA GROUP) AND A CONTROL GROUP OF CRS PATIENTS (CRS GROUP). UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS WITH BONFERRONI CORRECTION AND MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION WERE USED. RESULTS: FORTY-ONE PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE OSA GROUP (MEAN APNEA-HYPOPNEA INDEX = 28.8, SD = 21.0) AND 124 PATIENTS IN THE CRS GROUP. CRS GROUP DEMONSTRATED HIGHER SCORES IN NASAL, EXTRA-NASAL, AND EAR/FACIAL SYMPTOM DOMAINS (P < .001), WHILE OSA GROUP DISPLAYED HIGHER PSYCHOLOGICAL (P = .020) AND SLEEP DOMAIN SCORES (P = .048). NASAL DISCHARGE (P < .001) AND LOSS OF SMELL/TASTE (P = .004) SCORES WERE HIGHER IN CRS GROUP, WHEREAS FACIAL PAIN (P = .285) AND NASAL OBSTRUCTION (P = .822) WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT. ON LOGISTIC REGRESSION, THICK NASAL DISCHARGE, LOSS OF SMELL/TASTE, AND EAR PAIN WERE PREDICTIVE OF CRS, WHILE WAKING UP TIRED WAS PREDICTIVE OF OSA. FINALLY, OSA GROUP WAS MORE LIKELY TO CHOOSE A SLEEP-RELATED ISSUE AS A MOST IMPORTANT SYMPTOM (MIS) (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: OSA AND CRS HAVE SIGNIFICANT OVERLAP IN SYMPTOM PROFILES. THE SNOT-22 CAN HELP IDENTIFY THOSE WITH UNDIAGNOSED OSA. OSA SHOULD BE SUSPECTED IN PATIENTS WHO REPORT A SLEEP-RELATED ITEM AS A MIS AND DISPLAY HIGHER PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SLEEP DOMAIN SCORES.","1 DUKE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, DURHAM, NC, USA.; 2 DUKE CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE INSTITUTE FOR BIOSTATISTICS, EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RESEARCH DESIGN (BERD) METHODS CORE, DUKE UNIVERSITY, DURHAM, NC, USA.; 2 DUKE CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE INSTITUTE FOR BIOSTATISTICS, EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RESEARCH DESIGN (BERD) METHODS CORE, DUKE UNIVERSITY, DURHAM, NC, USA.; 3 DIVISION OF HEAD AND NECK SURGERY & COMMUNICATION SCIENCES, DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, DUKE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, DURHAM, NC, USA.; 3 DIVISION OF HEAD AND NECK SURGERY & COMMUNICATION SCIENCES, DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, DUKE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, DURHAM, NC, USA.; 3 DIVISION OF HEAD AND NECK SURGERY & COMMUNICATION SCIENCES, DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, DUKE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, DURHAM, NC, USA.;","ORCID: 0000-0003-4702-466X",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019/05/24 06:00","20190923","20190522",2019,"2019/05/24 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"10",NA,"1943-572X (ELECTRONIC) 0003-4894 (LINKING)","0407300","THE ANNALS OF OTOLOGY, RHINOLOGY, AND LARYNGOLOGY","ENG","10.1177/0003489419851527 [DOI]","20190923","2019/09/24 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","963-969","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"31117803","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"ANN OTOL RHINOL LARYNGOL. 2019 OCT;128(10):963-969.

UNFORTUNATELY, THESE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS HAVE LITTLE CORRELATION WITH SYMPTOM SEVERITY OR TREATMENT OUTCOMES. UNSUPERVISED CLUSTERING CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY PHENOTYPIC SUBGROUPS OF CRS PATIENTS, DESCRIBE CLINICAL DIFFERENCES IN THESE CLUSTERS AND DEFINE SIMPLE ALGORITHMS FOR CLASSIFICATION. METHODS: A MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL, PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF 382 PATIENTS WITH CRS WHO HAD FAILED INITIAL MEDICAL THERAPY COMPLETED THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), RHINOSINUSITIS DISABILITY INDEX (RSDI), MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY SHORT FORM-12 (SF-12), PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI), AND PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE (PHQ-2). OBJECTIVE MEASURES OF CRS SEVERITY INCLUDED BRIEF SMELL IDENTIFICATION TEST (B-SIT), CT, AND ENDOSCOPY SCORING. ALL VARIABLES WERE REDUCED AND UNSUPERVISED HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING WAS PERFORMED. AFTER CLUSTERS WERE DEFINED, VARIATIONS IN MEDICATION USAGE WERE ANALYZED. DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED TO DEVELOP A SIMPLIFIED, CLINICALLY USEFUL ALGORITHM FOR CLUSTERING. RESULTS: CLUSTERING WAS LARGELY DETERMINED BY AGE, SEVERITY OF PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOME MEASURES, DEPRESSION, AND FIBROMYALGIA. CT AND ENDOSCOPY VARIED SOMEWHAT AMONG CLUSTERS. TRADITIONAL CLINICAL MEASURES, INCLUDING POLYP/ATOPIC STATUS, PRIOR SURGERY, B-SIT AND ASTHMA, DID NOT VARY AMONG CLUSTERS. A SIMPLIFIED ALGORITHM BASED UPON PRODUCTIVITY LOSS, SNOT-22 SCORE, AND AGE PREDICTED CLUSTERING WITH 89% ACCURACY. MEDICATION USAGE AMONG CLUSTERS DID VARY SIGNIFICANTLY. CONCLUSION: A SIMPLIFIED ALGORITHM BASED UPON HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING IS ABLE TO CLASSIFY CRS PATIENTS AND PREDICT MEDICATION USAGE. FURTHER STUDIES ARE WARRANTED TO DETERMINE IF SUCH CLUSTERING PREDICTS TREATMENT OUTCOMES.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.; DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCES, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.; DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCES, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, OREGON HEALTH SCIENCES UNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OR.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, OREGON HEALTH SCIENCES UNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OR.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY, CALGARY, ALBERTA, CANADA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.;",NA,"© 2015 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,"THE AUTHORS HAVE NO OTHER FUNDING, FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS, OR CONFLICTS OF INTEREST TO DISCLOSE.","2015/02/20 06:00","20160211","20150217",2015,"2015/02/20 06:00","INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2017 JAN;7(1):106.

AN EMPHASIS HAS BEEN PLACED ON DISEASESPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL AS THE PREDOMINANT MEASURE FOR MOST CURRENT OUTCOME STUDIES. THEREFORE A VALIDATED MEASURE OF HEALTH-RELATED QOL IN SINONASAL DISEASE IS NEEDED. THE PRESENT PROSPECTIVE AND OBSERVATIONAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON 50 PATIENTS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF ENT AT GOVT. MEDICAL COLLEGE AND RAJINDRA HOSPITAL PATIALA, PUNJAB, INDIA. THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE THE FOLLOWING: (1) THE CHANCE OF ATTAINING MINIMAL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE (MCID) IMPROVEMENTS OF NINE POINTS AT THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AFTER ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS) FOR DIFFERENT PREOPERATIVE QOL LEVELS, AND (2) THE PERCENTAGE OF RELATIVE IMPROVEMENT IN SNOT-22 AFTER ESS FOR DIFFERENT PREOPERATIVE QOL LEVELS. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH CRS WHO WERE ELECTED FOR ESS WERE PROSPECTIVELY ENROLLED INTO AN OBSERVATIONAL COHORT STUDY. THEY WERE CATEGORIZED INTO 10 PREOPERATIVE SNOT-22 GROUPS BASED ON 10-POINT INCREMENTS BEGINNING WITH A SCORE OF 10 AND ENDING AT 110. STANDARD PROTOCOL FOR ALL PATIENTS PRESENTING FOR EVALUATION INCLUDED COMPLETION OF THE SNOT-22 PRIOR TO AND FOLLOWING SURGICAL INTERVENTION. THE SCORES WERE CALCULATED AND THE DATA COLLECTED WERE COMPILED AND ANALYZED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 50 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY. PATIENTS WITH A SNOT-22 SCORE BETWEEN 10 AND 19 HAD THE LOWEST CHANCE OF ACHIEVING AN MCID. PATIENTS WITH A SNOT-22 SCORE GREATER THAN 30 HAD A GREATER THAN 90% CHANCE OF ACHIEVING AN MCID, AND THERE WAS A RELATIVE IMPROVEMENT OF 43.3% ON THEIR PREOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORES. CRS PATIENTS WITH POLYP HAD BETTER OUTCOMES (47.1% IMPROVEMENT) AFTER ESS THAN THOSE WITHOUT POLYP (33.2% IMPROVEMENT). CONCLUSION: THERE IS AN INCREASED PROBABILITY OF ACHIEVING AN MCID AT SNOT-22 SCORE >30 AND IN GENERAL THE PERCENTAGE OF RELATIVE IMPROVEMENT INCREASED WITH AN INCREASE IN PREOPERATIVE SNOT SCORE.","DEPARTMENT OF ENT AND HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, GOVERNMENT MEDICAL COLLEGE AND RAJINDRA HOSPITAL, PATIALA, PUNJAB, INDIA.; DEPARTMENT OF ENT AND HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, GOVERNMENT MEDICAL COLLEGE AND RAJINDRA HOSPITAL, PATIALA, PUNJAB, INDIA.; DEPARTMENT OF ENT AND HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, GOVERNMENT MEDICAL COLLEGE AND RAJINDRA HOSPITAL, PATIALA, PUNJAB, INDIA.; DEPARTMENT OF ENT AND HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, GOVERNMENT MEDICAL COLLEGE AND RAJINDRA HOSPITAL, PATIALA, PUNJAB, INDIA.; DEPARTMENT OF ENT AND HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, GOVERNMENT MEDICAL COLLEGE AND RAJINDRA HOSPITAL, PATIALA, PUNJAB, INDIA.; DEPARTMENT OF ENT AND HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, GOVERNMENT MEDICAL COLLEGE AND RAJINDRA HOSPITAL, PATIALA, PUNJAB, INDIA.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,"THERE ARE NO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST","2018/08/30 06:00","20181031",NA,2018,"2018/08/30 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"9",NA,"1119-3077 (PRINT)","101150032","NIGERIAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE","ENG","10.4103/NJCP.NJCP_429_17 [DOI]","20181031","2018/11/01 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","1228-1233","INDIA",NA,NA,"30156212","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"NIGER J CLIN PRACT. 2018 SEP;21(9):1228-1233.

METHODOLOGY: ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-SEVEN PATIENTS UNDERGOING MEDICAL MANAGEMENT FOR CRS WERE RECRUITED. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSESSED AT TWO TIME POINTS: ENROLLMENT AND A FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT THREE TO NINE MONTHS LATER. AT EACH TIME POINT, CRS RELATED ANTIBIOTIC AND ORAL CORTICOSTEROID USAGE IN THE PREVIOUS THREE MONTHS WAS MEASURED, WHILE GENERAL AND DISEASE-SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) WAS MEASURED USING THE VISUAL ANALOG SCALE OF THE 5-DIMENSION EUROQOL QUESTIONNAIRE (EQ-5D VAS) AND THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS: THE FREQUENCY OF CRS-RELATED ANTIBIOTICS AND ORAL CORTICOSTEROIDS USE WAS CROSS-SECTIONALLY CORRELATED WITH EQ-5D VAS AND SNOT-22 AT THE CORRESPONDING TIME POINTS. FOR PARTICIPANTS REPORTING USAGE OF THESE MEDICATIONS AT ENROLLMENT, THERE WAS A DECREASE OF 1 COURSE PER 3 MONTHS FOR BOTH CRS-RELATED ANTIBIOTICS AND ORAL CORTICOSTEROIDS. CHANGE IN CRS-RELATED ANTIBIOTICS FROM ENROLLMENT TO FOLLOW-UP WAS CORRELATED WITH CHANGE IN BOTH EQ-5D AND SNOT-22 OVER THE SAME TIMEFRAME. THE CHANGE IN CRSRELATED ORAL CORTICOSTEROIDS WAS CORRELATED WITH CHANGE IN BOTH EQ-5D VAS AND SNOT-22).

THIS INVESTIGATION EXPLORED QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AND SINONASAL ATTRIBUTES IN PATIENTS DURING ACUTE EPISODES (AES) AND IN-BETWEEN AES OF RARS. STUDY DESIGN: RETROSPECTIVE OUTCOMES RESEARCH. METHODS: DATA FROM PATIENTS WITH RARS WERE COLLECTED FROM TWO ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS BETWEEN 2009 AND 2017 USING PROSPECTIVE AND RETROSPECTIVE METHODOLOGY. DURING CLINICAL PRESENTATION, SUBJECTS WERE CLASSIFIED AS WITH OR WITHOUT AN AES USING GUIDELINE DEFINITIONS OF ACUTE BACTERIAL RHINOSINUSITIS (ABRS). BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES IN 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SURVEY AND LUND-KENNEDY (LK) ENDOSCOPY SCORES WERE ASSESSED. RESULTS: FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY-THREE CLINICAL VISITS FROM 202 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED. VISITS DURING AN AE (168/423, 40%) WERE ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE SNOT-22 TOTAL SCORES COMPARED TO BETWEEN AES (255/423, 60%; MEDIAN = 53.0 [INTERQUARTILE RANGE (IQR) = 24.0] VS. 34.0 [IQR = 29.5]) AND ALL SNOT-22 SUBDOMAIN SCORES (ALL P < .001). LK SCORES WERE AVAILABLE FOR 167 VISITS, WITH 56 (34%) COMPLETED DURING AN AE. COMPARED TO VISITS WITHOUT AN AE, ENDOSCOPY FINDINGS ASSOCIATED WITH AN AE WERE LESS FREQUENTLY NORMAL (LK SCORE = 0, 45% VS. 62%, P = .031) WITH WORSE MEDIAN LK SCORES (2.0 [IQR = 4.0] VS. 0.0 [IQR = 2.0], P = .005). CONCLUSIONS: AES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE QOL AND MILDLY WORSE ENDOSCOPIC FINDINGS. ALMOST HALF OF VISITS DURING AES HAD NEGATIVE ENDOSCOPY, IDENTIFYING A DISPARITY BETWEEN PATIENT SYMPTOMS AND OBJECTIVE FINDINGS AND CALLING INTO QUESTION ALTERNATIVE OR CONCOMITANT DIAGNOSES.

THE STUDY ENROLLED PATIENTS (N = 100) WHO UNDERWENT ENDOSCOPY FOR GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE. PATIENTS WITH LARYNGOPHARYNGEAL REFLUX (LPR) WERE IDENTIFIED BY REFLUX SYMPTOM INDEX (RSI) AND REFLUX FINDING SCORE (RFS). PATIENTS WERE DIVIDED INTO 2 GROUPS: LPR (+) (N = 64) H PYLORI (+), RSI > 13, RFS > 7; LPR (-) (N = 36) H PYLORI (+), RSI < 13, RFS < 7. VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS), SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22), PEAK NASAL INSPIRATORY FLOWMETER (PNIF), MUCOCILIARY CLEARANCE (MCC), AND OLFACTORY TESTS WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE NASAL FUNCTIONS. THE AVERAGE VAS FOR NASAL OBSTRUCTION, PNIF, AND MCC DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN THE LPR (+) AND LPR (-) GROUPS (P > .05). HOWEVER, THE AVERAGE OLFACTORY TEST SCORES WERE LOWER IN THE LPR (+) PATIENTS THAN THE LPR (-) PATIENTS (P < .05). ALSO, THE SNOT-22 SCORES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN LPR (+) PATIENTS THAN IN LPR (-) (P < .01). NASAL FUNCTIONS AND SYMPTOM SCORES WERE ALSO EVALUATED ACCORDING TO THE H PYLORI GRADING.

RECURRENCE RATES LARGELY VARY IN LITERATURE AND ASTHMA SEEMS TO BE A COMORBID FACTOR. OBJECTIVE: IN THIS STUDY, WE AIM TO ESTIMATE DISEASE RECURRENCE DURING A LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP, TOGETHER WITH THE INVESTIGATION OF POSSIBLE PREDICTING AND/OR INFLUENCING PARAMETERS. METHODS: OUT OF 196 PATIENTS OPERATED FOR CRSWNP BETWEEN 01/2000 AND 01/2006, 133 PATIENTS HAD A FOLLOW-UP OF AT LEAST 10 YEARS AND COULD BE INCLUDED. THE INFLAMMATORY PROFILE AT SURGERY WAS DETERMINED ON NASAL TISSUE AND SINONASAL SECRETIONS, AND INCLUDED ANALYSIS OF EOSINOPHILS, EOSINOPHILIC-RICH MUCUS (ERM) TYPICALLY CONTAINING CHARCOT-LEYDEN CRYSTALS (CLC), AND FUNGAL HYPHAE (FH). DURING FOLLOW-UP, RECURRENCE, RECEIVED TREATMENTS AND COMORBIDITIES WERE COLLECTED. RESULTS: OUT OF THE 133 INCLUDED PATIENTS, LOCAL EOSINOPHILIA WAS PRESENT IN 81% AND ERM IN 60%. RECURRENCE DURING FOLLOW-UP WAS OBSERVED IN 62%, AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LOCAL EOSINOPHILIA AND ERM (BOTH P < 0.001). ASTHMA WAS PRESENT IN 28% AT INCLUSION, AND 17% DEVELOPED ASTHMA AFTER SURGERY DURING FOLLOW-UP. THE PRESENCE OF ASTHMA, AT INCLUSION AS WELL AS DEVELOPED DURING FOLLOW-UP, WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH RECURRENCE OF CRSWNP (P = 0.001 FOR GROUP COMPARISON). CONCLUSION: RECURRENCE AFTER CRSWNP SURGERY IS COMMON WHEN A LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. ERM DETECTED IN SINONASAL SECRETIONS AT SURGERY SEEMS TO BE A PREDICTIVE FACTOR FOR RECURRENCE AND NEED FOR REVISION SURGERY. ASTHMA IS A FREQUENTLY FOUND COMORBID FACTOR IN CRSWNP, DEVELOPS EVEN AT HIGHER AGE DESPITE SURGICAL TREATMENT FOR CRSWNP, AND IS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH A HIGHER RECURRENCE RATE.

HOWEVER, SUCCESSFULLY LIMITING NARCOTIC OVERPRESCRIPTION REQUIRES PERIOPERATIVE IDENTIFICATION OF PATIENTS WHO ARE AT RISK FOR HIGH POSTOPERATIVE PAIN. UNFORTUNATELY, QUALITY DATA TO GUIDE PRACTICE PATTERNS ARE LACKING. WE THEREFORE PROSPECTIVELY INVESTIGATED SEVERAL POSSIBLE PREDICTIVE FACTORS OF POSTOPERATIVE PAIN AFTER ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS). METHODS: SIXTY-FOUR CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS UNDERGOING ESS WERE ENROLLED. BASELINE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOMES TEST (SNOT-22) AND SHORT-FORM 8 (SF-8) SCORES WERE OBTAINED. PAIN SCORES WERE COLLECTED POSTOPERATIVELY USING A NUMERIC RATING SCALE. SPEARMAN CORRELATIONS AND UNIVARIATE LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS WERE USED TO INVESTIGATE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN POSTOPERATIVE PAIN, PATIENT FACTORS, AND SNOT-22/SF-8 DOMAIN SCORES. MULTIVARIATE LINEAR REGRESSION WAS THEN PERFORMED TO CONTROL FOR POTENTIAL CONFOUNDING VARIABLES. RESULTS: DAY-OF-SURGERY PAIN SCORES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH THE SF-8 ROLE-PHYSICAL DOMAIN (RS = 0.32, P = 0.04). WHEREAS SF-8 PAIN SCORES WERE INITIALLY NONSIGNIFICANT, AT POSTOPERATIVE DAY 3 (POD3) THE PREOPERATIVE SF-8 PAIN SCORE BECAME CORRELATED WITH SELF-REPORTED PAIN (RS = 0.39, P = 0.02). SNOT-22 TOTAL AND SUBDOMAIN SCORES WERE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH PAIN SCORES AT ANY TIME POINT. MULTIVARIATE LINEAR REGRESSION MODELLING IDENTIFIED BASELINE SF-8 ROLE-PHYSICAL AND PAIN SCORES, SMOKING STATUS, AND UNDERGOING A MODIFIED LOTHROP PROCEDURE AS SIGNIFICANT INDEPENDENT PREDICTORS OF POD3 PAIN (ADJUSTED R(2) = 0.359, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: BASELINE PATIENT-REPORTED GLOBAL QUALITY-OF-LIFE MEASURES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH POSTOPERATIVE PAIN AFTER ESS.

EIGHTEEN TO 30% OF PREGNANT PATIENTS REPORT SYMPTOMS OF RHINITIS. PREGNANCY RHINITIS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AND MAY CAUSE OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA (OSA), WHICH IN TURN MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF PREGNANCY. PREVIOUS EXAMINATIONS OF THE PREVALENCE OF PREGNANCY RHINITIS DURING DIFFERENT STAGES OF PREGNANCY HAVE BEEN INCONCLUSIVE. THIS STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE RHINOSINUSITIS-SPECIFIC QOL DURING DIFFERENT STAGES OF PREGNANCY. METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL OBSERVATION STUDY OF PATIENTS IN THE SECOND AND THIRD TRIMESTERS OF PREGNANCY USING THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) WAS CONDUCTED IN THE OBSTETRIC CLINIC AT MCGILL UNIVERSITY HEALTH CENTER IN MONTREAL, CANADA. SEVENTY-SIX LOW- RISK PREGNANT PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. THIRTY-TWO PATIENTS WERE IN THE SECOND TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY AND 44 PATIENTS WERE IN THE THIRD TRIMESTER. RESULTS: AVERAGE ITEM SCORES FOR THE ENTIRE QUESTIONNAIRE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER (P = 0.041), INDICATING MORE SEVERE IMPAIRMENT OF QOL, IN THE THIRD TRIMESTER IN COMPARISON WITH THE SECOND TRIMESTER. A COMPARISON BETWEEN WOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT PREEXISTING ALLERGIC RHINITIS, IN BOTH THE SECOND AND THE THIRD TRIMESTERS, SHOWS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SNOT-22 SCORES FOR THE ALLERGIC GROUP (P = 0.007). QOL WAS LOWER IN THE THIRD TRIMESTER THAN IN NONRHINOSINUSITIS PATIENTS (P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: RHINOSINUSITIS-SPECIFIC QOL IS LOWER IN THE THIRD TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY IN COMPARISON WITH THE SECOND TRIMESTER AND ALSO IN COMPARISON WITH NONRHINOSINUSITIS PATIENTS. INCREASED AWARENESS MAY ENHANCE THE QOL OF PREGNANT PATIENTS, PREVENT OSA, AND THEREBY POSITIVELY INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF PREGNANCY.","OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY UNIT, ZIV MEDICAL CENTER, ZEFAT, ISRAEL.; PETER.;G@ZIV.;HEALTH.;GOV.;IL",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2012/07/18 06:00","20121210",NA,2012,"2012/07/18 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"4",NA,"1945-8932 (ELECTRONIC) 1945-8932 (LINKING)","101490775","AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RHINOLOGY & ALLERGY","ENG","10.2500/AJRA.2012.26.3776 [DOI]","20120717","2012/12/12 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","283-6","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"22801015","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"AM J RHINOL ALLERGY. 2012 JUL-AUG;26(4):283-6.

USUAL THERAPIES ARE INADEQUATE FOR ASTHMA AND/OR NASAL POLYPOSIS, LEADING TO DECREASED QUALITY OF LIFE. OBJECTIVE: OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF DUPILUMAB IN AERD PATIENTS WITH UNCONTROLLED, CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITH NASAL POLYPOSIS (CRSWNP). METHODS: PATIENTS 18 YEARS AND OLDER WITH A PHYSICIAN DIAGNOSIS OF AERD AND SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST 22 (SNOT 22) SCORE =19 DESPITE STANDARD MEDICAL THERAPY WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDY. PATIENTS RECEIVED ONE MONTH OF PLACEBO DOSING, FOLLOWED BY 6 MONTHS OF DUPILUMAB. PATIENTS WERE BLINDED TO THE ORDER OF THERAPY. WILCOXON-PAIRED RANK SUM TEST WAS USED TO COMPARE STUDY OUTCOMES AT BASELINE AND THE COMPLETION OF THE STUDY. RESULTS: TEN PATIENTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. THE MEDIAN BASELINE SNOT 22 SCORE IMPROVED FROM 46 [IQR: 34 TO 64.8] TO 9.5 [IQR: 2.5 TO 19] AFTER 6 MONTHS OF THERAPY (P = 0.0050). THE MEDIAN BASELINE LUND MACKAY SCORE IMPROVED FROM 21.5 [IQR: 17 TO 23.3] TO 4 [IQR: 1.2 TO 6] AFTER 6 MONTHS OF THERAPY (P = 0.0050). THERE WAS ALSO IMPROVEMENT IN THE FOLLOWING SECONDARY OUTCOMES: ASTHMA CONTROL TEST (ACT), MINI ASTHMA QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE (AQLQ), AND UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA SMELL IDENTIFICATION TEST (UPSIT). EXHALED NITRIC OXIDE (FENO), TOTAL SERUM IGE, 24-HOUR URINARY LEUKOTRIENE E(4), AND SERUM THYMUS AND ACTIVATION REGULATED CYTOKINE (TARC) ALSO DECREASED. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT STUDY-RELATED ADVERSE EVENTS. CONCLUSION: DUPILUMAB WAS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AS ADD-ON THERAPY FOR CRSWNP IN AERD, IMPROVING PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES, SINUS OPACIFICATION, AND MARKERS OF T2 INFLAMMATION.","DIVISION OF ALLERGY, IMMUNOLOGY, RHEUMATOLOGY, ROCHESTER REGIONAL HEALTH, ROCHESTER, NEW YORK.; DIVISION OF ALLERGY, IMMUNOLOGY, RHEUMATOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER, ROCHESTER, NEW YORK.; DIVISION OF CRITICAL CARE, MERCY HOSPITAL, SPRINGFIELD, MISSOURI.; DIVISION OF ALLERGY, IMMUNOLOGY, RHEUMATOLOGY, ROCHESTER REGIONAL HEALTH, ROCHESTER, NEW YORK.; DIVISION OF ALLERGY, IMMUNOLOGY, RHEUMATOLOGY, ROCHESTER REGIONAL HEALTH, ROCHESTER, NEW YORK.; DIVISION OF ALLERGY, IMMUNOLOGY, RHEUMATOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER, ROCHESTER, NEW YORK.;","ORCID: 0000-0001-9691-7590",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020/09/24 05:23","20210818","20200923",2021,"2020/09/25 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,"1945-8932 (ELECTRONIC) 1945-8932 (LINKING)","101490775","AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RHINOLOGY & ALLERGY","ENG","10.1177/1945892420961969 [DOI]","20210913","2021/08/19 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","399-407","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"32967430","PPUBLISH","0 (ANTIBODIES, MONOCLONAL, HUMANIZED) 420K487FSG (DUPILUMAB) R16CO5Y76E (ASPIRIN)","IM",NA,"AM J RHINOL ALLERGY. 2021 MAY;35(3):399-407.

THIS STUDY SEEKS TO IDENTIFY COFACTORS INFLUENCING PATIENTS WITH CRS AND LOW 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES TO SEEK CARE. STUDY DESIGN: PROSPECTIVE, MULTICENTER, OBSERVATIONAL COHORT. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH CRS WERE ENROLLED BETWEEN APRIL 2011 AND SEPTEMBER 2015. PATIENTS WITH SINONASAL MUCOCELE OR UNILATERAL SINUS OPACIFICATION WERE EXCLUDED. CONTROL SUBJECTS WITHOUT CRS WERE ENROLLED FOR COMPARISON. LOW-SNOT CRS WAS DEFINED AS A SNOT-22 SCORE < 20. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 774 SUBJECTS (LOW-SNOT CRS, N = 38; HIGH-SNOT CRS, SNOT-22 = 20, N = 641; CONTROLS WITHOUT CRS, N = 95) WERE ENROLLED. LOW SNOT SCORES WERE IDENTIFIED IN 6% OF SUBJECTS WITH CRS.

VEE PATIENTS HAD THEIR EXAMINATION PERFORMED WITH A VIDEO CAMERA ATTACHED TO THE SCOPE, RECORDED, AND THEN USED FOR THE EXPLANATION. ALL PATIENTS WERE ASKED TO COMPLETE THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AND THE 18-ITEM PATIENT SATISFACTION QUESTIONNAIRE SHORT-FORM (PSQ-18). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COHORTS. RESULTS: THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DEMOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS. SNOT-22 TOTAL AND DOMAIN SCORES WERE SIMILAR BETWEEN BOTH GROUPS (P > 0.05). VEE PATIENTS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER GENERAL SATISFACTION (P = 0.048) AND COMMUNICATION (P = 0.028) DOMAINS WITHIN THE PSQ-18. THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OTHER DOMAINS (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: VEE IS A VALUABLE TOOL FOR OTOLARYNGOLOGISTS AND PATIENTS. FURTHER STUDIES EVALUATING VARIANCE IN PATIENT COMPLIANCE AND SYMPTOMATOLOGY MAY PROVIDE FURTHER JUSTIFICATION FOR ITS USE.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER, KANSAS CITY, KS.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER, KANSAS CITY, KS.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER, KANSAS CITY, KS.; UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, KANSAS CITY, KS.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER, KANSAS CITY, KS.;",NA,"© 2018 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2018/02/20 06:00","20190513","20180219",2018,"2018/02/20 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"6",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.22100 [DOI]","20190513","2019/05/14 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","737-740","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"29457873","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2018 JUN;8(6):737-740.

EVEN THOUGH IT DOES NOT PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF THESE PATIENTS, IT INCREASES THE MORBIDITY RATE OF CF, WITH DETERIORATION OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND OF GENERAL HEALTH STATUS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS THE EVALUATION OF THE IMPACT OF SINONASAL DISEASE AND EXTENSIVE ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (EESS) ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OF CF PATIENTS BY MEANS OF THE 22 ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AND DEFINE IF THERE IS A CORRELATION BETWEEN SNOT-22 AND THE LUND-MACKAY SCORE.

IN THIS STUDY WE ANALYZE ACUTELY PERFORMED COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) IN A POPULATION WITH SUSPECTED OR SELF-DIAGNOSED \"SINUS\" DISEASE. METHODS: PATIENTS REFERRED TO A TERTIARY CLINIC FOR SUSPECTED RECARS WERE ASSESSED. SINUS CHANGES WERE DEFINED BY CT (INITIAL ASSESSMENT) AND DURING THE ACUTE EVENT, BY A SEMIURGENT CT PERFORMED DURING THE SYMPTOMATIC EPISODE. MUCOSAL THICKENING, OSTIOMEATAL COMPROMISE, AND SEVERE SEPTAL DEFORMITY WERE RECORDED. SYMPTOM PROFILE WAS ASSESSED DURING BOTH TIME-POINTS WITH THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22).

HOWEVER, THE SHORT-TERM CLINICAL AND QUALITY-OF-LIFE MORBIDITY AFTER DRAF-III RELATIVE TO LESS-EXTENSIVE PROCEDURES HAS YET TO BE INVESTIGATED. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE SURGICAL AND QUALITY-OF-LIFE OUTCOMES, INCLUDING THE BURDEN OF FOLLOW-UP CARE, IN PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT ENDOSCOPIC MODIFIED LOTHROP (DRAF-III), AND COMPARED THESE RESULTS WITH A LESS-EXTENSIVE INTERVENTION, THE ENDOSCOPIC FRONTAL SINUSOTOMY (DRAF-IIA). METHODS: A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF EARLY (<8 WEEKS) POSTOPERATIVE RECOVERY OF PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT DRAF-III (2014 TO 2016) FOR CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WAS CONDUCTED AND COMPARED WITH AGE AND RADIOGRAPHICALLY MATCHED DRAF-IIA CONTROLS. PRIMARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED PERIOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS, THE NUMBER OF POSTOPERATIVE CLINIC VISITS, DEBRIDEMENTS, AND STEROID AND ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY DAYS. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED THE CHANGE IN THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES AND/OR SUBSCORES (DOMAINS). RESULTS: THIRTY-EIGHT PATIENTS (19 DRAF-III, 19 DRAF-IIA) WERE INCLUDED. PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT DRAF-III VERSUS DRAF-IIA REQUIRED MORE POSTOPERATIVE CLINIC VISITS (4.9 ± 1.7 VERSUS 3.3 ± 0.8; P < 0.05), DEBRIDEMENTS (4.2 ± 2.0 VERSUS 2.3 ± 0.8; P < 0.05), AND ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY DAYS (24.4 ± 11.8 VERSUS 15.6 ± 6.3; P < 0.05). THE MEAN (SD) SNOT-22 SCORES IMPROVED FOR BOTH GROUPS (-12.7 ± 34.5 VERSUS -9.5 ± 20.4; P = 0.74) OVER THE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD, AND SUBSCORE (DOMAIN) ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATED WORSENING EXTRANASAL SYMPTOMS (2.5 ± 3.0 VERSUS -1.5 ± 4.7; P < 0.05) AT THE FIRST POSTOPERATIVE VISIT, AND LESS IMPROVEMENT IN EAR/FACIAL SYMPTOMS AT THE SECOND (-0.5 ± 2.6 VERSUS -3.9 ± 4.7; P = 0.03) AND THIRD POSTOPERATIVE VISITS (-1.1 ± 1.6 VERSUS 3.5 ± 3.3; P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: DRAF-III IS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE POSTOPERATIVE CLINIC VISITS, DEBRIDEMENTS, AND ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY DAYS.

WE SOUGHT TO VALIDATE THIS FINDING BY DETERMINING WHETHER IMPROVEMENT IN NASAL OBSTRUCTION WOULD TRANSLATE TO IMPROVEMENT IN DEPRESSED MOOD. METHODS: THIS WAS A PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL STUDY OF 150 PATIENTS UNDERGOING MEDICAL MANAGEMENT FOR CRS. DATA WERE COLLECTED AT TWO TIMEPOINTS: ENROLLMENT AND A SUBSEQUENT FOLLOW-UP VISIT 3-12 MONTHS LATER. IMPACT OF NASAL OBSTRUCTION WAS MEASURED USING THE NASAL OBSTRUCTION SYMPTOM EVALUATION (NOSE) INSTRUMENT AND DEPRESSED MOOD WAS MEASURED USING THE 2-ITEM PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE (PHQ-2). SINONASAL SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH CRS WERE ALSO MEASURED USING THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). CLINICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS WERE COLLECTED. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHANGES IN PHQ-2 AND NOSE SCORES WAS DETERMINED WITH CORRELATION AND LINEAR REGRESSION. RESULTS: CHANGE IN PHQ-2 SCORE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH CHANGE IN NOSE SCORE (<U+03A1> = 0.30, P < 0.001). AFTER CONTROLLING FOR COVARIATES, CHANGE IN PHQ-2 SCORE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGE IN NOSE SCORE (ADJUSTED LINEAR REGRESSION COEFFICIENT [<U+0392>] = 0.014, 95% CI 0.006-0.022, P = 0.001). WE CONFIRMED THESE RELATIONSHIPS, FINDING THAT CHANGE IN PHQ-2 WAS ASSOCIATED (ADJUSTED <U+0392>  = 0.037, 95% CI 0.013-0.061, P = 0.003) WITH CHANGE IN THE NASAL SUBDOMAIN SCORE OF THE SNOT-22. IMPROVEMENT IN NOSE SCORE BY GREATER THAN 22 POINTS WAS PREDICTIVE OF IMPROVEMENT IN PHQ-2 SCORE WITH SENSITIVITY 54.5% AND 83.8% SPECIFICITY (P < 0.001).

FURTHERMORE, THIS BURDEN HAS NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY INVESTIGATED IN THE CONTEXT OF A PUBLICLY FUNDED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO CHARACTERIZE THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF CRS ON PATIENTS, SPECIFICALLY BY EVALUATING ITS ASSOCIATED OOPES AND THE PERCEIVED FINANCIAL BURDEN. THE SECONDARY AIM WAS TO DETERMINE THE FACTORS PREDICTIVE OF OOPES AND PERCEIVED BURDEN. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH CRS AT A TERTIARY CARE SINUS CENTER COMPLETED A SELF-ADMINISTERED QUESTIONNAIRE THAT ASSESSED THEIR SOCIOECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS, DISEASE-SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE (22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST [SNOT-22]), WORKDAYS MISSED DUE TO CRS, PERCEIVED FINANCIAL BURDEN, AND DIRECT MEDICAL AND NONMEDICAL OOPES OVER A 12-MONTH PERIOD. TOTAL OOPES WERE CALCULATED FROM THE SUM OF DIRECT MEDICAL AND NONMEDICAL OOPES. REGRESSION ANALYSES DETERMINED FACTORS PREDICTIVE OF OOPES AND THE PERCEIVED BURDEN. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 84 PATIENTS COMPLETED THE QUESTIONNAIRES. AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE AND THE MEDIAN DIRECT MEDICAL, DIRECT NONMEDICAL, AND TOTAL OOPES PER PATIENT OVER A 12-MONTH PERIOD WERE CANADIAN DOLLARS (CAD) $336.00 (2011) [U.S. $339.85], CAD $129.87 [U.S. $131.86], AND CAD $607.10 [U.S. $614.06], RESPECTIVELY.

FACTORS PREDICTIVE OF A HIGHER FINANCIAL BURDEN INCLUDED YOUNGER AGE, A GREATER NUMBER OF PREVIOUS SINUS SURGERIES, <80% HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE, RESIDING OUT OF TOWN, AND HIGHER SNOT-22 SCORES. CONCLUSION: TOTAL OOPES INCURRED FROM THE TREATMENT OF CRS MAY AMOUNT TO CAD $607.10 [U.S. $614.06] PER PATIENT PER YEAR, WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A SINGLE-PAYER HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.

ROC ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED EQUALLY OPTIMAL SNOT-22 SCORES OF GREATER THAN 32 (SENSITIVITY: 88.1%, SPECIFICITY: 41.2%) OR GREATER THAN 65 (SENSITIVITY: 38.1%, SPECIFICITY: 91.2%) FOR DETECTING THE NEED FOR AT LEAST ONE COURSE OF ORAL CORTICOSTEROIDS WITHIN THE PAST YEAR. CONCLUSIONS: CRS SYMPTOM SEVERITY IS ASSOCIATED WITH PAST ASTHMA-RELATED ORAL CORTICOSTEROID USE. SNOT-22 SCORES MAY BE USED AS A VERSATILE TOOL TO SCREEN FOR PAST ASTHMA-RELATED ORAL CORTICOSTEROID USE IN ASTHMATIC CRS PATIENTS - I.E. THOSE AT GREATEST RISK FROM THEIR ASTHMA - WITH EITHER HIGH SENSITIVITY OR HIGH SPECIFICITY.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MA, USA.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017/06/26 06:00","20171016",NA,2017,"2017/06/26 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,"0300-0729 (PRINT) 0300-0729 (LINKING)","0347242","RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.4193/RHIN17.029 [DOI]","20171016","2017/10/17 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","211-217","NETHERLANDS",NA,NA,"28647751","PPUBLISH","0 (ANTI-ASTHMATIC AGENTS)","IM",NA,"RHINOLOGY. 2017 SEP 1;55(3):211-217.

IN 2012, THE OUTSIDE-IN APPROACH TO THE DRAF III WAS DESCRIBED AS A SAFE AND EFFICIENT PROCEDURE. SMELL RECOVERY IN INFLAMMATORY CRS IS CHALLENGING, AND TO DATE THERE IS LIMITED EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT DRAF III IMPROVES PATIENT-REPORTED OLFACTORY DYSFUNCTION FROM CRS. METHODS: A CONSECUTIVE SERIES OF PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT AN OUTSIDE-IN DRAF III FOR INFLAMMATORY CRS BY A SINGLE, TERTIARY RHINOLOGIST WERE REVIEWED. PATIENTS WERE EXCLUDED IF THE DRAF III WAS PERFORMED FOR NONINFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS. POSTOPERATIVELY, PATIENTS WERE MAINTAINED ON LONG-TERM CORTICOSTEROID IRRIGATIONS, AND ADHERENCE WAS ASSESSED. PROSPECTIVELY COLLECTED DATA INCLUDED PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS, A VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE FOR SMELL, OVERALL SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST SCORE (SNOT-22), GLOBAL NASAL FUNCTION SCORE, AND A CLINICIAN-GRADED CLINICAL OUTCOME SCORE. RESULTS: ONE HUNDRED AND FOUR PATIENTS (41.1% FEMALE) AGED 54 ± 12 YEARS UNDERWENT AN OUTSIDE-IN DRAF III. THE MEDIAN FOLLOW-UP TIME WAS 30.6 MONTHS (RANGE 12.2-72.1). THE MAJORITY OF PATIENTS RATED THEIR SMELL LOSS AS MODERATE OR WORSE PREOPERATIVELY; HOWEVER, THIS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED AT POSTOPERATIVE REVIEW (71.2% VS. 27.6%; KENDALL TAU-B, P < 0.01). THE SNOT-22 SCORE IMPROVED AFTER SURGERY (2.32 ± 1.09 VS. 0.78 ± 0.69, P < 0.0001). MEDICATION ADHERENCE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED CLINICAL OUTCOME SCORE (KENDALL TAU-B, P < 0.004). ASPIRIN EXACERBATED RESPIRATORY DISEASE WAS FOUND TO BE A SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTOR PREDICTING POOR CLINICAL OUTCOME ON UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS (ODDS RATIO = 4.69 (1.03-21.2), P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: THE OUTSIDE-IN DRAF III APPEARS TO FACILITATE SUSTAINED, MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENT IN SEVERAL SELF-REPORTED OUTCOMES, INCLUDING SMELL.

HOWEVER, SIMILAR ESTIMATIONS FOR THE MCID HAVE NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED FOR PATIENTS ELECTING CONTINUED APPROPRIATE MEDICAL THERAPY (CAMT). WE SOUGHT TO DETERMINE MCID VALUES FOR A MEDICALLY TREATED CRS COHORT AND COMPARE THEM TO HISTORICAL MCIDS ASSOCIATED WITH ESS. STUDY DESIGN: PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL COHORT STUDY. METHODS: ONE HUNDRED TWENTY PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY CRS ELECTING CAMT WERE PROSPECTIVELY ENROLLED FROM ACADEMIC REFERRAL CLINICS INTO AN OBSERVATIONAL COHORT STUDY. BASELINE AND POSTTREATMENT SNOT-22 SURVEY RESPONSES WERE COLLECTED. FOUR DISTRIBUTION-BASED METHODS FOR CALCULATING MCIDS (E.G., HALF-STANDARD DEVIATION, COHEN'S D, STANDARD ERROR OF MEASUREMENT, AND MINIMUM DETECTABLE CHANGE) WERE USED TO IDENTIFY A RANGE OF MCID VALUES FOR SNOT-22 TOTAL AND DOMAIN SCORES. RESULTS: THE AVERAGE MCID VALUE FOR SNOT-22 TOTAL SCORES WAS 8.0, WHEREAS MEAN MCID VALUES FOR RHINOLOGIC, EXTRANASAL RHINOLOGIC, EAR/FACIAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SLEEP SYMPTOM DOMAIN SCORES WERE 3.9, 2.5, 3.3, 3.4, AND 2.9, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARABLE TO PREVIOUSLY REPORTED VALUES FOR PATIENTS ELECTING ESS. ALTHOUGH CHANGE IN SNOT-22 TOTAL SCORES FOLLOWING CAMT EXCEEDED THE MCID, NONE OF THE AVERAGE SNOT-22 DOMAIN SCORE IMPROVEMENTS SURPASSED THEIR RESPECTIVE MCID THRESHOLDS. CONCLUSIONS: MCID VALUES FOR SNOT-22 TOTAL AND DOMAIN SCORES IN PATIENTS ELECTING CAMT ARE SIMILAR TO PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED MCID VALUES ASSOCIATED WITH ESS, INDICATING THAT MCID VALUES ARE INDEPENDENT OF TREATMENT MODALITY SELECTION.

OUR AIM WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF ETHMOIDECTOMY ALONE FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC FRONTAL SINUSITIS. METHODS: ADULTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS PROSPECTIVELY ENROLLED IN A MULTICENTER STUDY WHO DEMONSTRATED FRONTAL SINUSITIS ON COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY WERE DIVIDED INTO 2 GROUPS: (1) ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS) INCORPORATING ETHMOIDECTOMY, BUT EXCLUDING FRONTAL SINUSOTOMY; AND (2) ESS INCORPORATING FRONTAL SINUSOTOMY. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS IMPROVEMENT IN 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED ENDOSCOPIC SCORES AND USE OF CORTICOSTEROIDS AND ANTIBIOTICS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 196 CASES UNDERGOING FRONTAL SINUSOTOMY AND 30 CASES TREATED WITH ETHMOIDECTOMY WITHOUT FRONTAL SINUSOTOMY WERE ANALYZED AND WERE COMPARABLE DEMOGRAPHICALLY. THE PREVALENCE OF NASAL POLYPS, PREVIOUS ESS, ASTHMA, AND ASPIRIN INTOLERANCE WAS MORE COMMON IN THE FRONTAL SINUSOTOMY GROUP (P < 0.050). PREOPERATIVE ENDOSCOPY AND COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SCORES WERE HIGHER IN THE FRONTAL SINUSOTOMY GROUP (P = 0.001). POSTOPERATIVELY, BOTH GROUPS SHOWED COMPARABLE SNOT-22 SCORES WITH WORSE ENDOSCOPY SCORES IN THE FRONTAL SINUSOTOMY GROUP (P = 0.038). POSTOPERATIVE IMPROVEMENT IN SNOT-22 TOTAL AND SUBDOMAIN SCORES WAS COMPARABLE BETWEEN GROUPS. NASAL ENDOSCOPY SCORES IMPROVED TO A GREATER DEGREE IN THE FRONTAL SINUSOTOMY GROUP (P = 0.023). DURATION OF POSTOPERATIVE TOPICAL STEROID USE WAS HIGHER IN THE FRONTAL SINUSOTOMY GROUP (P = 0.007). REVISION SURGERY WAS NEEDED IN 2.6% OF FRONTAL SINUSOTOMY PATIENTS AND 0% OF PATIENTS WITHOUT FRONTAL SINUSOTOMY. CONCLUSION: THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC FRONTAL SINUSITIS THROUGH ETHMOIDECTOMY IS A POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE TO FRONTAL SINUSOTOMY ACHIEVING SIMILAR QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) IMPROVEMENTS IN PATIENTS MANIFESTING LESS SEVERE SINUS DISEASE.","DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MONTEFIORE MEDICAL CENTER, ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, BRONX, NY.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY, OREGON HEALTH AND SCIENCE UNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OR.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MEDICAL SCHOOL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SAO PAULO, SAO PAULO, BRAZIL.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY, CALGARY, ALBERTA, CANADA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, STANFORD UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, STANFORD, CA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY, OREGON HEALTH AND SCIENCE UNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OR.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, STANFORD UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, STANFORD, CA.;",NA,"© 2016 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2016/02/17 06:00","20171120","20160216",2016,"2016/02/18 06:00",NA,NA,"R01 DC005805/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/UNITED STATES","6",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (PRINT) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.21726 [DOI]","20181113","2017/11/29 06:00","NIHMS748023",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","597-604",NA,"PMC4921290",NA,"26879467","PPUBLISH","0 (ANTI-BACTERIAL AGENTS) 0 (STEROIDS)","IM","CLINICALTRIALS.GOV/NCT01332136","INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2016 JUN;6(6):597-604.

THE IMPACT OF THE MOST COMMON CYSTIC FIBROSIS TRANSMEMBRANE CONDUCTANCE REGULATOR (CFTR) MUTATION, F508DEL, ON THE SEVERITY OF SINONASAL DISEASE REMAINS INCONCLUSIVE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF CFTR GENOTYPE FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION ON SINONASAL DISEASE SEVERITY IN PATIENTS WITH CRS. METHODS: RETROSPECTIVE CHART REVIEW OF PATIENTS WITH CF WHO UNDERWENT ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY FOR CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS FROM 1998 TO 2015. PATIENTS WERE DIVIDED INTO HIGH- OR LOW-RISK GENOTYPES BASED ON STANDARDIZED CFTR GENE FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORE. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED ENDOSCOPIC SCORES, EXTENT OF SURGERY PERFORMED, PRESENCE OF POLYPOSIS, NUMBER OF REVISION SURGERIES, AND LUND-MACKAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SCORES. RESULTS: THIRTY-EIGHT PATIENTS HARBORED A HIGH-RISK CFTR GENOTYPE, AND 11 HAD A LOW-RISK GENOTYPE. ON BIVARIATE ANALYSIS, THERE WAS NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN CFTR GENOTYPE RISK STRATIFICATION AND MEASURES OF PREOPERATIVE DISEASE SEVERITY OR POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES. THERE WERE NO ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN GENOTYPE RISK STRATIFICATION AND OUTCOME VARIABLES ON MULTIVARIATE LINEAR REGRESSION, ADJUSTED FOR AGE AND GENDER. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN SEVERAL SNOT-22 SUBDOMAINS BEFORE AND AFTER ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (P < 0.05), BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF IMPROVEMENT WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT ON THE BASIS OF CFTR GENOTYPE RISK STRATIFICATION. CONCLUSION: HIGH-RISK CFTR GENOTYPES ARE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH WORSE SINONASAL DISEASE SEVERITY OR POSTOPERATIVE SYMPTOM CONTROL THAN LOW-RISK CFTR GENOTYPES AFTER ADJUSTING FOR CONFOUNDING FACTORS.

PRIOR STUDIES HAVE NOT EXAMINED THIS TOPIC PROSPECTIVELY USING VALIDATED OUTCOME METRICS ACROSS MULTIPLE INSTITUTIONS. METHODS: A MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL, PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS) WHO UNDERWENT ESS COMPLETED THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), MISSED PRODUCTIVITY, AND MEDICATION USAGE QUESTIONNAIRES 6 MONTHS POSTOPERATIVELY. LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPY SCORING (LKES) WAS PERFORMED WITH REVIEWERS BLINDED TO PATIENT-REPORTED DATA. A CONTROL COHORT OF NON-CRS PATIENTS WAS RECRUITED FOR COMPARISON. RESULTS: COMPLETE DATA WAS AVAILABLE ON 183 CRS PATIENTS AND 48 NON-CRS CONTROL PATIENTS. APPROXIMATELY 50% OF PATIENTS ACHIEVE PERFECT OR NEAR PERFECT ENDOSCOPY (LKES 0 TO 2) AFTER ESS. POSTOPERATIVE ENDOSCOPY CORRELATED WITH TOTAL SNOT-22 SCORES (R = 0.278, P < 0.001), WITH THE STRONGEST CORRELATIONS TO RHINOLOGIC AND EXTRANASAL SUBDOMAINS IN THE NASAL POLYP COHORT. IMPROVED POSTOPERATIVE ENDOSCOPY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED ANTIBIOTIC AND ORAL STEROID USAGE, BUT HAD LITTLE ASSOCIATION WITH MISSED PRODUCTIVITY. AMONG PATIENTS WHO ACHIEVED NEAR PERFECT POSTOPERATIVE ENDOSCOPY, THOSE WITH NASAL POLYPS HAD SNOT-22 SCORES THAT WERE SIMILAR TO NON-CRS CONTROL PATIENTS (MEAN SNOT-22 SCORES 17.7 AND 16.3, RESPECTIVELY). HOWEVER, CRS PATIENTS WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS REMAINED MORE SYMPTOMATIC THAN NON-CRS CONTROLS AND CRS WITH NASAL POLYPS PATIENTS DESPITE NEARLY PERFECT ENDOSCOPY (MEAN SNOT-22 SCORE 21.6). CONCLUSION: POSTOPERATIVE ENDOSCOPY CORRELATES WITH SNOT-22 AND MEDICATION USAGE IN CRS PATIENTS.

WE SOUGHT TO ANALYZE THE CORRELATIONS OF PAIN AND DISEASE-SPECIFIC QOL WITH COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN CRS. METHODS: ADULTS WITH CRS WERE PROSPECTIVELY ENROLLED IN A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY. PARTICIPANTS' COGNITIVE FUNCTION WAS ASSESSED USING THE COGNITIVE FAILURES QUESTIONNAIRE. PAIN WAS CHARACTERIZED USING THE SHORT-FORM MCGILL PAIN QUESTIONNAIRE (SF-MPQ) AND THE BRIEF PAIN INVENTORY SHORT FORM. DISEASE-SPECIFIC QOL WAS ASCERTAINED USING THE RHINOSINUSITIS DISABILITY INDEX (RSDI) AND 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). DISEASE SEVERITY WAS ASSESSED USING NASAL ENDOSCOPY AND COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY. BIVARIATE CORRELATIONS OF PAIN AND COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION, DISEASE-SPECIFIC QOL, AND CLINICAL MEASURES OF DISEASE SEVERITY WERE ASCERTAINED. RESULTS: IN PATIENTS WITH CRS (N = 70) THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION BETWEEN COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION AND PAIN SEVERITY SCORES (SPEARMAN'S CORRELATION [R(S)] = 0.321, P < 0.01). A SIMILAR CORRELATION WAS IDENTIFIED WITH PAIN INTERFERENCE (R(S) = 0.317, P < 0.01) AND COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION SCORES.

RECENTLY, THIS DISEASE HAS INCREASINGLY BEEN THE FOCUS OF INTENSIVE RESEARCH. PREVIOUS WORK HAS SHOWN THAT AR HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON SLEEP QUALITY. TO DATE THERE ARE NO PUBLISHED STUDIES DEMONSTRATING A QUANTITATIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE EXTENT OF CONTROL OF AR AND THE SEVERITY OF COMPROMISED SLEEP QUALITY. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH AR WERE PROSPECTIVELY RECRUITED INTO OUR CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY. SLEEP QUALITY WAS ASSESSED USING FIVE OF THE SLEEP SUBDOMAIN QUESTIONS FROM THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). CONTROL OF AR WAS ASSESSED USING THE RHINITIS CONTROL ASSESSMENT TEST (RCAT). ASSOCIATION WAS SOUGHT BETWEEN THE DEGREE OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS CONTROL (RCAT) AS INDEPENDENT VARIABLE AND SLEEP QUALITY AS DEPENDENT VARIABLE USING LINEAR REGRESSION. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 104 PATIENTS (54.8% FEMALE AND 45.2% MALE) WITH AN AVERAGE AGE OF 41.4 YEARS (SD: 15.9 YEARS) WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. THERE WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN THE RCAT SCORE AND THE SCORE OF EACH OF THE FIVE SNOT-22 QUESTIONS USED TO ASSESS DECREASED SLEEP QUALITY (P < 0.001).

METHODS: A POPULATION-BASED PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY AMONG 160 ADULT PATIENTS UNDERGOING PRIMARY SINONASAL SURGERY (76 SEPTOPLASTIES, SP; 84 ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERIES, ESS) WAS CONDUCTED. WE COLLECTED QOL DATA USING THE SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22) BEFORE AND AFTER SURGERY. A BENEFICIAL QOL OUTCOME WAS DEFINED AS A SNOT-22 SCORE CHANGE = 9 POINTS 12 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY. VARIOUS DEMOGRAPHIC, CLINICAL AND SYMPTOM-RELATED FACTORS PREDICTING A BENEFICIAL QOL OUTCOME WERE SOUGHT USING BINARY LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS. RESULTS: THE MEAN AGE OF THE PATIENTS WAS 39 YEARS (RANGE 18-61) AND 82 (51%) WERE MALES. THE SNOT-22 SCORE CHANGE VARIED MARKEDLY AFTER SP (RANGE - 17 TO + 80) AND ESS (RANGE - 20 TO + 58), BUT ON AVERAGE IT IMPROVED (MEDIAN + 15 AFTER SP AND + 16 AFTER ESS). 41 PATIENTS (64%) ACHIEVED BENEFICIAL QOL OUTCOME AFTER SP AND 46 (66%) AFTER ESS. IN A MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS, POOR QOL BEFORE SURGERY (PREOPERATIVE SNOT-22 = 20 POINTS) PREDICTED A BENEFICIAL QOL OUTCOME AFTER SP AND ESS (ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO 10; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL 1.6-64 AND 12; 2.5-55, RESPECTIVELY) AND A SENIOR SURGEON OPERATING AFTER SP (9.9; 1.5-67). ON RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE ANALYSIS, THE INTEGER THRESHOLD VALUE FOR THE PREOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORE THAT GAVE THE HIGHEST SENSITIVITY (74%) AND SPECIFICITY (70%) WAS 30. CONCLUSIONS: QOL CHANGE AFTER PRIMARY SP AND ESS VARIES. A PREOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORE OF AT LEAST 30 BEST PREDICTED A BENEFICIAL QOL OUTCOME AFTER BOTH PROCEDURES.","DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY AND HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, OULU UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, OYS, P.;O.; BOX 21, 90029, OULU, FINLAND.; ANTTI.;ALAKARPPA@PPSHP.;FI.; PEDEGO RESEARCH UNIT, UNIVERSITY OF OULU, OULU, FINLAND.; ANTTI.;ALAKARPPA@PPSHP.;FI.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY AND HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, OULU UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, OYS, P.;O.; BOX 21, 90029, OULU, FINLAND.; PEDEGO RESEARCH UNIT, UNIVERSITY OF OULU, OULU, FINLAND.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY AND HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, OULU UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, OYS, P.;O.; BOX 21, 90029, OULU, FINLAND.; PEDEGO RESEARCH UNIT, UNIVERSITY OF OULU, OULU, FINLAND.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY AND HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, OULU UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, OYS, P.;O.; BOX 21, 90029, OULU, FINLAND.; PEDEGO RESEARCH UNIT, UNIVERSITY OF OULU, OULU, FINLAND.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018/03/02 06:00","20180824","20180228",2018,"2018/03/02 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"5",NA,"1434-4726 (ELECTRONIC) 0937-4477 (LINKING)","9002937","EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY : OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN FEDERATION OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGICAL SOCIETIES (EUFOS) : AFFILIATED WITH THE GERMAN SOCIETY FOR OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY","ENG","10.1007/S00405-018-4918-3 [DOI]","20181202","2018/08/25 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","1139-1147","GERMANY",NA,NA,"29492664","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"EUR ARCH OTORHINOLARYNGOL. 2018 MAY;275(5):1139-1147.

STUDY DESIGN: CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 157 PATIENTS WITH CRS WERE PROSPECTIVELY RECRUITED. CRS-SPECIFIC QOL WAS MEASURED USING THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL WAS MEASURED USING THE EUROQOL FIVE-DIMENSIONAL QUESTIONNAIRE VISUAL ANALOG SCALE. ASSOCIATIONS WERE SOUGHT BETWEEN THESE MEASURES OF QOL AND FREQUENCY OF CRS-RELATED ORAL ANTIBIOTIC AND CORTICOSTEROID USAGE REPORTED BY THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE PRIOR 3 AND 12 MONTHS. RESULTS: MORE FREQUENT ANTIBIOTIC AND CORTICOSTEROID USE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH WORSE CRS-SPECIFIC AND GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL, WHETHER QUERYING MEDICATION USE OVER THE PRIOR 3 MONTHS OR OVER THE PRIOR 12 MONTHS (P < 0.001 IN ALL CASES). THE EFFECT SIZE OF CRS-RELATED ANTIBIOTIC USE DURING THE PRIOR 3 MONTHS ON CRS-SPECIFIC QOL (SNOT-22 SCORE) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN FOR USE DURING THE PRIOR 12 MONTHS. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO OTHER STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN EFFECT SIZE FOR ASSOCIATION BETWEEN QOL AND CRS-RELATED ANTIBIOTIC OR CORTICOSTEROID USE IN THE PRIOR 3 MONTHS VERSUS PRIOR 12 MONTHS. THESE RESULTS WERE INDEPENDENT OF THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF POLYPS. CONCLUSION: MORE FREQUENT PAST CRS-RELATED ORAL ANTIBIOTIC AND CORTICOSTEROID USE, REGARDLESS OF TIME PERIOD QUERIED (3 MONTHS OR 12 MONTHS) IS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN CRS-SPECIFIC AND GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL. CRS-RELATED SYSTEMIC MEDICATION USE IS AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF CRS PATIENTS' QOL THAT EASILY CAN BE QUERIED AND UTILIZED IN BOTH CLINICAL AND RESEARCH SETTINGS. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2C.

FEW STUDIES TO DATE HAVE COMPARED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF NASAL DOUCHING IN CRSWNP PHENOTYPES AFTER ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS). WE EVALUATED THE EFFICACY OF SEAWATER TYPES IN EOSINOPHILIC CRSWNP (ECRSWNP) AND NONEOSINOPHILIC CRSWNP (NONECRSWNP) AFTER ESS. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH BILATERAL CRSWNP WHO HAD UNDERGONE ESS WERE BLINDLY RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE BUFFERED HYPERTONIC SEAWATER (BHS) (N = 48) OR PHYSIOLOGICAL SEAWATER (PS) (N = 45). CRSWNP PATIENTS WERE STRATIFIED BY PHENOTYPES (ECRSWNP AND NONECRSWNP) RETROSPECTIVELY ACCORDING TO WHETHER TISSUE EOSINOPHILS EXCEEDED 10%. FOLLOW-UP EVALUATIONS WERE CONDUCTED AT 2, 8, 16, AND 24 WEEKS AFTER SURGERY. EVALUATIONS INCLUDED THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS), LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPIC SCORE (LKES), SACCHARINE CLEARANCE TIME (SCT), AND ADVERSE EVENTS. RESULTS: ALL OF THE PATIENTS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN SNOT-22 SCORES, VAS SCORES, AND LKES OVER TIME. BHS RESULTED IN BETTER IMPROVEMENT OF LEKS AND SCT RELATIVE TO PS AT 8 WEEKS POSTOPERATIVELY. MUCOSAL EDEMA FORMATION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED WITH LESS CRUSTING AMONG HBS RECIPIENTS AT 8 WEEKS. AFTER STRATIFICATION, ONLY PATIENTS IN THE NONECRSWNP + BHS SUBGROUP SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN LEKS AND SCT AT 8 WEEKS POSTOPERATIVELY. SIDE EFFECT PROFILES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT AMONG THE GROUPS. CONCLUSIONS: BHS HAS A BETTER INHIBITORY EFFECT ON MUCOSAL EDEMA AND CRUSTING DURING THE EARLY POSTOPERATIVE CARE PERIOD OF CRSWNP. AMONG ALL OF THE PATIENTS, NONECRSWNP PATIENTS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN LEKS AND SCT AT 8 WEEKS.","DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE FIRST AFFILIATED HOSPITAL OF NANCHANG UNIVERSITY, NANCHANG, JIANGXI PROVINCE, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE FIRST AFFILIATED HOSPITAL OF NANCHANG UNIVERSITY, NANCHANG, JIANGXI PROVINCE, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE FIRST AFFILIATED HOSPITAL OF NANCHANG UNIVERSITY, NANCHANG, JIANGXI PROVINCE, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE FIRST AFFILIATED HOSPITAL OF NANCHANG UNIVERSITY, NANCHANG, JIANGXI PROVINCE, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE FIRST AFFILIATED HOSPITAL OF NANCHANG UNIVERSITY, NANCHANG, JIANGXI PROVINCE, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE FIRST AFFILIATED HOSPITAL OF NANCHANG UNIVERSITY, NANCHANG, JIANGXI PROVINCE, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE FIRST AFFILIATED HOSPITAL OF NANCHANG UNIVERSITY, NANCHANG, JIANGXI PROVINCE, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE FIRST AFFILIATED HOSPITAL OF NANCHANG UNIVERSITY, NANCHANG, JIANGXI PROVINCE, CHINA.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: YJHOLLY@EMAIL.;NCU.;EDU.;CN.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT © 2020 ELSEVIER INC.

PARTICIPANTS: A TOTAL OF 122 PATIENTS (78 MALES, 44 FEMALES; MEAN AGE 33.5 ± 12.2 YEARS) WERE RECRUITED FROM THE SENIOR AUTHORS RHINOLOGY CLINIC AND UNDERWENT FUNCTIONAL SEPTORHINOPLASTY SURGERY. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PREOPERATIVE AND POSTOPERATIVE NASAL INSPIRATORY PEAK FLOW (NIPF) MEASUREMENTS WERE PERFORMED IN ADDITION TO THE COMPLETION OF THREE SUBJECTIVE QUALITY-OF-LIFE AND SYMPTOM ASSESSMENT TOOL QUESTIONNAIRES; SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST 22 (SNOT-22), NASAL OBSTRUCTION SYMPTOM EVALUATION (NOSE) AND VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS: 0-10). RESULTS: THE MEAN PREOPERATIVE NIPF WAS 88.2 L/MIN, AND THE POSTOPERATIVE VALUE WAS 101.6 L/MIN AND SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT FOLLOWING SURGERY (P = 0.0064). THE MEAN TOTAL SNOT-22 SCORE IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 48.6 TO 26.6 (P < 0.0001); THE NOSE SCORE FROM 14.1 TO 6.6 (P < 0.0001); AND THE VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) BLOCKAGE SCORE FROM 6.9 TO 3.2 (P < 0.0001). ALL INDIVIDUAL DOMAINS ASSESSED SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS POSTOPERATIVELY, BUT NO CORRELATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE NIPF AND SNOT-22 SCORE. EQUALLY, WE DID NOT FIND A CORRELATION BETWEEN NIPF AND THE SYMPTOM-SPECIFIC NOSE QUESTIONNAIRE AND THE NASAL BLOCKAGE DOMAIN ON THE VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) SCALE. CONCLUSION: WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT NIPF DOES NOT CORRELATE WITH THE SNOT-22 DISEASE-SPECIFIC QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTHOUGH BOTH OUTCOMES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE POSTOPERATIVELY. AT PRESENT, WE ARE STILL LACKING A CLINICALLY ACCURATE OBJECTIVE MEASURE OF NASAL FUNCTION FOR THE EVALUATION OF PATIENTS UNDERGOING SEPTORHINOPLASTY SURGERY.","DEPARTMENT OF RHINOLOGY AND FACIAL PLASTIC SURGERY, ROYAL NATIONAL THROAT NOSE AND EAR HOSPITAL, LONDON, UK.; THE EAR INSTITUTE, UCL, LONDON, UK.; DEPARTMENT OF RHINOLOGY AND FACIAL PLASTIC SURGERY, ROYAL NATIONAL THROAT NOSE AND EAR HOSPITAL, LONDON, UK.; DEPARTMENT OF RHINOLOGY AND FACIAL PLASTIC SURGERY, ROYAL NATIONAL THROAT NOSE AND EAR HOSPITAL, LONDON, UK.; DEPARTMENT OF RHINOLOGY AND FACIAL PLASTIC SURGERY, ROYAL NATIONAL THROAT NOSE AND EAR HOSPITAL, LONDON, UK.; DEPARTMENT OF RHINOLOGY AND FACIAL PLASTIC SURGERY, ROYAL NATIONAL THROAT NOSE AND EAR HOSPITAL, LONDON, UK.; DEPARTMENT OF RHINOLOGY AND FACIAL PLASTIC SURGERY, ROYAL NATIONAL THROAT NOSE AND EAR HOSPITAL, LONDON, UK.;",NA,"© 2015 JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD.",NA,NA,NA,"2015/05/07 06:00","20161018",NA,2015,"2015/05/07 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"6",NA,"1749-4486 (ELECTRONIC) 1749-4478 (LINKING)","101247023","CLINICAL OTOLARYNGOLOGY : OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF ENT-UK ; OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF NETHERLANDS SOCIETY FOR OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY & CERVICO-FACIAL SURGERY","ENG","10.1111/COA.12455 [DOI]","20191210","2016/10/19 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","698-703","ENGLAND",NA,NA,"25943502","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"CLIN OTOLARYNGOL. 2015 DEC;40(6):698-703.

A SECONDARY AIM WAS TO ASSESS WHETHER NNO LEVELS CHANGE AFTER TREATMENT OF CRS AND WHETHER THERE IS AN ASSOCIATION WITH RADIOLOGICAL FINDINGS OR SYMPTOMS. METHOD: THREE GROUPS OF 12 PARTICIPANTS EACH WERE EXAMINED: PATIENTS WITH CRS WITHOUT POLYPOSIS (CRS GROUP), PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMS OF CRS BUT RADIOLOGICALLY NORMAL SINUSES (SYMPTOMS-ONLY), AND HEALTHY CONTROLS. MEASUREMENTS OF NNO WERE CARRIED OUT USING ASPIRATION METHOD AND HUMMING MANEUVER. ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). A SECOND NNO MEASUREMENT WAS DONE AFTER TREATMENT IN THE CRS GROUP (N = 9) AND THE HEALTHY CONTROL GROUP (N = 12). RESULTS: NASAL NO DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN ANY OF THE GROUPS WITH ANY OF THE MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES. THERE WAS A TREND TOWARD LOWER NNO VALUES IN THE CRS GROUP COMPARED WITH THE SYMPTOMS-ONLY GROUP AND HEALTHY CONTROLS, BUT IT DID NOT REACH STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. THE SNOT-22 DEMONSTRATED INFERIOR VALUES FOR THE CRS AND SYMPTOMS-ONLY GROUPS COMPARED WITH THE HEALTHY CONTROLS. AT FOLLOW-UP, NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WAS FOUND FOR THE NNO MEASUREMENTS IN EITHER GROUP. CONCLUSION: IRRESPECTIVE OF OCCLUDED OR OPEN OSTIOMEATAL COMPLEXES, NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN NNO WERE FOUND IN CRS COMPARED WITH HEALTHY CONTROLS USING ASPIRATION AND HUMMING METHODS. TREATMENT OF CRS IMPROVED SINUS PATENCY WITHOUT ACCOMPANYING A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN NNO.

HOWEVER, NO STUDY HAS INVESTIGATED WHETHER CRS SEVERITY AFFECTS THE DEGREE OF ASTHMA CONTROL. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT SIZE OF AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN CRS SEVERITY AND ASTHMA CONTROL. METHODS: A PILOT STUDY WITH A PROSPECTIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL DESIGN. ADULT PATIENTS WITH CRS AND ASTHMA WERE RECRUITED. CRS SEVERITY WAS MEASURED USING THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOMES TEST (SNOT-22), AND ASTHMA CONTROL WAS MEASURED USING THE ASTHMA CONTROL TEST (ACT). POOR ASTHMA CONTROL WAS DEFINED AS AN ACT SCORE OF 19 OR LESS. IN ADDITION TO AGE AND SEX, WE ALSO ASSESSED THE PARTICIPANTS' HISTORY OF SMOKING, AEROALLERGEN HYPERSENSITIVITY, THE PRESENCE OF POLYPS, AND CURRENT USE OF A CORTICOSTEROID-CONTAINING ASTHMA INHALER. THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SNOT-22 AND ACT WAS ASSESSED USING UNIVARIATE AND MULTIVARIABLE LINEAR REGRESSION. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 40 PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED. THE MEAN (SD) SNOT-22 SCORE WAS 43.6 (23.6), AND THE MEAN (SD) ACT SCORE WAS 20.6 (4.8). WE FOUND THAT THE SNOT-22 SCORE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACT SCORE (ADJUSTED <U+0392> = -0.07; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], -0.13 TO -0.02; P = .02) AND WITH HAVING POOR ASTHMA CONTROL (ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.11; P = .02).

CONCLUSION: CRS SEVERITY IS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH ASTHMA CONTROL IN PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA AND CRS.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE MEASUREMENT PERFORMANCE OF THE SNOT-22 INSTRUMENT ON AN ITEM-LEVEL BASIS, IN A SAMPLE OF PATIENTS AWAITING ELECTIVE SURGERY FOR CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS. METHODS: THIS STUDY INVOLVED SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF SNOT-22 DATA THAT WAS PROSPECTIVELY COLLECTED FROM PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS AND AWAITING ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY IN VANCOUVER, CANADA. THIS STUDY USED CLASSIC TEST THEORY AND A 2-PARAMETER GRADED-RESPONSE MODEL TO EVALUATE THE SNOT-22 ITEMS' ABILITIES TO MEASURE THE SEVERITY OF CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS IN TERMS OF PATIENTS' SELF-REPORTED SYMPTOMS. THIS APPROACH MODELS EACH ITEM'S DISCRIMINABILITY AND DIFFICULTY, WHICH PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO HOW WELL THEY RESPECTIVELY MEASURE SYMPTOMS RELATED TO CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS. RESULTS: FACTOR ANALYSES INDICATED THAT THERE ARE 5 DOMAINS OF MEASUREMENT IN THE SNOT-22. THE MAJORITY OF ITEMS DEMONSTRATED STRONG DISCRIMINABILITY BETWEEN SYMPTOM SEVERITIES. LIKEWISE, MOST OF THE ITEMS DEMONSTRATED STRONG DIFFICULTY MEASURING THE SYMPTOMS ACROSS THEIR RANGE OF LEVELS. THE EXCEPTION WAS THOSE ITEMS RELATED TO PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS. DIFFERENTIAL ITEM FUNCTIONING DEMONSTRATED THAT VERY FEW OF THE SNOT-22 ITEMS WERE ANSWERED SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENTLY BY GENDER OR AGE SUBGROUPS. CONCLUSION: THIS ITEM-LEVEL ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATES THAT, IN GENERAL, THE SNOT-22 IS A STRONG INSTRUMENT.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER BASELINE DISEASE-SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) CAN ASSIST IN PREDICTING OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY CRS WHO ELECT CONTINUED MEDICAL MANAGEMENT. METHODS: CRS PATIENTS ELECTING MEDICAL MANAGEMENT WERE ENROLLED IN A PROSPECTIVE, MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL COHORT STUDY. PATIENTS WERE STRATIFIED INTO PRETREATMENT 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SUBGROUPS BASED ON 10-POINT SCORE INCREMENTS (EG, 10 TO 19, 20 TO 29, 30 TO 39, ETC.)

THE PROPORTION OF PATIENTS ACHIEVING MINIMAL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE (MCID=9 POINTS) AND RELATIVE IMPROVEMENT (%) FOR EACH SCORE CATEGORY WERE CALCULATED. RESULTS: SEVENTY-FIVE CRS PATIENTS WITH A MEAN ± STANDARD DEVIATION PRETREATMENT SNOT-22 SCORE OF 45.2 ± 16.6 WERE FOLLOWED FOR A MEAN OF 14.9 MONTHS. THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS ELECTING MEDICAL THERAPY FAILED TO IMPROVE 1 MCID (57%) WITH A MEAN RELATIVE SCORE IMPROVEMENT OF 16%.

WE AIMED TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER COMORBID ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, WHICH ARE HIGHLY PREVALENT IN PATIENTS WITH CRS MAY CAUSE SYMPTOM AMPLIFICATION AND ACCOUNT FOR THE LACK OF CORRELATION IN PREVIOUS STUDIES. METHODOLOGY: 100 PATIENTS WITH CRS WERE EVALUATED USING THE GENERAL ANXIETY DISORDER-7 (GAD-7), PATIENT HEALTH QUESTION- NAIRE-9 (PHQ-9) AND SNOT-22 QUESTIONNAIRES AS WELL AS THE LUND MACKAY SCORE (LMS). RESULTS: OVERALL CORRELATION ANALYSIS DID NOT SHOW A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SNOT-22 AND LMS SCORES. SUBGROUP ANALYSIS OF PATIENTS WHO DO NOT SUFFER WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION BETWEEN SNOT-22 AND LMS SCORES. THE NASAL DOMAIN OF THE SNOT-22 SHOWED STRONGEST CORRELATION TO LMS IN THIS PATIENT GROUP. WE ALSO OBSERVED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN BOTH MEDIAN SNOT-22 AND LMS BETWEEN PATIENTS WHO SUFFERED BOTH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AND PATIENTS WITHOUT EITHER CO- MORBIDITY. CONCLUSION: WHEN CRS PATIENTS WHO DO NOT HAVE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION ARE ANALYSED IN ISOLATION, OR WHEN THESE CONDITIONS ARE CONTROLLED IN A MULTIVARIABLE REGRESSION, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION BETWEEN RADIOLOGICAL FINDINGS AND SYMPTOM SCORE. THIS CORRELATION IS ABSENT IN PATIENTS WITH CO-MORBID ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN PATIENTS IN WHOM THERE IS A MISMATCH IN SYMPTOM AND RADIOLOGICAL DISEASE SEVERITY AS IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH SYMPTOM AMPLIFICATION.","DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, GUYÂ€™S AND ST THOMASÂ€™ UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, GUYÂ€™S AND ST THOMASÂ€™ UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, GUYÂ€™S AND ST THOMASÂ€™ UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, GUYÂ€™S AND ST THOMASÂ€™ UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, GUYÂ€™S AND ST THOMASÂ€™ UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, GUYÂ€™S AND ST THOMASÂ€™ UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, GUYÂ€™S AND ST THOMASÂ€™ UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020/07/02 06:00","20210201",NA,2020,"2020/07/02 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"6",NA,"0300-0729 (PRINT) 0300-0729 (LINKING)","0347242","RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.4193/RHIN20.075 [DOI]","20210201","2021/02/02 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","568-573","NETHERLANDS",NA,NA,"32609104","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"RHINOLOGY. 2020 DEC 1;58(6):568-573.

CONVENTIONALLY, THE TREATMENT FOR THESE PATIENTS IS SURGICAL METHOD FOR CRSWNP FOLLOWED BY TREATMENT WITH A NASAL STEROID SPRAY OR OTHER ANTIALLERGIC DRUGS TO CONTROL AR. IN RECENT YEARS, SOME RHINOLOGISTS INTRODUCED VIDIAN NEURECTOMY (VN) OR POSTERIOR NASAL NEURECTOMY (PNN) INTO ENDOSCOPY TO TREAT REFRACTORY AR AND REPORTED AN ENCOURAGING OUTCOME. FURTHERMORE, WE EXPLORE THE CONTROL OF RECURRENCE OF NASAL POLYPS AND IMPROVEMENT IN SYMPTOMS AFTER ENDOSCOPIC PNN FOR THE TREATMENT OF ARWCRSWNP. OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE THE CONTROL OF RECURRENCE OF NASAL POLYPS AND IMPROVEMENT IN SYMPTOMS AFTER ENDOSCOPIC PNN FOR THE TREATMENT OF ARWCRSWNP. METHODS: EIGHTY-FIVE PATIENTS WITH ARWCRSWNP WHO WERE ADMITTED TO OUR HOSPITAL FROM NOVEMBER 2016 TO JULY 2018 WERE ENROLLED IN TWO GROUPS. GROUP A UNDERWENT CONVENTIONAL FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUSITIS SURGERY (FESS) COMBINED WITH PNN; GROUP B UNDERWENT CONVENTIONAL FESS ALONE. VAS, RQLQ, SNOT-22 AND POSTOPERATIVE NASAL ENDOSCOPY WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE IMPROVEMENT IN SYMPTOMS AND THE RECURRENCE OF NASAL POLYPS. RESULTS: THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP HAD BETTER CONTROL OF SNEEZING (P < .05) AND RHINORRHEA (P < .01) THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. FOR THOSE WHO UNDERWENT SURGERY MORE THAN 6 MONTHS PRIOR IN BOTH GROUPS, THE RECURRENCE RATE WAS 29.6% (8/27) IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND 44.4% (8/18) IN THE CONTROL GROUP, AND THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (<U+03A7>(2) = .483, P = .487). CONCLUSION: FESS COMBINED WITH PNN CAN IMPROVE THE SYMPTOMS OF SNEEZING AND RHINORRHEA CAUSED BY ARWCRSWNP MORE OBVIOUSLY THAN FESS ALONE, BUT THERE IS NO CLEAR STATISTICAL ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROCEDURE FOR IMPROVING THE OVERALL SYMPTOMS AND CONTROLLING THE RECURRENCE OF NASAL POLYPS.","DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, SECOND HOSPITAL OF JILIN UNIVERSITY , CHANGCHUN , JILIN , CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, SECOND HOSPITAL OF JILIN UNIVERSITY , CHANGCHUN , JILIN , CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, SECOND HOSPITAL OF JILIN UNIVERSITY , CHANGCHUN , JILIN , CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, SECOND HOSPITAL OF JILIN UNIVERSITY , CHANGCHUN , JILIN , CHINA.; ADELAIDE ENT SURGERY, THE UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE , ADELAIDE , SA , AUSTRALIA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, SECOND HOSPITAL OF JILIN UNIVERSITY , CHANGCHUN , JILIN , CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, SECOND HOSPITAL OF JILIN UNIVERSITY , CHANGCHUN , JILIN , CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, SECOND HOSPITAL OF JILIN UNIVERSITY , CHANGCHUN , JILIN , CHINA.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019/08/28 06:00","20200221","20190827",2019,"2019/08/28 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"10",NA,"1651-2251 (ELECTRONIC) 0001-6489 (LINKING)","0370354","ACTA OTO-LARYNGOLOGICA","ENG","10.1080/00016489.2019.1654132 [DOI]","20200221","2020/02/23 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","890-894","ENGLAND",NA,NA,"31452425","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"ACTA OTOLARYNGOL. 2019 OCT;139(10):890-894.

OBJECTIVE: TO PROSPECTIVELY EVALUATE WHETHER TREATMENT WITH THE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY AGAINST IGE OMALIZUMAB FOR SEVERE ALLERGIC ASTHMA ALSO EFFECTIVELY TREATS CO-EXISTENT CRSWNP. METHODS: SNOT-22 AND THE ACQ-7 SCORES WERE RECORDED AT 4 AND 16 WEEKS OF TREATMENT IN A COHORT OF PATIENTS WITH BOTH CRSWNP AND SEVERE REFRACTORY ALLERGIC ASTHMA TREATED WITH OMALIZUMAB (N=13) ACCORDING TO UK GUIDELINES FOR THEIR SEVERE ASTHMA. SNOT-22 IN A SURGERY ONLY TREATED CRSWNP WITH ASTHMA GROUP (N=24) WAS COMPARED. RESULTS: RAPID IMPROVEMENT WAS SEEN AT 4 WEEKS AND 16 WEEKS OF TREATMENT IN BOTH CRSWNP AND ASTHMA CONTROL. THE IMPROVEMENT IN CRSWNP WITH OMALIZUMAB WAS SIMILAR TO THAT SEEN IN A GROUP OF PATIENTS WHO RECEIVED UPPER AIRWAY SURGERY. CONCLUSION: OMALIZUMAB TREATMENT FOR SEVERE ALLERGIC ASTHMA ALSO IMPROVES CO-EXISTENT CRSWNP. FURTHER CLINICAL STUDIES OF CURRENT AND EMERGING BIOLOGICAL AGENTS FOR SEVERE ASTHMA SHOULD INCLUDE UPPER AIRWAY OUTCOMES.

THE MUCOSAL BASEMENT MEMBRANE (BM) AND CILIA ARE BELIEVED TO PLAY ROLES IN CRS PATHOGENESIS BY IMPACTING MUCOCILIARY CLEARANCE AND IMMUNE BARRIERS. THIS STUDY AIMED TO IDENTIFY CLINICAL, SURGICAL, AND HISTOPATHOLOGICAL SUBTYPE DIFFERENCES TO FURTHER ELUCIDATE DISEASE MECHANISMS. METHODS: ETHMOID TISSUE FROM 33 ADULT CRS PATIENTS AND 7 CONTROLS WAS OBTAINED DURING ENDOSCOPIC SINUS OR OTHER SINONASAL SURGERY (CONTROLS) AND ANALYZED BY LIGHT AND TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY FOR BM THICKNESS AND PRESENCE OF CILIA. CRS PATIENTS WERE CATEGORIZED INTO THE 4 SUBTYPES, AND 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORE, ENDOSCOPY, COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT), AND SURGICAL DATA WERE COMPARED AND ANALYZED FOR ASSOCIATION WITH HISTOPATHOLOGY MEASURES. RESULTS: CRS SUBTYPES COULD BE DISTINGUISHED BY CT SCORE AND SURGICAL DATA, WITH ECRSWNP PATIENTS EXHIBITING GREATEST DISEASE SEVERITY. WHEREAS EOSINOPHILIA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH ABSENCE OF CILIA, NASAL POLYPOSIS SHOWED NO ASSOCIATION WITH SURGICAL OR HISTOPATHOLOGICAL MEASURES. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN BM THICKNESS WAS FOUND BETWEEN CONTROLS AND CRS SUBTYPES, BUT DISTINCTIONS WERE FOUND REGARDING CILIA, WHICH WERE LESS COMMON IN EOSINOPHILIC SUBGROUPS COMPARED TO CONTROLS AND NECRSSNP PATIENTS. CONCLUSION: CRS SUBTYPES EXHIBIT SOME DIFFERENTIATING HISTOPATHOLOGICAL AND SURGICAL FEATURES. THE ABSENCE OF CILIA APPEARS TO HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE EOSINOPHILIC SUBGROUPS.

OBJECTIVES: TO STUDY THE DEGREE OF CRS CONTROL USING NOVEL EPOS CONTROL CRITERIA AT 3-5 YEARS AFTER A FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (FESS) AND CORRELATE THESE DATA TO SYMPTOMS SCORES. METHODS: ADULT CRS PATIENTS (N = 560) WHO HAD UNDERGONE BILATERAL FESS FOR CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY SINONASAL DISEASE 3-5 YEARS PRIOR TO THE STUDY WERE INCLUDED. PATIENTS RECEIVED A POSTAL QUESTIONNAIRE ASKING FOR CONTROL ITEMS ACCORDING TO EPOS CONTROL CRITERIA, VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) SCORES FOR TOTAL AND INDIVIDUAL SINONASAL SYMPTOMS, SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT)-22 AND SHORT FORM (SF)-36 QUESTIONNAIRES. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: ABOUT 19.5% OF CRS PATIENTS WERE WELL CONTROLLED, WITH 36.8% OF PATIENTS BEING PARTLY CONTROLLED AND 43.7% UNCONTROLLED. THE LEVELS OF CONTROL CORRESPONDED TO MEAN TOTAL VAS, SNOT-22 AND SF-36 SCORES. SUBGROUP ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT FEMALE GENDER, ASPIRIN INTOLERANCE AND REVISION FESS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER PREVALENCE OF UNCONTROLLED CRS, WHEREAS ALLERGY, ASTHMA AND SMOKING STATUS DID NOT ALTER THE PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS IN EACH CATEGORY OF CONTROL. IN 81 PATIENTS ATTENDING THE OUTPATIENT CLINIC, NASAL ENDOSCOPY CHANGED CLASSIFICATION IN ONLY FOUR PATIENTS (4.9%). CONCLUSIONS: BASED ON THE NOVEL EPOS CONTROL CRITERIA, AT LEAST 40% OF CRS PATIENTS ARE UNCONTROLLED AT 3-5 YEARS AFTER FESS. THEREFORE, BETTER TREATMENT STRATEGIES LEADING TO HIGHER DISEASE CONTROL ARE WARRANTED IN CRS CARE.","DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UZ LEUVEN, LEUVEN, BELGIUM.; LABORATORY OF CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY, UZ LEUVEN, LEUVEN, BELGIUM.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UZ LEUVEN, LEUVEN, BELGIUM.; ENT CLINIC MESSIDOR, BRUSSELS, BELGIUM.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UZ LEUVEN, LEUVEN, BELGIUM.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER, AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UZ LEUVEN, LEUVEN, BELGIUM.; LABORATORY OF CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY, UZ LEUVEN, LEUVEN, BELGIUM.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER, AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF GHENT, GHENT, BELGIUM.;",NA,"© 2016 THE AUTHORS.

STUDY DESIGN: OBSERVATIONAL OUTCOMES STUDY. SETTING: TERTIARY CARE CENTER. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: WE ASSESSED PATIENTS PRESENTING WITH CHRONIC SINONASAL COMPLAINTS WHO UNDERWENT CT OF THE SINUSES WITHIN 1 MONTH OF COMPLETING THE SNOT-22 INSTRUMENT. SNOT-22 OVERALL AND DOMAIN SCORES WERE CALCULATED, AS WERE LUND-MACKAY CT SCORES. THE DISCRIMINATORY CAPACITY OF SNOT-22 SCORES FOR CT RESULTS WAS DETERMINED USING THE RECEIVER-OPERATOR CHARACTERISTIC AREA UNDER THE CURVE (ROC-AUC). PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME MEASUREMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PROMIS) MENTAL HEALTH T-SCORES WERE ASSESSED, AND STRATIFIED ANALYSES WERE USED TO TEST FOR EFFECT MODIFICATION BY PSYCHOLOGICAL STATUS. RESULTS: IN STRATIFIED ANALYSES, PATIENTS WITH BETTER PROMIS MENTAL HEALTH SCORES HAD SNOT-22 OVERALL (ROC-AUC 0.96) AND NASAL DOMAIN SCORES (ROC-AUC 0.97-0.98) THAT WERE HIGHLY DISCRIMINATORY FOR LUND-MACKAY SCORES, WHILE THOSE WITH WORSE MENTAL HEALTH SCORES DID NOT (ROC-AUC 0.42-0.55, P < .007).

CONCLUSIONS: PSYCHOLOGICAL STATUS IS AN EFFECT MODIFIER OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SNOT-22 AND LUND-MACKAY SCORES. SNOT-22 SCORES WERE DISCRIMINATORY FOR LUND-MACKAY CT RESULTS IN PATIENTS WITH BETTER PSYCHOLOGICAL STATUS, WHILE THEY WERE NONDISCRIMINATORY IN THOSE WITH WORSE PSYCHOLOGICAL STATUS.

AIMS: WE SOUGHT TO DETERMINE THE PREVALENCE OF POTENTIAL CLINICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC CRS-MODIFYING CHARACTERISTICS AND THEIR ASSOCIATIONS WITH CRS SYMPTOM SEVERITY IN A LARGE CONTEMPORARY COHORT OF CRS PATIENTS. METHODS: RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF CRS PATIENTS WHO VISITED OUR RHINOLOGY CLINICS BETWEEN FEBRUARY 2016 AND FEBRUARY 2017 WAS CONDUCTED. CRS SYMPTOM SEVERITY WAS MEASURED USING THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOMES TEST (SNOT-22) QUESTIONNAIRE, WHICH ALL PATIENTS RECEIVED. ASSOCIATION WAS SOUGHT BETWEEN SNOT-22 SCORE (AS DEPENDENT VARIABLE) AND PATIENTS' CLINICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS USING LINEAR REGRESSION. RESULTS: OF THE 572 INCLUDED PATIENTS, THE MEAN AGE WAS 51.1 YEARS (SD = 15.8) AND THE MEAN SNOT-22 SCORE WAS 34.3 (SD = 22.6).

THE NOSE PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SRBD; THUS, THE MEASUREMENT OF NASAL RESPIRATORY FUNCTION REMAINS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THESE PATIENTS. PEAK NASAL INSPIRATORY FLOW (PNIF) IS A USEFUL TOOL TO ASSESS NASAL AIRFLOW AND IT HAS RECENTLY BEEN STUDIED TOGETHER WITH PEAK ORAL INSPIRATORY FLOW (POIF). OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE ROLE OF PNIF AND POIF IN AN ADULT POPULATION OF PATIENTS AFFECTED BY SRBD. METHODOLOGY: SEVENTY CONSECUTIVE ADULT PATIENTS WITH SRBD WERE INCLUDED IN THE PRESENT STUDY. ALL PATIENTS WERE EVALUATED WITH HOME-BASED SLEEP STUDIES (TYPE III), PNIF, POIF, SNOT-22 QUESTIONNAIRE, EPWORTH SLEEPINESS SCALE TEST AND VAS FOR NASAL OBSTRUCTION. RESULTS: ALTHOUGH PNIF AND POIF SHOWED TO CORRELATE WITH EACH OTHER, NO CORRELATIONS WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN APNEA HYPOPNEA INDEX (AHI) AND PNIF, POIF OR NPI (PNIF/POIF). A FURTHER ANALYSIS SHOWED A MARGINAL CORRELATION BETWEEN SNOT- 22 AND AHI AND BETWEEN SNOT-22 AND POIF. FURTHERMORE, IN A MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS, ALSO POIF MARGINALLY CORRELATED WITH SOME OF THE SLEEP- RELATED SNOT-22 ITEMS. CONCLUSIONS: IN THE PRESENT STUDY NEITHER PNIF NOR POIF WERE FOUND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH OSAS SEVERITY. HOWEVER, POIF VALUES CORRELATED BETTER THAN PNIF WITH SLEEP RELATED SYMPTOMS SUGGESTING THAT POIF COULD BE A MORE USEFUL PARAMETER FOR UPPER AIRWAY ASSESSMENT IN PATIENTS WITH SRBD.

DRAMATIC RESPONSES TO MACROLIDE IN THE UPPER AIRWAY ARE SEEN BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PATIENT PHENOTYPE PREDISPOSING TO MACROLIDE RESPONSE IN CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS) IS POOR. METHODS: A CASE CONTROL STUDY WAS PERFORMED IN A TERTIARY LEVEL RHINOLOGY PRACTICE OF CONSECUTIVE CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS PATIENTS PLACED ON A 3-MONTH LOW DOSE MACROLIDE THERAPY AFTER FAILING AT LEAST 3 MONTHS OF CORTICOSTEROID IRRIGATION THERAPY POST-ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY. PATIENTS WERE DEFINED AS A MACROLIDE RESPONDER WHEN HAVING NEAR NORMAL ENDOSCOPY AFTER A 3-MONTH PERIOD OF CLARITHROMYCIN TREATMENT. PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS OF SMOKING, ASTHMA, ATOPY STATUS, REVISION SURGERY, SYMPTOM SEVERITY (SNOT-22) ALONG WITH BIOMARKERS FROM SERUM AND TISSUE HISTOPATHOLOGY RESULTS WERE COMPARED BETWEEN GROUPS. RESULTS: OF TWENTY-EIGHT CONSECUTIVE MACROLIDE TREATED PATIENTS, 19 RESPONDERS WERE COMPARED TO 9 NON-RESPONDERS. THE GROUPS WERE SIMILAR IN AGE, FEMALE GENDER, NON-SMOKING, ASTHMA, AND ATOPY. MACROLIDE RESPONSE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A LACK OF TISSUE EOSINOPHILIA (MORE THAN 10/HPF) AND LOWER SERUM EOSINOPHILIA. NEUTROPHIL EXPRESSION WAS SIMILAR IN TISSUE AND SERUM. SQUAMOUS METAPLASIA WAS OVEREXPRESSED IN NON-RESPONDERS. CONCLUSION: LOW TISSUE AND SERUM EOSINOPHILIA, AND ABSENCE OF TISSUE SQUAMOUS METAPLASIA MAY PREDICT A CRS PHENOTYPE SUITABLE TO A TRIAL OF LONG-TERM MACROLIDE THERAPY WHEN SURGERY AND TOPICAL THERAPY HAS FAILED.","DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF UTAH, SALT LAKE CITY, UT, USA.; RHINOLOGY AND SKULL BASE RESEARCH GROUP, ST VINCENTS CENTRE FOR APPLIED MEDICAL RESEARCH, UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.; FACULTY OF MEDICINE AND HEALTH SCIENCES, MACQUARIE UNIVERSITY, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.; DEPARTMENT OF ANATOMICAL PATHOLOGY, ST.; VINCENTS HOSPITAL, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.; RHINOLOGY AND SKULL BASE RESEARCH GROUP, ST VINCENTS CENTRE FOR APPLIED MEDICAL RESEARCH, UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018/02/25 06:00","20181025",NA,2018,"2018/02/25 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,"0300-0729 (PRINT) 0300-0729 (LINKING)","0347242","RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.4193/RHIN17.049 [DOI]","20181025","2018/10/26 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","111-117","NETHERLANDS",NA,NA,"29476191","PPUBLISH","0 (ANTI-BACTERIAL AGENTS) 0 (MACROLIDES)","IM",NA,"RHINOLOGY. 2018 JUN 1;56(2):111-117.

WE DEVELOPED A \"MODIFIED LUND MACKAY\" (MLM) SYSTEM, WHICH USES A THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D), COMPUTERIZED METHOD TO QUANTIFY THE VOLUME OF MUCOSAL INFLAMMATION IN THE SINUSES, AND SOUGHT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE MLM WOULD CORRELATE WITH SYMPTOMS AND DISEASE-SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE. METHODS: WE OBTAINED TOTAL NASAL SYMPTOM SCORE (TNSS) AND 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) DATA FROM 55 ADULT SUBJECTS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO SINUS IMAGING. THE VOLUME OF EACH SINUS OCCUPIED BY MUCOSAL INFLAMMATION WAS MEASURED USING MATLAB ALGORITHMS CREATED USING CUSTOMIZED, IMAGE ANALYSIS SOFTWARE AFTER MANUAL OUTLINING OF EACH SINUS. LINEAR REGRESSION WAS USED TO MODEL THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MLM AND THE SNOT-22 AND TNSS. CORRELATION BETWEEN THE LM AND MLM WAS TESTED USING SPEARMAN'S RANK CORRELATION COEFFICIENT. RESULTS: ADJUSTING FOR AGE, GENDER, AND SMOKING, A HIGHER SYMPTOM BURDEN WAS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED SINONASAL INFLAMMATION AS CAPTURED BY THE MLM (<U+0392> = 0.453, P < 0.013). AS EXPECTED DUE TO THE DIFFERENCES IN SCALES, THE LM AND MLM SCORES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT (P < 0.011). NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MLM AND SNOT-22 SCORES WAS FOUND. CONCLUSION: THE MLM IS ONE OF THE FIRST IMAGING-BASED SCORING SYSTEMS THAT CORRELATES WITH SINONASAL SYMPTOMS.

OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE DIFFERENCES IN QUALITY-OF-LIFE (QOL) OUTCOMES FOR A COHORT OF PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS) FOR CRS. METHODS: THIS RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW INCLUDED PATIENTS WITH CRS WHO UNDERWENT ESS BETWEEN 2010 AND 2013. QOL WAS MEASURED BY USING THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). VARIABLES COLLECTED INCLUDED BASELINE DEMOGRAPHICS, SNOT-22 SCORES BEFORE ESS AND AT 1, 3, 6, 9, AND 12 MONTHS AFTER ESS. GROUPS TESTED WERE CRS WITH NASAL POLYPOSIS, CRS WITHOUT NASAL POLYPOSIS (CRSSNP), AND PATIENTS WITH AFRS.

METHODS: THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL CASE-CONTROL STUDY ENROLLED 71 PATIENTS-44 AAV CASES WITH (EAR, NOSE, AND THROAT [ENT]-AAV) OR WITHOUT ENT INVOLVEMENT (NON-ENT-AAV) UNDERGOING MULTIDISCIPLINARY EVALUATIONS AND 27 CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS) CASES. THREE VALIDATED QOL QUESTIONNAIRES (SINO-NASAL OUTCOMES TEST-22 [SNOT-22], NASAL OBSTRUCTION SYMPTOM EVALUATION [NOSE], AND SHORT-FORM 36) WERE ADMINISTERED, AND THE 3 GROUPS WERE COMPARED. RESULTS: THE ENT-AAV PATIENTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY YOUNGER (P = 0.01), WITH LESS ANTINEUTROPHIL CYTOPLASMIC ANTIBODY POSITIVITY FREQUENCY (P = 0.035) AND LOWER RENAL INVOLVEMENT (P = 0.003) THAN THE NON-ENT-AAV PATIENTS.THE SNOT-22 QUESTIONNAIRE DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER SINONASAL MORBIDITY IN ENT-AAV PATIENTS COMPARED WITH CRS PATIENTS (P < 0.001). THE NOSE SCORE OF ENT-AAV PATIENTS WAS COMPARABLE TO THOSE OF CRS PATIENTS, BUT HIGHER THAN THAT OF NON-ENT-AAV PATIENTS (P < 0.001). THE SNOT-22 AND NOSE SCORES POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH DISEASE ACTIVITY (P = 0.037; P = 0.004, RESPECTIVELY).

NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN QOL CAME TO LIGHT WHEN AAV PATIENTS WERE STRATIFIED ACCORDING TO CURRENT SYSTEMIC O LOCAL TREATMENTS. CONCLUSIONS: THE QOL IN AAV PATIENTS IS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED, ESPECIALLY IN THE PRESENCE OF ENT INVOLVEMENT. THE AAV-RELATED NASAL MORBIDITY IS CONSISTENT AND COMPARABLE TO THAT REPORTED BY CRS PATIENTS. IT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS PATIENTS' QOL AND IN PARTICULAR SOCIAL FUNCTIONING, LEADING TO LIMITATION IN DAILY/WORK ACTIVITIES.

THEREFORE, WE EXAMINED THE BENEFITS OF ADDING CLARITHROMYCIN TO ORAL PRED- NISOLONE AS POST-ESS MEDICAL THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP. METHODS: IN THIS RANDOMISED, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL, PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED AND ALLOCATED TO THREE STUDY GROUPS RECEIVING DIFFERENT POST-ESS MEDICAL THERAPIES: GROUP A (PLACEBO FOR 14 WEEKS), GROUP B (ORAL PREDNISOLONE [15 MG TWICE DAILY] FOR 2 WEEKS, FOLLOWED BY PLACEBO FOR 12 WEEKS), AND GROUP C (ORAL PREDNISOLONE [15 MG TWICE DAILY] FOR 2 WEEKS, FOLLOWED BY CLARI- THROMYCIN [500 MG DAILY] FOR 12 WEEKS). ALL ENROLLED PATIENTS RECEIVED THE PERIOPERATIVE CARE FOLLOWING A ROUTINE PROTOCOL, WHICH INCLUDED ORAL AMOXICILLIN/CLAVULANATE, AND INTRANASAL CORTICOSTEROID SPRAY. THE BASELINE AND POST-OPERATIVE VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) SCORES, SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES, AND LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPY SCORES (LKES) WERE DETERMINED AS THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES. RESULTS: ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-SIX PATIENTS WHO RECEIVED ESS FOR BILATERAL CRSWNP WERE RANDOMISED INTO GROUP A (N=43), B (N=42), OR C (N=41). COMPARED TO GROUPS A AND B, GROUP C SHOWED GREATER VAS AND SNOT-22 SCORE IMPROVEMENT AT 12 WEEKS AFTER ESS. GROUP C SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER LKES THAN DID GROUPS A AND B AT 8, 12, AND 24 WEEKS AFTER ESS. ON STRATIFYING THE LKES RESULTS ACCORDING TO THE PRESENCE/ABSENCE OF TISSUE EOSINOPHILIA, GREATER ADD-ON EFFECTS OF CLARITHROMYCIN WERE OBSERVED IN THE PATIENT SUBGROUP WITHOUT TISSUE EOSINOPHILIA.

HOWEVER, NO STUDY HAS VALIDATED THE SUBDOMAIN STRUCTURE OF THE SNOT-22. THIS STUDY AIMS TO VALIDATE THE EXISTENCE OF UNDERLYING SYMPTOM SUBDOMAINS OF THE SNOT-22 USING CONFIRMATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS (CFA) AND TO DEVELOP A SUBDOMAIN MODEL THAT PRACTITIONERS AND RESEARCHERS CAN USE TO DESCRIBE CRS SYMPTOMATOLOGY. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 800 PATIENTS WITH CRS WERE INCLUDED INTO THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY (400 CRS PATIENTS FROM BOSTON, MA, AND 400 CRS PATIENTS FROM RENO, NV). THEIR SNOT-22 RESPONSES WERE ANALYZED USING EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS (EFA) TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF SYMPTOM SUBDOMAINS. A CFA WAS PERFORMED TO DEVELOP A VALIDATED MEASUREMENT MODEL FOR THE UNDERLYING SNOT-22 SUBDOMAINS ALONG WITH VARIOUS TESTS OF VALIDITY AND GOODNESS OF FIT. RESULTS: EFA DEMONSTRATED 4 DISTINCT FACTORS REFLECTING: SLEEP, NASAL, OTOLOGIC/FACIAL PAIN, AND EMOTIONAL SYMPTOMS (CRONBACH'S ALPHA, >0.7; BARTLETT'S TEST OF SPHERICITY, P < 0.001; KAISER-MEYER-OLKIN >0.90), INDEPENDENT OF GEOGRAPHIC LOCALE. THE CORRESPONDING CFA MEASUREMENT MODEL DEMONSTRATED EXCELLENT MEASURES OF FIT (ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR OF APPROXIMATION, <0.06; STANDARDIZED ROOT MEAN SQUARE RESIDUAL, <0.08; COMPARATIVE FIT INDEX, >0.95; TUCKER-LEWIS INDEX, >0.95) AND MEASURES OF CONSTRUCT VALIDITY (HETEROTRAIT-MONOTRAIT [HTMT] RATIO, <0.85; COMPOSITE RELIABILITY, >0.7), AGAIN INDEPENDENT OF GEOGRAPHIC LOCALE. CONCLUSION: THE USE OF THE 4-SUBDOMAIN STRUCTURE FOR SNOT-22 (REFLECTING SLEEP, NASAL, OTOLOGIC/FACIAL PAIN, AND EMOTIONAL SYMPTOMS OF CRS) WAS VALIDATED AS THE MOST APPROPRIATE TO CALCULATE SNOT-22 SUBDOMAIN SCORES FOR PATIENTS FROM DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS USING CFA.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, BOSTON, MA.; SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA, RENO, RENO, NV.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, BOSTON, MA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, BOSTON, MA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, BOSTON, MA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, BOSTON, MA.; DEPARTAMENTO DE OTORRINOLARINGOLOGIA E CIRURGIA DE CABEÇA E PESCOÇO (DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY AND HEAD AND NECK SURGERY), UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE SÃO PAOLO, SÃO PAULO, BRAZIL.; SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA, RENO, RENO, NV.; NEVADA ENT AND HEARING ASSOCIATES, RENO, NV.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MA.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER, BOSTON, MA.; SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA, RENO, RENO, NV.; NEVADA ENT AND HEARING ASSOCIATES, RENO, NV.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, BOSTON, MA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, BOSTON, MA.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER, BOSTON, MA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY AND COMMUNICATIONS ENHANCEMENT, BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, BOSTON, MA.;","ORCID: 0000-0002-8040-5299 ORCID: 0000-0001-6331-2325","© 2017 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2017/10/14 06:00","20180718","20171013",2017,"2017/10/14 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"12",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.22025 [DOI]","20180725","2018/07/19 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","1140-1148","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"29028287","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2017 DEC;7(12):1140-1148.

THE DATA WILL PROVIDE A DETAILED OVERVIEW OF THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT ON PATIENTS'WELL-BEING, AND HOW IT COMPARES WITH THE NORMAL, HEALTHY POPULATION. METHODS: SUITABLE PATIENTS WERE PROSPECTIVELY IDENTIFIED FROM THE MULTI-DISCIPLINARY FACIAL PAIN CLINIC AT THE ROYAL LIVERPOOL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, BASED ON THE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR MSP. THE PRE-TREATMENT SNOT-22 OF THESE PATIENTS WERE ALSO COMPARED TO PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS AND NORMAL HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS. RESULTS: TWENTY-NINE CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF MSP WERE IDENTIFIED, AND COMPARED WITH 30 CRS PATIENTS AND 34 HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS. THE AVERAGE SNOT-22 SCORES OF MSP AND CRS PATIENTS WERE HIGHER THAN NORMAL HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS. PATIENTS WITH CRS HAD THE HIGHEST RHINOLOGICAL SUBSCALE SNOT SCORES COMPARED TO NORMAL HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS AND MSP.

DESIGN: RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. SETTING: RHINOLOGY CLINICS FROM TWO HOSPITALS IN LIVERPOOL, UNITED KINGDOM. PARTICIPANTS: PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH NSP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PATIENTS (N = 26) DIAGNOSED WITH NSP COMPLETED THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22). THE COLLATED DATA WERE COMPARED WITH SNOT-22 SCORES FROM A COHORT OF HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS (N = 34) AND A COHORT OF PATIENTS (N = 30) DIAGNOSED WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS). RESULTS: THE MEAN TOTAL SNOT-22 SCORE OF NSP AND CRS COHORTS WAS HIGHER THAN THAT OBSERVED IN HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS. THE MEAN TOTAL SNOT-22 SCORE IN THE CRS COHORT (57.2, STANDARD DEVIATION SD 10.3) WAS THE HIGHER THAN NSP (50.2, SD 23.5), ALTHOUGH THIS DIFFERENCE DID NOT ACHIEVE STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. THE MEAN SCORE FOR THE RHINOLOGIC-SPECIFIC DOMAINS (RHINOLOGIC SYMPTOMS, EXTRANASAL RHINOLOGIC SYMPTOMS), EAR/FACIAL SYMPTOMS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DYSFUNCTION DOMAIN WAS HIGHER IN THE CRS COHORT COMPARED TO NSP, ALTHOUGH STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE WAS ONLY OBSERVED IN THE EXTRANASAL RHINOLOGIC SYMPTOMS DOMAIN (11.2, SD 2.4 VS 6.4, SD 4.1).

CRSWNP IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH ASTHMA AND IS DIFFICULT TO CONTROL AND MANAGE DESPITE PHARMACOLOGICAL AND/OR SURGICAL TREATMENT. OMALIZUMAB, A MONOCLONAL ANTI-IGE ANTIBODY, HAS EMERGED AS A PUTATIVE THERAPEUTIC OPTION. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF OMALIZUMAB ON NASAL POLYP (NP) SIZE AND QOL ASSESSED BY SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22) IN PATIENTS WITH RECALCITRANT CRSWNP AND MILD ASTHMA. METHODS: A MULTICENTER RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF PATIENT DATA FROM THE COMMUNITY OF VALENCIA (SPAIN) WAS PERFORMED. ADULT PATIENTS WITH RECALCITRANT CRSWNP AND COMORBID MILD ASTHMA RECEIVING COMPASSIONATE USE OF OMALIZUMAB WERE INCLUDED. NP SIZE MEASURED BY TOTAL NASAL ENDOSCOPIC POLYP SCORE (TPS) AND QOL EVALUATED THROUGH THE SNOT-22 QUESTIONNAIRE WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND MONTHLY OVER 12 MONTHS. AN ORDINAL REGRESSION MODEL WAS BUILT TO ANALYZE THE RESULTS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 23 CRSWNP PATIENTS WITH A MEAN AGE (± SD) OF 54.78 ± 9.46 YEARS WERE INCLUDED. NINETEEN SUFFERED FROM ASPIRIN-EXACERBATED RESPIRATORY DISEASE (AERD). IN ALL PATIENTS, A SIGNIFICANT AND SUSTAINED REDUCTION IN TPS WAS OBSERVED OVER TIME, ACCOMPANIED BY IMPROVEMENTS IN QOL REFLECTED IN LOWER SNOT-22 SCORES. IN THE ORDINAL REGRESSION MODEL, TIME BUT NOT TOTAL IGE, AGE OR TISSUE EOSINOPHILIA IMPACTED ON NP SIZE AND SNOT-22 OUTCOMES.

COLLOIDAL SILVER (CS), A WIDELY USED NATUROPATHIC AGENT, HAS RECENTLY SHOWN ANTI-BIOFILM PROPERTIES BOTH IN VITRO AND WITHIN A RHINOSINUSITIS ANIMAL MODEL. TO DATE, NO TRIALS INVOLVING HUMANS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN WORLD LITERATURE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF CS AS A TOPICAL NASAL SPRAY IN PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY CRSSP. METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED USING A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 20 RANDOMIZED PATIENTS WITH CROSSOVER METHODOLOGY, COMPARING NASAL SPRAYS WITH CS VERSUS SALINE. PATIENTS SPRAYED TWICE DAILY FOR SIX WEEKS WITH THE FIRST INTERVENTION AND THEN SWITCHED TO THE SECOND FOR THE NEXT SIX WEEKS, WITH MEASUREMENTS MADE AT BASELINE AND EACH TIME POINT. PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE CHANGES IN SNOT-22 AND LUND-KENNEDY (LK) ENDOSCOPIC SCORES. ALL ANALYSIS WAS NON-PARAMETRIC AND WAS CONDUCTED USING STATA 14. RESULTS: TWENTY-TWO PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED IN THE STUDY WITH 20 COMPLETING THE ENTIRE PROTOCOL. MEAN 6-WEEK CHANGE IN SNOT-22 SCORES WERE -2.8 AND 1.0 FOR SALINE AND CS, RESPECTIVELY (P = 0.373). SIMILARLY, MEAN 6-WEEK CHANGE IN LK SCORES WERE -1.4 AND -1.1 FOR SALINE AND CS, RESPECTIVELY (P = 0.794). SIGNIFICANT PERIOD EFFECTS WERE OBSERVED WITH THE SNOT-22 SCORE BETWEEN THE RANDOMIZED GROUPS. NO PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF INTRANASAL CS.

THIS STUDY SEEKS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER PATIENTS WITH CRS-WITH AND WITHOUT A MIGRAINE HISTORY-EXPERIENCE COMPARABLE QUALITY-OF-LIFE (QOL) IMPROVEMENT AFTER ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS). STUDY DESIGN: RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF A PROSPECTIVE COHORT. METHODS: AN ADULT POPULATION (N = 229) WITH MEDICALLY REFRACTORY CRS WAS PROSPECTIVELY EVALUATED FOLLOWING ESS USING DISEASE-SPECIFIC QOL SURVEYS: THE RHINOSINUSITIS DISABILITY INDEX (RSDI), THE CHRONIC SINUSITIS SURVEY (CSS), AND THE SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22). HISTORY OF COMORBID MIGRAINE WAS IDENTIFIED (N = 46), AND PREOPERATIVE AND POSTOPERATIVE QOL WAS COMPARED TO PATIENTS WITHOUT MIGRAINE (N = 183). RESULTS: PATIENTS MIGRAINE AND CRS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE FEMALE (P = 0.023); EXPERIENCE ALLERGIES (P = 0.024), FIBROMYALGIA (P = 0.009), AND DEPRESSION (P = 0.010); AND BE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE NASAL POLYPOSIS (P = 0.003).

THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE INTERRATER AGREEMENT OF VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF NASAL ENDOSCOPY FINDINGS IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING EVALUATION FOR CRS. METHODS: FOURTEEN PATIENTS (28 SIDES) WITH CRS UNDERWENT CLINICAL EVALUATION, SNOT-22, SINUS COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT), AND DIGITAL VIDEO NASAL ENDOSCOPY. FIVE ACADEMIC RHINOLOGISTS BLINDLY REVIEWED THE ENDOSCOPIES FOR STRUCTURAL ANATOMIC ISSUES, INFLAMMATORY RHINOSINUSITIS FINDINGS, AND ATYPICAL LESIONS. STATISTICAL COMPARISON OF THE ENDOSCOPY INTERPRETATIONS WAS PERFORMED USING THE UNWEIGHTED FLEISS' KAPPA STATISTIC (K(F) ).

METHODS: WE ENROLLED CRS PATIENTS 5 YEARS AFTER INITIAL ESS AT OUR INSTITUTION. PATIENTS UNDERWENT INITIAL ESS AT OUR INSTITUTION BETWEEN JANUARY 2013 AND JANUARY 2015. PATIENTS PROSPECTIVELY HAD THE FOLLOWING MEASUREMENTS AT BASELINE, 1 MONTH, 6 MONTHS, AND 5 YEARS POST-ESS: NNO LEVELS, LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPY SCORE (LKES), AND 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22) SCORE. WE ALSO COMPARED THE NNO LEVELS BETWEEN PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT REVISION ESS AND THOSE WHO DID NOT. RESULTS: THERE WERE 32 PATIENTS INCLUDED IN THE STUDY WITH 8 PATIENTS UNDERGOING REVISION ESS DURING THE 5-YEAR FOLLOW-UP. NNO LEVELS WERE ELEVATED AT 1 MONTH, 6 MONTHS, AND 5 YEARS POST-ESS COMPARED TO BASELINE. A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN NNO AND LKES WAS FOUND AT 5 YEARS POST-ESS. NNO LEVELS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED AT BASELINE AND 6 MONTHS POST-ESS IN THE REVISION COHORT COMPARED TO THE NONREVISION COHORT DESPITE HAVING COMPARABLE RADIOLOGIC SEVERITY. CONCLUSION: NNO MAY SERVE AS A NONINVASIVE LONG-TERM BIOMARKER TO MONITOR SINUS DISEASE SEVERITY AND TO PROGNOSTICATE RESULTS IN PATIENTS WITH CRS. THIS HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR POTENTIAL INTEGRATION INTO CLINICAL PRACTICE.","DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD & NECK SURGERY, ST.; MICHAEL'S HOSPITAL, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO, TORONTO, ON, CANADA.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD & NECK SURGERY, ST.; MICHAEL'S HOSPITAL, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO, TORONTO, ON, CANADA.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD & NECK SURGERY, ST.; MICHAEL'S HOSPITAL, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO, TORONTO, ON, CANADA.;","ORCID: 0000-0003-4057-2858 ORCID: 0000-0001-8473-4674","© 2020 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2020/04/13 06:00","20210929","20200607",2020,"2020/04/13 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"8",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.22581 [DOI]","20210929","2021/09/30 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","971-977","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"32279461","PPUBLISH","0 (BIOMARKERS) 31C4KY9ESH (NITRIC OXIDE)","IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2020 AUG;10(8):971-977.

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE SIMULTANEOUS ADMINISTRATION OF NASAL ACOUSTIC VIBRATION AND OSCILLATING EXPIRATORY PRESSURE FOR THE TREATMENT OF NASAL CONGESTION. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC NASAL CONGESTION BUT WITHOUT FIXED ANATOMIC OBSTRUCTION PARTICIPATED IN A PROSPECTIVE CLINICAL STUDY APPLYING SIMULTANEOUS ACOUSTIC VIBRATIONS AND POSITIVE EXPIRATORY PRESSURE TO THE NASAL CAVITY TWICE DAILY OVER 5 WEEKS. SAFETY WAS ASSESSED BY RHINOSCOPY AND PATIENT QUESTIONNAIRES. EFFICACY WAS ASSESSED USING PEAK NASAL INSPIRATORY FLOW (PNIF), VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) OF NASAL SYMPTOMS, TOTAL NASAL SYMPTOM SCORE (TNSS), NASAL OBSTRUCTION AND SEPTOPLASTY EFFECTIVENESS (NOSE) SCORE, AND THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). RESULTS: FORTY PATIENTS (MEAN AGE 39 YEARS, 65% FEMALE) COMPLETED THE STUDY WITH NO ADVERSE EFFECTS. AT THE 2 WEEK FOLLOW-UP, PNIF IMPROVED BY 25.0 L/MIN (31% INCREASE FROM BASELINE, P < 0.001). AT THE 5 WEEK FOLLOW-UP, NASAL CONGESTION VAS IMPROVED FROM MEAN ± SD OF 5.8 ± 2.4 TO 2.6 ± 2.3, TNSS IMPROVED FROM 7.2 ± 3.5 TO 3.5 ± 3.1, NOSE IMPROVED FROM 50.4 ± 19.9 TO 23.3 ± 17.2, AND SNOT-22 IMPROVED FROM 31.7 ± 20.3 TO 14.2 ± 12.7, ALL P < 0.001. EIGHTY PERCENT OF PATIENTS WOULD USE THE DEVICE AGAIN AND 87.5% WOULD RECOMMEND TO OTHERS. CONCLUSION: SIMULTANEOUS ADMINISTRATION OF ACOUSTIC VIBRATION AND OSCILLATING EXPIRATORY PRESSURE APPEARS TO BE A SAFE TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC NASAL CONGESTION. RESULTS FROM THIS INITIAL STUDY ARE PROMISING WITH REGARD TO EFFICACY BUT WILL REQUIRE FURTHER STUDY.","DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND SINUS SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND SINUS SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND SINUS SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND SINUS SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND SINUS SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND SINUS SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND SINUS SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.;",NA,"© 2020 THE AUTHORS.

IN THIS RETROSPECTIVE STUDY WE EVALUATED THE USEFULNESS OF CAN IN ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY AND STUDIED ITS ADVANTAGES OVER CONVENTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY. METHODS: WE RETROSPECTIVELY REVIEWED THE RECORDS OF 96 PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS). 48 PATIENTS UNDERGOING ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY WITH SURGICAL NAVIGATION (A GROUP) AND OTHER 48 WITHOUT NAVIGATION (B GROUP). DATA ABOUT PERCENTAGE OF COMPLICATIONS, OLFACTORY FUNCTION (VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE), SINO-NASAL OUTCOMES TEST (SNOT-22), RHINOSINUSITIS QUALITY OF LIFE (RHINOQOL), RECURRENCE (CT LUND-MACKAY SCORE), TOTAL NASAL RESISTANCE (RHINOMANOMETRY) AND DURATION OF THE INTERVENTION WERE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED. RESULTS: A GROUP EVIDENCED A DECREASE OF RECURRENCE RATE (P=0.009), A REDUCTION OF TOTAL NASAL RESISTANCE (P=0.007), OF FRONTAL RECESS STENOSIS (P=0.04) AND OF NASAL SYMPTOMATOLOGY (P=0.008). QOL HAD A BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN GROUP A. RATE OF OTHER COMPLICATIONS AND OLFACTORY FUNCTION DID NOT SHOW STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. THE AVERAGE CALIBRATION TIME WAS APPROXIMATELY 11MIN IN THE A GROUP. TOTAL TIME OF SURGICAL PROCEDURE DOES NOT EVIDENCED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS (P>0.05) BUT IF IT IS CONSIDERED ONLY THE TIME OF THE SURGICAL INTERVENTION, THE DIFFERENCE OF DURATION IS SIGNIFICANT REDUCED STATISTICALLY (P<0.05) IN CAN SURGERY. CONCLUSION: COMPUTER ASSISTED NAVIGATION IN ESS CAN BE USEFUL FOR THE MOST EXPERIENCED SURGEONS, ESPECIALLY IN THE FRONTAL RECESS SURGERY, DECREASING THE RECURRENCE RATE AND REDUCING THE TOTAL NASAL RESISTANCE.","DEPARTMENT OF ADULT AND DEVELOPMENT AGE HUMAN PATHOLOGY \"GAETANO BARRESI\", UNIT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF MESSINA, ITALY.; DEPARTMENT OF ADULT AND DEVELOPMENT AGE HUMAN PATHOLOGY \"GAETANO BARRESI\", UNIT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF MESSINA, ITALY.; DEPARTMENT OF ADULT AND DEVELOPMENT AGE HUMAN PATHOLOGY \"GAETANO BARRESI\", UNIT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF MESSINA, ITALY.; DEPARTMENT OF ADULT AND DEVELOPMENT AGE HUMAN PATHOLOGY \"GAETANO BARRESI\", UNIT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF MESSINA, ITALY; ENT SECTION, ARNAS FATEBENEFRATELLI HOSPITAL, PALERMO, ITALY.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: FEDERICOSIRECI@HOTMAIL.;IT.; DEPARTMENT OF ADULT AND DEVELOPMENT AGE HUMAN PATHOLOGY \"GAETANO BARRESI\", UNIT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF MESSINA, ITALY.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT © 2018 ELSEVIER B.V.

WE STUDIED OUTCOMES OF MEDICAL VS SURGICAL TREATMENT OF RARS, ANATOMIC VARIANTS ASSOCIATED WITH RARS, AND FACTORS PREDICTING CROSSOVER FROM MEDICAL TO SURGICAL TREATMENT. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 220 RARS PATIENTS TREATED BETWEEN 2006 AND 2014 WERE RETROSPECTIVELY DIVIDED INTO 3 COHORTS: MEDICAL ONLY (MED); SURGICAL ONLY (SURG); OR MEDICAL CROSSING OVER INTO SURGICAL (CROSS). TWENTY-TWO ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES, MODIFIED LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPY SCORES, AND PREVALENCE OF ANATOMIC VARIANTS BY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) WERE COMPARED. A TOTAL OF 220 CT SCANS OBTAINED FOR NON-SINUS INDICATIONS SERVED AS CONTROLS. A LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL WAS USED FOR ANALYSIS. RESULTS: THE MEAN BASELINE SNOT-22 SCORES FOR ALL COHORTS WERE SIMILAR (MED = 48, SURG = 49, CROSS = 45, P < 0.0001). THE SURG COHORT SHOWED GREATER REDUCTION OF SNOT-22 SCORES COMPARED TO THE MED COHORT AT 3, 6, AND 12 MONTHS FOLLOW-UP (P < 0.0001). THE CROSSOVER COHORT CONVERTED TO SURGERY AFTER ESCALATION OF SNOT-22 SCORE BY A MEAN OF 15 POINTS (P < 0.03), AND SHOWED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION POSTOPERATIVELY (P < 0.0001).

OUR PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVE WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF ESS WAIT TIMES ON POSTOPERATIVE SNOT-22 GLOBAL AND SYMPTOM DOMAIN SCORES IN PATIENTS WITH RCRS DEEMED \"APPROPRIATE\" SURGICAL CANDIDATES. METHODS: THIS WAS A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH RCRS UNDERGOING ESS, CATEGORIZED AS \"APPROPRIATE\" SURGICAL CANDIDATES. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS CHANGE IN SNOT-22 GLOBAL/SYMPTOM DOMAIN SCORE (PREOPERATIVE - 6-MONTH POSTOPERATIVE). CORRELATIONAL ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED BETWEEN WAIT TIME AND CHANGE IN SNOT-22 GLOBAL AND SYMPTOM DOMAIN SCORES. FOR SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CORRELATIONS, THE THRESHOLD WAIT TIME TO GENERATE A WORSENING IN HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY-OF-LIFE (HRQOL) EQUIVALENT TO THE MEAN CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE (MCID) WAS CALCULATED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 104 PATIENTS WITH A MEAN ± STANDARD DEVIATION (SD) WAIT TIME OF 310.8 ± 155.9 DAYS WERE ANALYZED. POSTOPERATIVE SNOT-22 GLOBAL AND SYMPTOM DOMAIN SCORES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED POSTOPERATIVELY. WAIT TIME FOR ESS WAS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH CHANGE IN SNOT-22 GLOBAL, RHINOLOGIC, EXTRANASAL RHINOLOGIC, AND EAR/FACIAL DOMAIN SCORES (P < 0.05), AND A WAIT TIME THRESHOLD OF 287, 452, 421, AND 381 DAYS CORRESPONDED TO A DECREASE EQUIVALENT TO THE MCID, RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSION: WE IDENTIFIED LESS IMPROVEMENT IN HRQOL AFTER ESS WITH INCREASING SURGICAL WAIT TIME.

THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) IS A FULLY VALIDATED AND EASY-TO-USE OUTCOME MEASURE IN RHINOLOGY. OUR GOAL WAS TO TRANSLATE AND VALIDATE THE SNOT-22 IN A COHORT OF 422 FRENCH-SPEAKING SUBJECTS. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: THE FRENCH VERSION OF THE SNOT-22 WAS OBTAINED BY FORWARD AND BACKWARD TRANSLATIONS BY SIX INDEPENDENT INTERPRETERS. FIVE EXPERIENCED RHINOLOGISTS COMPARED THE TRANSLATIONS TO EACH OTHER, AND A GROUP OF 12 NAIVE PATIENTS SELECTED THE MOST APPROPRIATE TRANSLATION OF EACH ITEM. TO EVALUATE THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, WE CONDUCTED A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY ON 376 RHINOLOGICAL PATIENTS AND 46 HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS IN THREE UNIVERSITY-AFFILIATED TEACHING HOSPITALS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: REPRODUCIBILITY (TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY), INTERNAL CONSISTENCY, KNOWN-GROUP DIFFERENCES, RESPONSIVENESS TO TREATMENT, VALIDITY AND CORRELATION TO OTHER CLINICAL INSTRUMENTS (VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE, NASAL OBSTRUCTION SYMPTOMS EVALUATION SCORE AND LUND-MACKAY SCORE). RESULTS: THE TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY COEFFICIENT WAS 0.78, INDICATING A GOOD RELIABILITY WHEN ADMINISTERING THE INSTRUMENT ON TWO DIFFERENT OCCASIONS. THE INTERNAL CONSISTENCY WAS HIGH WITH A CRONBACH'S <U+0391> VALUE OF 0.93. OUR QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ABLE TO DETECT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RHINOLOGICAL PATIENTS AND CONTROL SUBJECTS (P < 0.0001) AND IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER NOSE AND SINUS SURGERY (P < 0.0001), INDICATING A GOOD RESPONSIVENESS. THERE WAS A RELATIVE CORRELATION WITH VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE AND NASAL OBSTRUCTION SYMPTOMS EVALUATION (NOSE) SCORE, BUT NO CORRELATION WITH LUND-MACKAY SCORE.

THE INTERACTION BETWEEN DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND SEVERITY OF CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS) HAS BEEN SUGGESTED. WE AIMED TO ACCESS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS, SEVERITY OF CRS, AND ATOPY. SIXTY-THREE CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS REFERRED WITH CRS WERE ASKED TO SCORE THE SEVERITY OF RHINOSINUSITIS SYMPTOMS ON A VISUAL ANALOG SCALE AND TO FILL IN QUESTIONNAIRES ON THE DISEASE-SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE AND PERCEIVED STRESS-22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AND MEASURE OF PERCEIVED STRESS (MPS) SCALE, RESPECTIVELY.

THE BENEFICIAL IMPACT OF SURGERY ON CRS IS WELL KNOWN. HOWEVER, PATIENTS OFTEN NOTE THAT THEIR SLEEP IS IMPROVED AFTER FESS EVEN WITHOUT SIMULTANEOUS CORRECTION OF NASAL OBSTRUCTION. SLEEP OUTCOMES AFTER FESS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERSTUDIED. HENCE IN THE CURRENT STUDY WE LOOK TO CHARACTERIZE PATIENT SLEEP QUALITY FOLLOWING SINUS SURGERY. METHODS: DATA WAS GATHERED FROM 2 SITES (WESTERN UNIVERSITY [CANADA] AND THE ASIA SLEEP CENTER [SINGAPORE]). PATIENTS MEETING DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR CRS WITHOUT NASAL POLYPOSIS (CRSSNP) WERE INCLUDED. CASES WITH POLYPOSIS AND THOSE WHO NEEDED A SEPTOPLASTY WERE EXCLUDED SO AS TO PURELY ANALYZE THE IMPACT OF THE SINUS SURGERY ON SLEEP. SLEEP OUTCOMES RECORDED AT BASELINE JUST PRIOR TO SURGERY AND 6 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY WERE THE EPWORTH SLEEPINESS SCALE (EPSS) AND THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI). WE ALSO RECORDED 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES AND NASAL OBSTRUCTION SYMPTOM EVALUATION (NOSE) SCORES. COMPARISONS WERE MADE WITH PAIRED T TESTS. RESULTS: FIFTY-THREE PATIENTS MET INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA. SLEEP OUTCOMES SHOWED A CLINICALLY AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT (EPSS BEFORE FESS = 14.7 ± 3.1, EPSS AFTER FESS = 9.1 ± 1.1, P < 0.01; PSQI BEFORE FESS = 10.9 ± 2.8, PSQI AFTER FESS = 5.3 ± 2.2, P < 0.01). CRS-SPECIFIC OUTCOMES WERE IMPROVED AS WELL. NASAL OBSTRUCTION SCORES DID NOT CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY. CONCLUSION: FESS IMPROVED SLEEP OUTCOMES FOR THE PATIENTS IN OUR STUDY.

METHODS: ADULT PATIENTS WITH MEDICALLY REFRACTORY CRS (N = 241) WERE PROSPECTIVELY ENROLLED INTO A MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL TREATMENT OUTCOMES INVESTIGATION.

RESULTS: THE PREVALENCE OF COMORBID OBESITY WAS 41% (N = 99). HIGHER PREVALENCE OF COMORBID DISEASE WAS FOUND ACROSS INCREASING BMI GROUPS INCLUDING DIABETES MELLITUS, ASTHMA, AND DEPRESSION. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND IN MEAN PREOPERATIVE QOL MEASURES BETWEEN ANY BMI GROUPS. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT BETWEEN PREOPERATIVE AND POSTOPERATIVE QOL MEAN SCORES (P = 0.050) WAS FOUND FOR ALL BMI GROUPS.

PRETREATMENT AND POSTTREATMENT NASAL SYMPTOMS SCORES (NSS), QUALITY OF LIFE (22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOMES TEST [SNOT-22]), AND CT (LUND-MACKAY [LM]) SCORES WERE RECORDED ALONG WITH POST-MMT ENDOSCOPY STATUS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 86 PATIENTS (38% FEMALE, AGE 46 ± 13 YEARS) MET INCLUSION CRITERIA. PRE-MMT AND POST-MMT LM SCORES WERE 10.9 ± 5.3 AND 8.3 ± 5.5 (CHANGE 2.6 ± 3.8, P < 0.001). MEDIAN FOLLOW-UP AFTER THEIR INITIAL POST-MMT ASSESSMENT WAS 6.3 (INTERQUARTILE RANGE [IQR] 17) MONTHS. AT INITIAL POST-MMT REVIEW, 43 (50%) WERE SYMPTOMATIC WITH PERSISTENT RADIOLOGIC DISEASE (\"SYMPTOMATIC CRS\"), 12 (14%) WERE ASYMPTOMATIC WITH NO RADIOLOGIC DISEASE (\"RESOLVED CRS\"), 21 (24%) WERE ASYMPTOMATIC WITH PERSISTENT RADIOLOGIC DISEASE (\"ASYMPTOMATIC CRS\"), AND 10 (12%) WERE SYMPTOMATIC WITH NO RADIOLOGIC DISEASE (\"ALTERNATE DIAGNOSIS\"). PRE-MMT NSS AND SNOT-22 WERE SIMILAR AMONG GROUPS. THE \"ASYMPTOMATIC CRS\" GROUP HAD THE HIGHEST AGE (52 ± 11 YEARS, P = 0.07). THE \"ALTERNATE DIAGNOSIS\" GROUP HAD THE LOWEST INITIAL LM SCORES (5.2 ± 2.9, P = 0.001). OF THE \"ASYMPTOMATIC CRS\" PATIENTS, 43% RELAPSED BETWEEN 3 AND 23 MONTHS (MEDIAN 6; IQR 4.4 MONTHS) POST-MMT AND 29% EVENTUALLY UNDERWENT SURGERY. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH MMT FOR CRS ACHIEVED SYMPTOMATIC RELIEF IN 38% PATIENTS, OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF DISEASE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH CLINICAL RELAPSE. THE CONCEPTS OF \"RESPONSE\" TO MEDICAL THERAPY AND THE NEED TO \"CONTROL\" LONG-TERM INFLAMMATORY BURDEN NEED TO BE BALANCED.","DEPT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, WELLINGTON HOSPITAL, WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND; APPLIED MEDICAL RESEARCH CENTRE, ST.; VINCENT'S HOSPITAL, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.;",NA,"© 2014 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2014/03/11 06:00","20150416","20140307",2014,"2014/03/13 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"7",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.21315 [DOI]","20160511","2015/04/17 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","525-32","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"24610673","PPUBLISH","VB0R961HZT (PREDNISONE)","IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2014 JUL;4(7):525-32.

THIS STUDY AIMS TO COMPARE METHODS OF ASSESSING HEALTH UTILITY IN CRS. METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL SAMPLE OF CRS PATIENTS (N = 137) WERE INTERVIEWED USING DIRECT HEALTH UTILITY ASSESSMENT MEASURES: THE VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS), TIME TRADE-OFF (TTO), AND STANDARD GAMBLE (SG). GENERAL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) SCORES WERE OBTAINED VIA THE 36-ITEM SHORT FORM HEALTH SURVEY (SF-36) AND CONVERTED TO SF-6D HEALTH UTILITY VALUES USING A BAYESIAN ALGORITHM. DISEASE-SPECIFIC QOL WAS MEASURED WITH THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). A SELECTED SUBGROUP OF PATIENTS (N = 51) NOT INITIATING SURGERY OR NEW TREATMENT FOR CRS WERE RE-INTERVIEWED WITHIN 3 WEEKS. RESULTS: THE MEAN ± SD HEALTH UTILITIES WERE VAS 0.69 ± 0.19; TTO 0.80 ± 0.27; SG 0.93 ± 0.11; AND SF-6D 0.72 ± 0.12; THEY DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.001). ONLY VAS SCORES DIFFERED BASED ON DISEASE STATE CLASSIFICATION OR THE PRESENCE OF NASAL POLYPOSIS. CORRELATIONS BETWEEN METHODS OF DETERMINING HEALTH UTILITY WERE WEAK, BUT SIGNIFICANT. VAS, TTO, AND SF-6D SCORES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH SNOT-22 (P < 0.001 FOR ALL); HOWEVER, SG AND SNOT-22 WERE POORLY CORRELATED (SPEARMAN CORRELATION = -0.33). THE TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY OF TTO (SPEARMAN CORRELATION = 0.71) AND SG (0.73) WAS STRONG. CONCLUSION: CRS PATIENTS SHOW SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT IN QOL, WITH HEALTH UTILITY VALUES SIMILAR TO THOSE OF PATIENTS WITH ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS) OR INTERMITTENT CLAUDICATION USING SIMILAR METHODS. THE METHOD OF ASCERTAINMENT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS MEASURED HEALTH UTILITY, BUT THE DEGREE OF IMPAIRMENT WARRANTS IMPROVED RECOGNITION AND APPROPRIATE TREATMENT OF THE CONDITION.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FEINBERG SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, CHICAGO, IL.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, HOSPITAL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, PHILADELPHIA, PA.; SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY, UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, ROCHESTER, NY.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, VANDERBILT BILL WILKERSON CENTER, NASHVILLE, TN.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FEINBERG SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, CHICAGO, IL.; DIVISION OF ALLERGY-IMMUNOLOGY, DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FEINBERG SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, CHICAGO, IL.; CENTER FOR HEALTH RESEARCH, GEISINGER HEALTH SYSTEM, DANVILLE, PA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FEINBERG SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, CHICAGO, IL.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FEINBERG SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, CHICAGO, IL.; CENTER FOR HEALTHCARE STUDIES, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FEINBERG SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, CHICAGO, IL.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FEINBERG SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, CHICAGO, IL.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FEINBERG SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, CHICAGO, IL.;",NA,"© 2015 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2015/06/17 06:00","20160815","20150616",2015,"2015/06/17 06:00",NA,NA,"K23 DC012067/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/UNITED STATES P01 AI106683/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/UNITED STATES U19 AI106683/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/UNITED STATES K23DC012067/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/UNITED STATES","10",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (PRINT) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.21556 [DOI]","20191210","2016/08/16 06:00","NIHMS685342",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","929-36",NA,"PMC4607564",NA,"26077390","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2015 OCT;5(10):929-36.

THE PROCEDURE IS LONGER IN DURATION AND DRAWS ON MORE RESOURCES THAN ENDONASAL SEPTOPLASTY. THE OUTCOME REPORTING OF THE EXTERNAL APPROACH FOR SEPTOPLASTY IS IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF BENEFIT FOR BOTH PATIENTS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO DESCRIBE FUNCTIONAL AND COSMETIC OUTCOMES OF THE EXTERNAL APPROACH FOR SEPTOPLASTY. METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE ASSESSMENT OF CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS UNDERGOING THE EXTERNAL APPROACH FOR SEPTOPLASTY AT A TERTIARY CENTER WAS PERFORMED. PRE- AND POSTOPERATIVE NASAL PEAK INSPIRATORY FLOW (NPIF), SYMPTOM SCORES, 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), NASAL OBSTRUCTION SCORE, AND SHORT FORM 36 (SF-36) QUALITY-OF-LIFE SCORES WERE ASSESSED.

METHODS: A CASE-CONTROL STUDY OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH CRS UNDERGOING ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS) WAS PERFORMED. MUCOSAL REMODELING WAS DEFINED BY SQUAMOUS METAPLASIA, SUBEPITHELIAL FIBROSIS, AND/OR BASEMENT MEMBRANE THICKENING.

THE PRESENT STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF ESS ON THE SACCHARIN TIME (MUCOCILIARY CLEARANCE TIME) IN RELATION TO SYMPTOM PROFILE ASSESSED BY THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT)-22, AND DISEASE SEVERITY BASED ON THE LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPIC SCORES AND LUND-MACKAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHIC (CT) SCORES. METHOD: THE PRESENT COHORT STUDY INCLUDED 22 PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WHO WERE CONSIDERED A CANDIDATE FOR ESS DUE TO LACK OF RESPONSE TO MEDICAL TREATMENT. SACCHARIN TEST WAS USED BEFORE AND 3 MONTHS AFTER ESS TO EVALUATE CHANGES IN MUCOCILIARY FUNCTION. THE CT SCAN WAS USED FOR PREOPERATIVE ASSESSMENT OF SINONASAL ANATOMY. IN ADDITION, DIAGNOSTIC NASAL ENDOSCOPY WAS PERFORMED BEFORE AND 3 MONTHS AFTER ESS. THE CT SCAN AND NASAL ENDOSCOPY FINDINGS WERE RESPECTIVELY ANALYZED BASED ON THE LUND-MACKAY AND THE LUND-KENNEDY STAGING SYSTEMS RECOMMENDED FOR CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS. SYMPTOM SEVERITY WAS ASSESSED FROM BEFORE TO 3 MONTHS AFTER ESS USING SNOT-22. RESULTS: THE PRESENT STUDY SHOWED DECREASED SACCHARIN TIME IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS THREE MONTHS AFTER ESS. THE MEAN PRE-OPERATIVE AND POST-OPERATIVE SACCHARIN TIME WERE 23.4 AND 16.9 MIN, RESPECTIVELY. THERE WAS ALSO A TREND TOWARD SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN THE SNOT-22 SCORES ON CHANGES IN SACCHARIN TIME. BY CONTRAST, NO EFFECTS OF AGE, GENDER, PRE-OPERATIVE LUND-MACKAY CT SCORES, AND CHANGES IN LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPY SCORES WERE OBSERVED ON POST-ESS SACCHARIN TIME.

PERCEPTION OF QOL CAN CHANGE ACCORDING TO ONE'S CURRENT MEDICAL OR EMOTIONAL STATE. THIS IS KNOWN AS RESPONSE SHIFT. IT CAN BE MEASURED BY THE \"THEN-TEST,\" WHICH ASKS PATIENTS TO REPORT PRETREATMENT SYMPTOMS AFTER RECEIVING TREATMENT. PATIENTS OFTEN DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR DISEASE BURDEN UNTIL THEIR SYMPTOMS ARE IMPROVED. THIS STUDY AIMS TO ASSESS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF RESPONSE SHIFT IN FESS OUTCOMES. METHODS: THIS WAS A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY THAT INCLUDED CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS PATIENTS FROM 2010 TO 2012 WHO COMPLETED A PREOPERATIVE 20-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-20). TWO SNOT-20 FORMS WERE MAILED APPROXIMATELY 6 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY. PATIENTS COMPLETED 1 SNOT-20 ACCORDING TO THEIR PREOPERATIVE SYMPTOMS IN LIGHT OF THEIR CURRENT STATE OF HEALTH (\"THEN-TEST\") AND THE OTHER BASED ON POSTOPERATIVE SYMPTOMS. THE PREOPERATIVE AND POSTOPERATIVE SNOT-20 DIFFERENCE REPRESENTED THE TREATMENT EFFECT AND THE PREOPERATIVE SNOT-20 AND THEN-TEST DIFFERENCE REPRESENTED THE RESPONSE SHIFT. RESULTS: THIRTY-TWO COMPLETED RESPONSES WERE OBTAINED. USING A 0 TO 5 SCALE, MEAN TREATMENT EFFECT WAS -0.96 (P < 0.01), WHICH SIGNIFIES A QOL IMPROVEMENT. MEAN RESPONSE SHIFT WAS +0.42 (P = 0.01). THIS POSITIVE VALUE SIGNIFIES THAT PATIENTS FELT THEY WERE WORSE OFF PREOPERATIVELY, LIKELY DUE TO A POSITIVE CHANGE IN HEALTH STATUS. THE ACTUAL TREATMENT EFFECT IS THE SUM OF THE MEASURED TREATMENT EFFECT AND RESPONSE SHIFT, WHICH WAS -1.38. CONCLUSION: RESPONSE SHIFT EXISTS AND CAN BE QUANTIFIED. THE ACTUAL TREATMENT EFFECT WAS MORE PROFOUND WHEN RESPONSE SHIFT WAS INCLUDED. THEREFORE, FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD ACCOUNT FOR THIS OFTEN UNMEASURED, POTENTIAL CHANGE IN QOL.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON, SEATTLE, WA.;",NA,"© 2014 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2014/10/04 06:00","20151021","20141002",2015,"2014/10/04 06:00",NA,NA,"KL2 RR025015/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/UNITED STATES L30 GM082982/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/UNITED STATES T32 DC000018/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/UNITED STATES T32 DC000018-27/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/UNITED STATES","1",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (PRINT) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.21420 [DOI]","20211021","2015/10/22 06:00","NIHMS623869",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","55-9",NA,"PMC4285584",NA,"25278286","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2015 JAN;5(1):55-9.

WE SOUGHT TO CHARACTERIZE UTILIZATION OF THESE SYSTEMIC MEDICATIONS AFTER APPROPRIATE MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS). STUDY DESIGN: PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL STUDY. METHODS: ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PATIENTS UNDERGOING MEDICAL MANAGEMENT FOR CRS WERE STUDIED. DATA WERE COLLECTED AT ENROLLMENT AND FOLLOW-UP 3 TO 12 MONTHS LATER. ALL PATIENTS WERE ASKED TO REPORT THE NUMBER OF CRS-RELATED ANTIBIOTICS AND ORAL CORTICOSTEROIDS USED IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS. CRS SYMPTOM BURDEN WAS MEASURED USING THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). ASSOCIATIONS WERE SOUGHT BETWEEN CRS-RELATED ANTIBIOTICS AND ORAL CORTICOSTEROIDS USE AT FOLLOW-UP COMPARED TO ENROLLMENT. RESULTS: FROM ENROLLMENT TO FOLLOW-UP, THE MEAN NUMBER OF CRS-RELATED ANTIBIOTICS COURSES USED DECREASED BY 0.2 COURSES (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI]: 0.1-0.4, P = .012), AND THE MEAN NUMBER OF CRS-RELATED ORAL CORTICOSTEROID COURSES USED ALSO DECREASED BY 0.2 COURSES (95% CI: 0.1-0.3, P = .029).

THE NUMBER OF CRS-RELATED ORAL CORTICOSTEROIDS USED AT FOLLOW-UP WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REPORTED CRS-RELATED ORAL CORTICOSTEROID USE AT ENROLLMENT (ADJUSTED RR = 3.20, 95% CI: 1.69-6.07, P < .001). SNOT-22 RESULTS AT ENROLLMENT WERE ALSO NOT PREDICTIVE OF FUTURE SYSTEMIC MEDICATION USE.

PREVIOUS STUDY HAS IDENTIFIED VARIOUS MEASURES OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AS PREDICTORS OF QUALITY-OF-LIFE OUTCOMES FOLLOWING ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS). PSYCHOLOGICAL DYSFUNCTION SCORES, AS MEASURED BY THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), HAVE BEEN FOUND TO INFLUENCE TREATMENT DECISION MAKING IN CRS. THIS STUDY AIMS TO FURTHER ELUCIDATE IMPROVEMENT IN DISCRETE PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS FOLLOWING ESS FOR CRS. METHODS: ADULT PATIENTS WITH MEDICALLY RECALCITRANT CRS ELECTING TO UNDERGO ESS WERE PROSPECTIVELY ENROLLED INTO A MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL, OBSERVATIONAL COHORT. PSYCHOLOGICAL-RELATED SYMPTOM SEVERITY AND POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED USING PSYCHOLOGICAL DOMAIN ITEMS OF THE SNOT-22, INCLUDING SUBGROUP ANALYSIS OF PATIENTS WITH AND WITHOUT COMORBID DEPRESSION. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 374 PARTICIPANTS MET INCLUSION CRITERIA AND WERE FOLLOWED POSTOPERATIVELY FOR A MEAN ± STANDARD DEVIATION (SD) OF 14.6 ± 5.0 MONTHS. TOTAL MEAN PSYCHOLOGICAL DOMAIN SCORES IMPROVED FROM 15.9 ± 8.2 TO 8.5 ± 8.4 (P < 0.001).

OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS META-ANALYSIS WAS TO EVALUATE THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF BCD IN PCRS. METHODS: ARTICLES REPORTING BCD FOR PCRS IN PATIENTS UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE WERE IDENTIFIED VIA THE FOLLOWING SEARCH TERMS: SINUSITIS OR RHINOSINUSITIS AND BALLOON DILATATION OR BALLOON DILATION OR BALLOON SINUPLASTY OR SINUPLASTY AND ADOLESCENT OR CHILDREN OR INFANT OR PEDIATRIC OR TODDLER. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME ANALYZED INCLUDES QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENT AS MEASURED VIA SINUS AND NASAL QUALITY OF LIFE SURVEY (SN-5) OR SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES. RESULTS: EIGHTY STUDIES WERE ABSTRACTED; 10 STUDIES WERE INCLUDED FOR FINAL QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS AFTER DUAL INVESTIGATOR SCREENING. THREE STUDIES DESCRIBED BCD WITH SURGICAL CONTROLS, INCLUDING ADENOIDECTOMY, SALINE IRRIGATION, OR MAXILLARY ANTROSTOMY. NONINFERIORITY WAS NOT DEMONSTRATED (IE, BCD IS INFERIOR) IN 2 OF 3 STUDIES. POOLED ANALYSIS UTILIZING A RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL REVEALED A DECREASED EFFECT SIZE YET NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BCD AND STANDARD OPERATIVE TECHNIQUES AS MEASURED BY QUALITY OF LIFE MEASURES (G = -0.04, I(2) = 41%). CONCLUSION: THIS WORK HIGHLIGHTS A LACK OF PUBLISHED EVIDENCE REGARDING THE ROLE OF BCD IN PCRS.

THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN MEAN SNOT-22 FROM 34.8 (29.4-40, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL) TO 24.4 (19.9-29.0) (P = 0.000003) AND IN THE RESPIRATORY DOMAIN OF THE CFQR FROM 60.6 (57.1-64.1) TO 83.3 (79.4-87.2) (P = 0.0000002), BOTH ACHIEVING A MINIMAL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE. PATIENTS PREVIOUSLY TAKING CFTR MODULATORS EXPERIENCED A GREATER BENEFIT IN SINONASAL AND RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS. CONCLUSIONS: ELEXACAFTOR-TEZACAFTOR-IVACAFTOR IS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SINONASAL SYMPTOMS; PREVIOUS USE OF CFTR MODULATORS IS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER BENEFIT.","COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IRVING MEDICAL CENTER DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, PULMONARY, ALLERGY AND CRITICAL CARE, 622 WEST 168TH STREET, NEW YORK, NEW YORK 10032, UNITED STATES.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: EAD3@CUMC.;COLUMBIA.;EDU.; COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IRVING MEDICAL CENTER, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, UNITED STATES.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: JO2566@CUMC.;COLUMBIA.;EDU.; COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IRVING MEDICAL CENTER DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, PULMONARY, ALLERGY AND CRITICAL CARE, 622 WEST 168TH STREET, NEW YORK, NEW YORK 10032, UNITED STATES.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: CK2132@CUMC.;COLUMBIA.;EDU.; COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IRVING MEDICAL CENTER DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, PULMONARY, ALLERGY AND CRITICAL CARE, 622 WEST 168TH STREET, NEW YORK, NEW YORK 10032, UNITED STATES.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: SMF2218@CUMC.;COLUMBIA.;EDU.; COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IRVING MEDICAL CENTER DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, PULMONARY, ALLERGY AND CRITICAL CARE, 622 WEST 168TH STREET, NEW YORK, NEW YORK 10032, UNITED STATES.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: DANSKY.;DAVID1@GMAIL.;COM.; COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IRVING MEDICAL CENTER, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, UNITED STATES.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: DAG62@CUMC.;COLUMBIA.;EDU.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT © 2020.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE OUTCOMES BETWEEN DRAF 2B AND DRAF 3 PROCEDURES. METHODS: A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED COMPARING PATIENTS UNDERGOING BILATERAL DRAF 2B VS DRAF 3 PROCEDURES FROM 2000 TO 2016. PATIENTS WITH NEOPLASIA, DYSPLASIA, MUCOCELE, CYSTIC FIBROSIS, OR CILIARY DYSKINESIA WERE EXCLUDED. PREOPERATIVE DISEASE PARAMETERS INCLUDED NUMBER OF PRIOR SURGERIES, PRESENCE OF POLYPS, PREOPERATIVE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORE, FRONTAL LUND-MACKAY SCORE, ANTERIOR-POSTERIOR DIAMETER OF THE FRONTAL OSTIUM, AND GLOBAL OSTEITIS SCORING SCALE (GOSS). POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES INCLUDED SNOT-22 SCORE, NEO-OSTIUM PATENCY, SURGICAL REVISION RATES, AND COMPLICATIONS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 21 PATIENTS WITH BILATERAL DRAF 2B AND 17 PATIENTS WITH DRAF 3 SURGERIES WERE COMPARED. MEAN FOLLOW-UP TIME WAS 15.6 MONTHS. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE SEEN BETWEEN GROUPS FOR ANY PREOPERATIVE DISEASE PARAMETER. BOTH COHORTS SHOWED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P = 0.0001 [DRAF 2B]; P = 0.0001 [DRAF 3]) AND CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL (<U+0394> = 24.1; <U+0394> = 24.9) IMPROVEMENTS IN SNOT-22 AT LAST FOLLOW-UP VS PREOPERATIVELY. THE DRAF 2B GROUP HAD GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN SNOT-22 SCORE THAN THE DRAF 3 GROUP AT 1 TO 3 MONTHS (P = 0.003), BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF IMPROVEMENT EQUALIZED AT 5 TO 9 MONTHS (P = 0.66) AND LAST FOLLOW-UP (P = 0.90). NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE NOTED BETWEEN GROUPS REGARDING PATENCY, REVISION RATES, OR COMPLICATIONS. CONCLUSION: BOTH DRAF 2B AND DRAF 3 PROCEDURES OFFER DURABLE SYMPTOMATIC IMPROVEMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY FRONTAL CRS.

METHOD: WE DEVELOPED A MARKOV MODEL TO SIMULATE COSTS AND QUALITY-ADJUSTED LIFE YEARS AMONG A COHORT OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITH POLYPS WHO RECEIVED ENDOSCOPIC POLYPECTOMY IN CLINIC OR ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY, OVER A PATIENT'S LIFETIME. OUR STUDY FOCUSED ON PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITH POLYPS WHO HAVE THE PREDOMINANT SYMPTOM OF BILATERAL NASAL OBSTRUCTION. COST DATA WERE OBTAINED FROM CANADIAN SOURCES. HEALTH UTILITY VALUES WERE DERIVED FROM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES REPORTED IN THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE. A CYCLE LENGTH OF SIX MONTHS WAS USED. BOTH COSTS AND QUALITY-ADJUSTED LIFE YEARS WERE DISCOUNTED USING AN ANNUAL RATE OF 1.5%. WE CONDUCTED ONE-WAY AND PROBABILISTIC SENSITIVITY ANALYSES TO ASSESS THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE STUDY FINDINGS. RESULTS: ENDOSCOPIC POLYPECTOMY IN CLINIC WAS A COST-SAVING OPTION AS IT HAD A LOWER COST (C$736 VS. C$6,728) AND PRODUCED MORE QUALITY-ADJUSTED LIFE YEARS (13.85 VS 13.06) COMPARED TO ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY. OUR FINDINGS WERE, HOWEVER, HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO HEALTH UTILITY VALUES. RESULTS FROM PROBABILISTIC SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT ENDOSCOPIC POLYPECTOMY IN CLINIC HAD A LOWER COST AND WAS MORE EFFECTIVE COMPARED TO ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY IN 99.86% OF ITERATIONS. CONCLUSION: FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE PUBLICLY FUNDED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, ENDOSCOPIC POLYPECTOMY IN CLINIC WAS ECONOMICALLY ATTRACTIVE COMPARED TO ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY FOR CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITH POLYPS PATIENTS WHO HAVE A PRIMARY SYMPTOM OF BILATERAL NASAL OBSTRUCTION.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO CORRELATE THE KENNEDY OSTEITIS SCORE (KOS) TO CLINICO-HISTOLOGIC FEATURES OF CRS. METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY OF CRS PATIENTS UNDERGOING SINUS SURGERY WAS CONDUCTED. OSTEITIS WAS SCORED RADIOLOGICALLY USING THE KOS. ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN OSTEITIS AND HISTOPATHOLOGY, SYMPTOMS, 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOMES TEST (SNOT-22), ENDOSCOPY, COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) MUCOSAL SCORE, AND SEROMARKERS WERE ASSESSED. INTEROBSERVER CORRELATION COEFFICIENT WAS PERFORMED. ADDITIONALLY, THE KOS WAS CORRELATED TO AN ALTERNATE GLOBAL OSTEITIS SCORE. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 88 PATIENTS WERE ASSESSED (45.5% FEMALE, AGE 50.3 ± 13.6 YEARS); 45 (51.1%) PATIENTS HAD OSTEITIS.

CONCLUSION: THE KOS IS A SIMPLE, EASY, AND REPRODUCIBLE SCALE IN ASSESSING OSTEITIC BONES IN PATIENTS WITH CRS AND CAN PREDICT MEASURES OF SEVERITY IN EOSINOPHILIC RHINOSINUSITIS.","AUSTRALIAN SCHOOL OF ADVANCED MEDICINE, MACQUARIE UNIVERSITY, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.; DRKORNKIAT@YAHOO.;COM",NA,"© 2013 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2012/11/09 06:00","20131231","20121107",2013,"2012/11/09 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"5",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.21113 [DOI]","20161125","2014/01/01 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","369-75","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"23136070","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2013 MAY;3(5):369-75.

POOR CORRELATION BETWEEN MICROBIOLOGIC CULTURE RESULTS AND THE SINUS MICROBIOME IN CRS HAS CAUSED INCREASED DEBATE AS TO THE RELEVANCE OF CULTURE-DIRECTED ANTIBIOTICS. THERE IS CURRENTLY SPARSE DATA COMPARING OUTCOMES OF CULTURE-DIRECTED ANTIBIOTICS VS NON-CULTURE-DIRECTED ANTIBIOTICS FOR TREATMENT OF CRS. METHODS: THIS WORK REPORTS A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW. A TOTAL OF 946 CRS PATIENTS TREATED WITH ANTIBIOTICS WERE EXAMINED; 122 CRS PATIENTS WITH ACUTE EXACERBATIONS WERE TREATED WITH CULTURE-DIRECTED (N = 61) VS EMPIRIC (N = 61) ANTIBIOTICS. LUND-KENNEDY (LK) AND 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES WERE COMPARED PRETREATMENT AND POSTTREATMENT, WITH SHORT-TERM (<1 MONTH) AND LONG-TERM (1-6 MONTHS) FOLLOW-UP. PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS, COMORBIDITIES, AND PRIOR SURGICAL HISTORY WERE COLLECTED. RESULTS: BOTH GROUPS HAD SIMILAR PRETREATMENT SNOT-22 SCORES (P = 0.25) WHILE THE CULTURE GROUP HAD HIGHER BASELINE LK ENDOSCOPY SCORES (P < 0.01). ALL DATA WERE ADJUSTED FOR PERTINENT COMORBIDITIES, SURGICAL HISTORY, CO-THERAPEUTICS, AND BASELINE SCORES. THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN IMPROVEMENT IN CULTURE-DIRECTED AND EMPIRICALLY TREATED GROUPS IN THE SHORT-TERM (P = 0.77) AND LONG-TERM (P = 0.58) FOR MINIMAL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE (MCID) OF SNOT-22 AND NO DIFFERENCE IN THE SHORT-TERM FOR LK SCORES (P = 0.11), BUT THERE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPROVEMENT IN LONG-TERM LK SCORES IN THE CULTURE-DIRECTED GROUP (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: CULTURE-DIRECTED THERAPY IMPROVES LONG-TERM ENDOSCOPY SCORES BUT DOES NOT YIELD AN ADVANTAGE IN IMPROVING SHORT-TERM ENDOSCOPY SCORES, NOR IN IMPROVING SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES IN CRS PATIENTS.

MEPOLIZUMAB IS AN ANTI-IL-5 MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY, APPROVED FOR THE TREATMENT OF SEVERE EOSINOPHILIC ASTHMA. A LIMITED NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE ASSESSED THE EFFICACY OF MEPOLIZUMAB ON CRSWNP IN SEVERE ASTHMATICS. WE AIM TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF MEPOLIZUMAB ON SINO-NASAL SYMPTOMS, POLYP GROWTH AND ASTHMA CONTROL IN SEVERE EOSINOPHILIC ASTHMA PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP IN REAL LIFE. METHODS: IN THIS STUDY 44 SEVERE EOSINOPHILIC ASTHMA PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP WERE TREATED WITH MEPOLIZUMAB (100 MG Q4W) FOR 1 YEAR. THE FOLLOWING OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED BEFORE (T0), AFTER 6 (T6) AND 12 MONTHS (T12) OF TREATMENT: SINO/NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), TOTAL ENDOSCOPIC NASAL POLYP SCORE (TENPS), %FEV1 (FEV1/FEV1 PREDICTED) AND ASTHMA CONTROL TEST (ACT). BLOOD EOSINOPHIL COUNT, EXHALED NITRIC OXIDE (FENO) AND PREDNISONE INTAKE WERE MEASURED. IN A SUBGROUP OF PATIENTS, NASAL CYTOLOGY WAS PERFORMED BEFORE (T0), AFTER 6 (T6) AND AFTER 12 MONTHS (T12) OF TREATMENT WITH MEPOLIZUMAB. RESULTS: WE REPORTED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF SNOT-22 [FROM 51.5 ± 21.2 AT BASELINE (T0) TO 31.70 ± 17.36 AT T6 AND 29.7 ± 21.5 AT T12 (T0-T12 P < 0.001)] AND A DECREASE OF TENPS (FROM 2.88 ± 3.07 TO 1.70 ± 2.37 AND 1.77 ± 2.56 AT T0, T6 AND T12, RESPECTIVELY, T0-T12 P = 0.99). A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OF %FEV(1), ACT AND A DECREASE IN BLOOD EOSINOPHILS AND MEAN PREDNISONE INTAKE WERE ALSO REPORTED. NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DECREASING TREND WAS MEASURED FOR FENO. NASAL CYTOLOGY FINDINGS SUGGEST A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF EOSINOPHIL PERCENTAGE FOLLOWING MEPOLIZUMAB TREATMENT (FROM 16.8 ± 7.2% TO 3.6 ± 6.2% AND 0.8 ± 2.4% AT T0, T6 AND T12 RESPECTIVELY, T0 TO T12: P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: MEPOLIZUMAB IMPROVES SINO-NASAL AND ASTHMA SYMPTOMS AND REDUCES POLYP GROWTH IN PATIENTS WITH SEVERE EOSINOPHILIC ASTHMA AND CONCOMITANT CRSWNP IN REAL LIFE.THE REVIEWS OF THIS PAPER ARE AVAILABLE VIA THE SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL SECTION.","DEPARTMENT OF INTERNAL MEDICINE, CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY, CLINICAL PATHOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES, AOU FEDERICO II, VIA PANSINI 5, NAPLES, 80131, ITALY.; DIVISION OF ENT, AZIENDA OSPEDALIERA DEI COLLI, NAPLES, ITALY.; DEPARTMENT OF RESPIRATORY MEDICINE, AZIENDA OSPEDALIERA DEI COLLI, NAPLES, ITALY.; DEPARTMENT OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF CAMPANIA \"LUIGI VANVITELLI\", NAPLES, ITALY.; DEPARTMENT OF ADVANCED BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY FEDERICO II, NAPLES, ITALY.; PULMONARY REHABILITATION DIVISION ICS MAUGERI IRCCS, TELESE (BN), ITALY.; POST-GRADUATE PROGRAM IN CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY AND ALLERGY, UNIVERSITY FEDERICO II, NAPLES, ITALY.; POST-GRADUATE PROGRAM IN CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY AND ALLERGY, UNIVERSITY FEDERICO II, NAPLES, ITALY.; DEPARTMENT OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF CAMPANIA \"LUIGI VANVITELLI\", NAPLES, ITALY.; DEPARTMENT OF RESPIRATORY MEDICINE, AZIENDA OSPEDALIERA DEI COLLI, NAPLES, ITALY.; U.; O.; ALLERGOLOGY - NASAL CYTOLOGY, P.;A.;T.; LORETO CRISPI - DISTRICT, ASL NAPLES CENTER, NAPLES, ITALY.; DEPARTMENT OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICAL SCIENCES, ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY CENTER FOR BASIC AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY RESEARCH (CISI), UNIVERSITY OF NAPLES, ITALY.;","ORCID: 0000-0002-3692-1384",NA,NA,NA,"CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT: THE AUTHORS DECLARE THAT THERE IS NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST.","2021/04/29 05:26","20220215",NA,2021,"2021/04/30 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1753-4666 (ELECTRONIC) 1753-4658 (PRINT) 1753-4658 (LINKING)","101316317","THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN RESPIRATORY DISEASE","ENG","10.1177/17534666211009398 [DOI] 17534666211009398","20220215","2022/02/16 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","17534666211009398",NA,"PMC8107661",NA,"33910399","PPUBLISH","0 (ANTIBODIES, MONOCLONAL, HUMANIZED) 90Z2UF0E52 (MEPOLIZUMAB)","IM",NA,"THER ADV RESPIR DIS. 2021 JAN-DEC;15:17534666211009398.

ALTHOUGH SEEN AFTER PREVIOUS ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS), IT IS ALSO A DE NOVO FEATURE IN PATIENTS WITHOUT PRIOR INTERVENTIONS. IN THESE PATIENTS, OSTEITIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH TISSUE AND SERUM EOSINOPHILIA. HOWEVER, THE IMPACT OF OSTEITIS ON PROGNOSIS IS UNCLEAR. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE CLINICAL AND ENDOSCOPIC OUTCOMES BETWEEN PATIENTS WITH AND WITHOUT OSTEITIS AFTER PRIMARY ESS. METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF A COHORT OF PREVIOUSLY UNOPERATED PATIENTS WITH CRS UNDERGOING ESS WAS PERFORMED. THE SINUSES WERE SCORED RADIOLOGICALLY FOR OSTEITIS USING THE GLOBAL OSTEITIS SCORE (GOS) AND KENNEDY OSTEITIS SCORE (KOS) PREOPERATIVELY AND WERE ALSO SCORED DICHOTOMOUSLY FOR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF OSTEITIS. DISEASE-SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE (22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOMES TEST [SNOT-22]), NASAL SYMPTOM SCORE (NSS), ENDOSCOPIC SCORE (LUND-KENNEDY), AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES-INCLUDING ORAL STEROID USE, FREQUENCY OF NASAL STEROID IRRIGATION, AND INFECTIVE EXACERBATIONS-WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE AND 1 YEAR POSTSURGERY. THE PRESENCE AND EXTENT OF OSTEITIS WAS ASSESSED RELATIVE TO CLINICAL OUTCOME. RESULTS: FIFTY-THREE PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED (41.5% FEMALE, AGE 47.4 ± 13.8 YEARS), 42.9% OF WHICH HAD RADIOLOGIC OSTEITIS. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE PRESENCE OR SEVERITY OF OSTEITIS AT THE TIME OF SURGERY AND SNOT-22, NSS, OR ENDOSCOPY SCORES AT 12 MONTHS POSTSURGERY. HOWEVER, THE PRESENCE OF OSTEITIS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEED FOR A COURSE OF ORAL STEROID POSTSURGERY (ODDS RATIO [OR]=4.17; P = 0.026). HIGH TISSUE EOSINOPHILIA COULD NOT PREDICT THIS ALONE (P = 0.55). THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OSTEITIS AND THE FREQUENCY OF STEROID IRRIGATIONS OR INFECTIVE EXACERBATIONS. CONCLUSION: OSTEITIS IN CRS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEGREE OF EOSINOPHILIA AND AS A INDEPENDENT PROCESS IT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEED FOR A COURSE OF SYSTEMIC CORTICOSTEROID OVER A 12-MONTH PERIOD, BUT DID IT NOT AFFECT OVERALL DISEASE CONTROL.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF NSW, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, ST.; VINCENT'S HOSPITAL, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.;",NA,"© 2013 THE AUTHORS.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER BACTERIA ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CULTURE-NEGATIVE CASES. METHODS: WE INVESTIGATED 20 CASES OF CRS UNDERGOING FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY BY BOTH CULTURE AND 16S RRNA GENE POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR) FOLLOWED BY SEQUENCING. THE DISEASE SEVERITY WAS ASSESSED USING SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22) SCORING PREOPERATIVELY. RESULTS: OF THE 20 CASES STUDIED, ONLY FIVE WERE CULTURE-POSITIVE. BACTERIA WERE DETECTED IN ALL 15 CULTURE-NEGATIVE CASES BY 16S RRNA GENE PCR. SEQUENCING INDICATED THAT STAPHYLOCOCCUS IS THE DOMINANT GROUP, FOLLOWED BY ENTEROBACTER AND PSEUDOMONAS. IN TWO CASES, FROM WHICH PSEUDOMONAS WAS DETECTED, SNOT-22 SCORES WERE ABOVE 80, INDICATING HIGH DISEASE SEVERITY. CONCLUSION: 16S RRNA GENE PCR, FOLLOWED BY SEQUENCING, WOULD HELP THE CLINICIAN UNDERSTAND THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BACTERIA AND CRS.

DESPITE MAXIMAL MEDICAL THERAPY, SOME PATIENTS REMAIN RECALCITRANT. MUCUS CYSTATIN 2, PAPPALYSIN-A, AND PERIOSTIN CAN PREDICT THE PRESENCE OF CRSWNP AND CORRELATE WITH DISEASE SEVERITY. THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO DETERMINE WHETHER PROSPECTIVE SAMPLING OF THESE MUCUS PROTEINS COULD PREDICT MEDICAL FAILURE AND THE NEED FOR REVISION SURGERY. METHODS: THIS INVESTIGATION WAS AN INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD-APPROVED, PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF 66 PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP. ALL PATIENTS UNDERWENT SURGERY, ADMINISTRATION OF TOPICAL/ORAL STEROIDS, AND OUTPATIENT MUCUS SAMPLING AT 10 TIME-POINTS OVER 2 YEARS. FIVE PROTEINS, INCLUDING CYSTATIN 2 (CST2), PAPPALYSIN-A (PAPP-A), AND PERIOSTIN (PST), WERE ANALYZED AND CORRELATED WITH SUBJECTIVE PARAMETERS (INCLUDING SCORES ON THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOMES TEST [SNOT-22]). VARIABLES WERE THEN ANALYZED AND COMPARED BETWEEN THOSE REQUIRING REVISION SURGERY WITHIN 2 YEARS (N = 5) AND THOSE WITH STABLE DISEASE (N = 61). RESULTS: ALL PATIENTS DEMONSTRATED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN CST2, PAPP-A, AND PERIOSTIN AFTER THEIR INITIAL SURGERY. THE RECALCITRANT GROUP DEMONSTRATED ESCALATIONS IN ALL PROTEINS DESPITE STEROIDS, WITH LEVELS HIGHER THAN THOSE OF THE STABLE GROUP AT 1 YEAR (CST2: 258.1 ± 205.2 PG/ML VS 235.3 ± 275.7 PG/ML, P = 0.86; PAPP-A: 170.3 ± 150.4 PG/ML VS 74.6 ± 106.7 PG/ML, P < 0.05; PERIOSTIN: 188.8 ± 192.4 NG/ML VS 54.5 ± 47.6 NG/ML, P < 0.001). ESCALATION IN ALL PROTEINS CORRELATED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH WORSENING SNOT-22 SCORE AT EACH TIME-POINT (DOMAIN 1: 8.2 ± 1.3 VS 5.5 ± 1.1; P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: EARLY RECURRENCES AND MEDICAL RECALCITRANCE IN CRSWNP MAY BE PREDICTED NONINVASIVELY THROUGH THE SERIAL, PROSPECTIVE SAMPLING OF MUCUS CST2, PAPP-A, AND PERIOSTIN LEVELS. THESE BIOSIGNATURES MAY HELP TO PREDICT DISEASE COURSE AND GUIDE INDIVIDUALIZED THERAPY.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, FRIEDRICH-ALEXANDER-UNIVERSITÄT ERLANGEN-NÜRNBERG, ERLANGEN, GERMANY.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, FRIEDRICH-ALEXANDER-UNIVERSITÄT ERLANGEN-NÜRNBERG, ERLANGEN, GERMANY.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, FRIEDRICH-ALEXANDER-UNIVERSITÄT ERLANGEN-NÜRNBERG, ERLANGEN, GERMANY.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, FRIEDRICH-ALEXANDER-UNIVERSITÄT ERLANGEN-NÜRNBERG, ERLANGEN, GERMANY.; DEPARTMENT OF PATHOLOGY, FRIEDRICH-ALEXANDER-UNIVERSITÄT ERLANGEN-NÜRNBERG, ERLANGEN, GERMANY.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, FRIEDRICH-ALEXANDER-UNIVERSITÄT ERLANGEN-NÜRNBERG, ERLANGEN, GERMANY.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS, USA.;",NA,"© 2019 THE AUTHORS INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY PUBLISHED BY WILEY PERIODICALS, INC.

METHODS: 668 CRS PATIENTS UNDERGOING PRIMARY ESS WITH COMPLETE 60-MONTH FOLLOW-UP WERE EVALUATED IN THIS PROSPECTIVE, LONGITUDINAL COHORT STUDY. OUTCOMES WERE EVALUATED IN AN UNSELECTED COHORT AND A LOW-RISK COHORT, WHICH WAS COMPRISED OF PATIENTS WITHOUT A HISTORY OF ASTHMA OR ASPIRIN SENSITIVITY. RESULTS: FAILING TO ACHIEVE AN IMPROVEMENT OF GREATER THAN ONE MINIMAL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE (MCID; 9 POINTS) AT 3 MONTHS AFTER PRIMARY ESS AND A DETERIORATION OF GREATER THAN ONE MCID (IE. >9 POINTS) FROM THE 3- TO 12-MONTH FOLLOW-UP PERIODS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK OF REVISION ESS IN BOTH THE UNSELECTED AND LOW-RISK CRS COHORTS.

METHODS: THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED AS A PROSPECTIVE, MULTICENTER, SINGLE-ARM INVESTIGATION. CHILDREN (2 TO 21 YEARS OLD) WITH CRS WHO HAD FAILED MEDICAL MANAGEMENT WERE TREATED WITH BALLOON SINUS DILATION AND FOLLOWED TO 6 MONTHS POSTPROCEDURE. RESULTS: FIFTY CHILDREN WERE TREATED AT 4 CENTERS; 33 PARTICIPANTS WERE 2 TO 12 YEARS OLD (MEAN ± STANDARD DEVIATION AGE: 6.6 ± 2.2 YEARS) AND 17 PARTICIPANTS WERE >12 TO 21 YEARS (MEAN AGE: 15.7 ± 2.5 YEARS). A TOTAL OF 157 SINUS DILATIONS WERE ATTEMPTED (98 MAXILLARY, 30 FRONTAL, AND 29 SPHENOID SINUSES) AND ALL WERE SUCCESSFUL WITH NO COMPLICATIONS. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE SINUS AND NASAL QUALITY OF LIFE SURVEY (SN-5) WAS SEEN FOR ALL CHILDREN BETWEEN BASELINE AND 6 MONTHS (4.6 ± 1.2 VS 1.7 ± 0.8; P < 0.0001) AND 92% IMPROVED BY A MINIMAL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE (MCID) OF 1.0 OR MORE. THOSE CHILDREN AGED 2 TO 12 YEARS WITH STANDALONE BALLOON DILATION ALSO SHOWED SIGNIFICANT SN-5 IMPROVEMENTS BETWEEN BASELINE AND FOLLOW-UP (4.5 ± 1.0 VS 1.9 ± 0.8; P < 0.0001). MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION ANALYSIS SHOWED NO DIFFERENCES OR ASSOCIATIONS OF SN-5 IMPROVEMENT AT 6 MONTHS WITH THE PRESENCE OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA, OR CONCOMITANT PROCEDURES. FOR ADOLESCENTS, OVERALL 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) MEAN SCORES WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED AT 6 MONTHS (42.2 ± 19.2 VS 10.4 ± 9.7; P < 0.0001).

IT CALLS INTO ATTENTION CONSENSUS ABOUT DIAGNOSING, ASSESSING SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH CRS. THEREFORE, A VALIDATED DANISH MEASURE OF HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN SINONASAL DISEASE IS NEEDED. MATERIAL AND METHODS: THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST 22 (SNOT-22) WAS TRANSLATED INTO DANISH AND ITS REPRODUCIBILITY WAS EVALUATED BY TEST-RETESTING 40 PATIENTS WITH CRS. THE STATISTICAL ANALYSES USED WERE PEARSON'S CORRELATION COEFFICIENT, CRONBACH'S ALPHA, KAPPA AND BLAND-ALTMAN'S PLOT. REPRODUCIBILITY WAS ALSO TESTED FOR SNOT-22 SUBSCALES. RESULTS: THE RESULTS SHOW GOOD INTERNAL CORRELATION WITH A CRONBACH'S ALPHA OF 0.83 IN THE INITIAL TEST AND ONE OF 0.92 IN THE RETEST. PEARSON'S CORRELATION COEFFICIENT WAS 0.70 (P < 0.001), REVEALING GOOD CORRELATION BETWEEN THE INITIAL SCORES AND THE RETESTS SCORES. KAPPA WAS CALCULATED FOR EACH ITEM WITH A MEAN VALUE OF 0.61 SHOWING SUBSTANTIAL AGREEMENT. THE PAIRED T-TEST REVEALED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SUBSCALES.

STUDY DESIGN: PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. SETTING: TERTIARY REFERRAL CENTER; IBN ROCHD UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, CASABLANCA, MOROCCO. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: THE SNOT-22 WAS CONDUCTED IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS) UNDERGOING SINONASAL SURGERY AND IN HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS, FROM JANUARY 2012 TO DECEMBER 2013. IT WAS TRANSLATED INTO MOROCCAN ARABIC LANGUAGE. TO EVALUATE THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, INTERNAL CONSISTENCY, TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY, RESPONSIVENESS TO TREATMENT, AND VALIDITY WERE ANALYZED. RESULTS: PREOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORES WERE COMPLETED BY 88 PATIENTS. SIX-MONTH POSTOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORES WERE AVAILABLE FOR 74 PATIENTS. THE CRONBACH'S ALPHA COEFFICIENT FOR THE SNOT-22 WAS 0.968, INDICATING HIGH INTERNAL CONSISTENCY. THE TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY COEFFICIENT WAS 0.993, INDICATING HIGH RELIABILITY WHEN ADMINISTERING THE INSTRUMENT ON REPEATED OCCASIONS. THE MOROCCAN VERSION OF THE SNOT-22 WAS ABLE TO HIGHLY DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN PATIENTS WITH CRS AND GROUP OF HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS (P < .0001). THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PATIENT REPORTED SNOT-22 SCORES AT 6 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: THE PRESENT STUDY HAS FOUND THE MOROCCAN VERSION OF SNOT-22 TO BE VALID AND EASY TO USE WITH GOOD RELIABILITY, VALIDITY, AND RESPONSIVENESS.

THEY WERE FOLLOWED UP FOR THREE MONTHS AT AN INTERVAL OF ONE MONTH. AND WE RECRUITED HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS' SAMPLES AS WELL. ALL SPECIMENS WERE ANALYZED BY THE SECOND-GENERATION HIGH-THROUGHPUT SEQUENCING, COLLECTING SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE DATA, AND ANALYZED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM. RESULT:<U+2460>THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE OF <U+0391> DIVERSITY BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS(SHANNON INDEX WERE 4.41 VS. 3.89).

ALTHOUGH MULTIPLE STAGING SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AND EVALUATED, EVIDENCE OF ASSOCIATION BETWEEN CONCURRENT SYMPTOMS AND ENDOSCOPIC FINDINGS REMAINS DISCORDANT. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO IDENTIFY THE RELEVANT ENDOSCOPIC ATTRIBUTES ASSOCIATED WITH SYMPTOM BURDEN, AND TO SYSTEMATICALLY DERIVE A WEIGHTED ENDOSCOPIC SCALE THAT OPTIMIZES PREDICTION OF CONCURRENT SYMPTOMS. METHODS: REPORTED BASELINE SYMPTOM (22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST [SNOT-22]) AND ENDOSCOPIC EVALUATION SCORES (LUND-KENNEDY [LK]) WERE OBTAINED FROM PATIENTS WITH CRS ENROLLED IN A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. CANONICAL CORRELATION ANALYSIS OF THE SNOT-22 SUBDOMAINS AND LK VARIABLES WAS COMPLETED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 629 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED IN ANALYSIS INCLUDING 343 WITH PRIOR ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY. SIGNIFICANT CANONICAL CORRELATIONS OUTPERFORMED AGGREGATE CORRELATIONS IN EXPLAINING VARIANCE OF THE DATA (33% VS 3%, RESPECTIVELY). THE FIRST CANONICAL CORRELATION WAS DOMINATED BY THE RHINOLOGIC SYMPTOM DOMAIN AND THE ENDOSCOPIC POLYP SCORE (R = 0.54; P < 0.05) WHEREAS ADDITIONAL SIGNIFICANT CANONICAL CORRELATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE EXTRA-RHINOLOGIC SYMPTOM SUBDOMAIN AND THE EDEMA SCORE IN PATIENTS WITHOUT PRIOR ESS (R = 0.21; P < 0.05), AND DISCHARGE IN PATIENTS WITH PRIOR ESS (R = 0.22; P < 0.05). ALL OTHER DOMAINS AND ENDOSCOPIC VARIABLES DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE CANONICAL CORRELATION. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH AGGREGATE SYMPTOMS AND ENDOSCOPIC SCORES DEMONSTRATE MINIMAL CORRELATION, A WEIGHTED COMBINATION OF SYMPTOM DOMAINS AND ENDOSCOPIC ATTRIBUTES GREATLY IMPROVES THIS CORRELATION. A SIMPLE APPROXIMATION OF THE WEIGHTS OF EACH OF THE ENDOSCOPIC VARIABLES OF POLYPS, EDEMA, DISCHARGE, SCARRING, AND CRUSTING, IS AN APPROXIMATE RATIO OF 4:2:1:0:0, RESPECTIVELY.","DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO, SAN DIEGO, CA.; DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY, PORTLAND STATE UNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OR.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, OREGON HEALTH AND SCIENCE UNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OR.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF UTAH SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, SALT LAKE CITY, UT.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY, CALGARY, ALBERTA, CANADA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, OREGON HEALTH AND SCIENCE UNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OR.;",NA,"© 2015 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,"POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: NONE TO REPORT","2015/12/19 06:00","20171108","20151217",2016,"2015/12/19 06:00",NA,NA,"R01 DC005805/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/UNITED STATES","5",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (PRINT) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.21683 [DOI]","20181113","2017/11/09 06:00","NIHMS749969",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","478-85",NA,"PMC4856574",NA,"26678860","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM","CLINICALTRIALS.GOV/NCT01332136","INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2016 MAY;6(5):478-85.

METHODS: A TOTAL OF 150 PARTICIPANTS WITH AGES > 18 YEARS AND PERSISTENT ALLERGIC RHINITIS WERE PROSPECTIVELY RECRUITED FOR THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY. GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL WAS MEASURED BY USING THE VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS) FROM THE FIVE-DIMENSION EUROQOL QOL SURVEY (EQ-5D). THE SEVERITY OF NASAL AND EXTRANASAL SYMPTOMS WAS MEASURED BY USING THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). THE SEVERITY OF NASAL OBSTRUCTION WAS MEASURED BY USING THE NASAL OBSTRUCTION SEVERITY EVALUATION (NOSE) SCALE. EACH PARTICIPANT ALSO COMPLETED A RHINITIS CONTROL ASSESSMENT TEST (RCAT). RESULTS: THE TOTAL SNOT-22 SCORE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH RCAT (R = -0.68 [95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL {CI}, -0.75 TO -0.58]; P < 0.001) AND EQ-5D VAS (R = -0.44 [95% CI, -0.56 TO -0.30]; P < 0.001).

A DISCUSSION IS ONGOING ABOUT WHETHER THERE MIGHT BE AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THESE TWO DISEASES AND, IF SO, WHETHER THE ASSOCIATION IS CAUSAL. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO CLINICALLY INVESTIGATE THE PREVALENCE AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY SCORES OF CRS AMONG PATIENTS WITH GERD. THE RESULTS WERE COMPARED WITH THOSE OF A RANDOMLY ASSIGNED CONTROL GROUP FROM THE GENERAL DANISH POPULATION. METHOD: IN THIS CASE-CONTROL STUDY, 82 PATIENTS WITH GERD WERE EXAMINED FOR CRS USING THE EUROPEAN POSITION PAPER ON RHINOSINUSITIS AND NASAL POLYPS CRITERIA, WHICH COMBINE PATIENT HISTORY AND ANTERIOR/POSTERIOR RHINOSCOPY RESULTS. SINONASAL-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE WAS ASSESSED BY USING THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST 22 (SNOT-22). THESE RESULTS WERE COMPARED WITH THOSE OF A POPULATION-BASED CONTROL GROUP EXAMINED FOR CRS IN THE SAME WAY. RESULTS: THE PREVALENCE OF CRS AMONG PATIENTS WITH GERD WAS 20.7% (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], 12.0%-29.5%), SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE CRS PREVALENCE OF 8.5% (95% CI, 6.8%-10.2%) IN THE BACKGROUND POPULATION.

PATIENTS ON ANTIPLATELET AND ANTICOAGULANT THERAPIES (AAT) USUALLY ARE RECOMMENDED TO DISCONTINUE THEIR MEDICATIONS AROUND THE PERIOD OF ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO ASSESS THE CLINICAL EXPERIENCE OF BSD IN CRSSNP PATIENTS WITH CONCURRENT ANTICOAGULANT OR ANTIPLATELET THERAPY. METHODS: A REVIEW OF PROSPECTIVELY-COLLECTED CLINICAL DATA FROM OCTOBER 2012 TO MARCH 2017 WERE USED TO PERFORM A COHORT STUDY OF SUBJECTS WITH CRSSNP WHO MET CRITERIA FOR SURGICAL INTERVENTION WHILE ON ANTIPLATELET AND ANTICOAGULANT THERAPY. DATA WERE COLLECTED ON DEMOGRAPHICS, DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURES, TYPE OF AAT USED, PRE- AND POSTOPERATIVE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES, AND COMPLICATIONS. RESULTS: THIRTY-FIVE PATIENTS UNDERWENT IN-OFFICE BSD WHILE ON ANTIPLATELET AND/OR ANTICOAGULANT THERAPY. THE MEAN DIFFERENCE IN PRE- AND POSTOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORES OF 9.9 (SD 14.4, P < .001) WAS BOTH STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AND EXCEEDED THE MINIMAL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE OF 8.9. ABSORBABLE NASAL PACKING WAS USED FOR PERSISTENT BLEEDING IMMEDIATELY POST-PROCEDURE IN TWO PATIENTS. INTRAOPERATIVE BLEEDING WAS ASSOCIATED WITH ASPIRIN 325 MG AND WARFARIN. FESS WAS REQUIRED FOR FURTHER MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC SINUSITIS IN FOUR PATIENTS AFTER ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET THERAPY COULD BE DISCONTINUED. THERE WERE NO SYSTEMIC COMPLICATIONS. NONE OF THE PATIENTS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT BLEEDING EVENTS POSTOPERATIVELY AFTER LEAVING THE OFFICE. CONCLUSION: IN-OFFICE BSD APPEARS TO BE A SAFE ALTERNATIVE TO ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY IN SELECT PATIENTS WHO CANNOT DISCONTINUE ANTIPLATELET AND ANTICOAGULANT THERAPY.

IDENTIFICATION OF GENETIC MARKERS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO CRS SYMPTOMS IN THESE PATIENTS CAN ALLOW FOR RISK STRATIFICATION AND TAILORING OF MEDICAL AND SURGICAL TREATMENTS. T2R38 IS A BITTER TASTE RECEPTOR EXPRESSED IN THE SINONASAL TRACT, AND NONFUNCTIONAL ALLELES OF THIS RECEPTOR HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED IN TREATMENT-REFRACTORY CRS IN NON-CF PATIENTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF T2R38 GENOTYPE IN THE VARIABILITY OF SINONASAL QOL AND CRS DISEASE SEVERITY IN A SAMPLE OF CF PATIENTS. METHODS: <U+0394>F508 HOMOZYGOUS CF PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA CYSTIC FIBROSIS CENTER AND WERE GENOTYPED FOR THE TAS2R38 LOCUS. TO ASSESS SINONASAL SYMPTOM SEVERITY, A 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) WAS COLLECTED FROM EACH PATIENT. ADDITIONAL DEMOGRAPHIC AND MEDICAL HISTORY DATA WAS OBTAINED AT THE TIME OF PATIENT ENROLLMENT. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 49 <U+0394>F508 HOMOZYGOUS CF PATIENTS AGED 18 TO 32 YEARS WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL SNOT-22 SCORE ANALYSIS. INDIVIDUALS WITH 2 FUNCTIONAL T2R38 ALLELES (PAV/PAV) HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SNOT-22 SCORES (N = 49, P < 0.05). ON FURTHER BREAKDOWN OF SNOT-22 SUBCATEGORIES, RHINOLOGIC SYMPTOMS SPECIFICALLY WERE LESS SEVERE IN PAV/PAV PATIENTS THAN PATIENTS WITH OTHER GENOTYPES (N = 47, P < 0.05).

OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS THE ASSOCIATION OF NONMEDICATED CONTROL SUBSTANCES IN RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS WITH DISEASE OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: IN THIS SINGLE-ARM SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS, OVID MEDLINE, EMBASE, PUBMED, AND CLINICALTRIALS.GOV DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS WITH A PREINTERVENTION AND POSTINTERVENTION DESIGN FOR CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS THAT WERE PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1946 AND JANUARY 23, 2019. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: PAIRED REVIEWERS INDEPENDENTLY EXTRACTED DATA. THE ANALYSES USED RANDOM-EFFECTS MODELS AND THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS ASSESSMENT TO RATE THE QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE THE ASSOCIATION OF NONMEDICATED CONTROL SUBSTANCES WITH 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES OR NASAL SYMPTOM SCORES WHEN SNOT-22 WAS NOT AVAILABLE. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 2305 ABSTRACTS WERE IDENTIFIED AND SCREENED, 725 ARTICLES WERE REVIEWED IN FULL TEXT, AND 38 ARTICLES MET THE STUDY CRITERIA AND WERE INCLUDED IN THE META-ANALYSIS. AMONG THE 38 INCLUDED STUDIES, A TOTAL OF 2258 ADULTS (MEAN AGE RANGE, 27-53 YEARS; 20.0%-72.5% WOMEN) WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE NONMEDICATED CONTROL SUBSTANCES OR SHAM INTERVENTIONS. TOPICAL NONMEDICATED CONTROL SUBSTANCES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SNOT-22 SCORES (MEAN DIFFERENCE [MD], -8.81; 95% CI, -12.60 TO -5.03). A SUBGROUP ANALYSIS OF TOPICAL THERAPIES, LIMITED TO SALINE IRRIGATION AND NASAL SPRAY DILUENTS, FOUND THAT TOPICAL DILUENTS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH A GREATER REDUCTION IN SNOT-22 SCORES (MD, -11.45; 95% CI, -13.50 TO -9.41) COMPARED WITH SALINE IRRIGATION (MD, -13.60; 95% CI, -19.95 TO -7.25). NONMEDICATED CONTROL SUBSTANCES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN NASAL OBSTRUCTION SCORES (STANDARDIZED MD [SMD], -0.42; 95% CI, -0.81 TO -0.03). NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WAS FOUND IN RHINORRHEA SCORES (SMD, -0.34; 95% CI, -1.37 TO 0.69), POSTNASAL DRIP SCORES (SMD, -0.96; 95% CI, -2.18 TO 0.25), FACIAL PAIN SCORES (SMD, -0.57; 95% CI, -1.68 TO 0.55), OR LOSS OF SMELL SCORES (SMD, -0.18; 95% CI, -0.68 TO 0.32). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF THE USE OF NONMEDICATED CONTROL SUBSTANCES IN RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS OF CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS OUTCOMES SUGGESTS THAT THE USE OF NONMEDICATED CONTROL SUBSTANCES IS ASSOCIATED WITH LIMITED IMPROVEMENTS IN SNOT-22 AND NASAL OBSTRUCTION SCORES.

AMONG THESE ELECTIVE SURGERIES IS ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS) PERFORMED FOR TREATMENT OF CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS). LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE IMPACT OF WAIT TIMES ON PATIENTS' SURGICAL OUTCOMES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PATIENTS' WAIT TIMES AND POSTOPERATIVE PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES. METHODS: THIS STUDY WAS BASED ON A PROSPECTIVELY RECRUITED LONGITUDINAL COHORT OF PATIENTS BOOKED FOR ESS FOR THE TREATMENT OF MEDICALLY-REFRACTORY CRS IN VANCOUVER, CANADA. PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 2012 AND DECEMBER 2016. ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) PREOPERATIVELY AND 6 MONTHS POSTOPERATIVELY. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS PARTICIPANTS' CHANGE IN SNOT-22 SCORE. A REGRESSION MODEL MEASURED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME, WAIT TIME, AND POTENTIAL CONFOUNDERS. RESULTS: THE STUDY INCLUDED 150 PARTICIPANTS. THE MEAN SURGICAL WAIT TIME WAS 32 WEEKS. THE MEAN PREOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORE WAS 40.0. THE IMPROVEMENT IN SNOT-22 SCORES FOLLOWING ESS WAS 18 POINTS. REGRESSION ANALYSIS FOUND NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN WAIT TIME FOR ESS AND THE CHANGE IN SNOT-22 SCORES AFTER SURGERY (P = 0.42). ONLY PREOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORE CORRELATED WITH OUTCOME SCORES. CONCLUSION: THERE WAS NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE GAINS IN HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE AND THE LENGTH OF TIME PARTICIPANTS WAITED FOR SURGERY. THE LARGEST GAINS IN HEALTH WERE CONCENTRATED AMONG PARTICIPANTS WITH THE HIGHEST SYMPTOM BURDEN, IRRESPECTIVE OF WAIT TIME. THIS RESULT SUGGESTS THAT IT MAY BE SAFE TO TRIAGE PATIENTS BASED ON SYMPTOM SEVERITY AS AN APPROACH TO MAXIMIZING THE POPULATION'S OVERALL HEALTH.","DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA.; RHINOLOGY AND SKULL BASE SURGERY, DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA.; CENTRE FOR HEALTH SERVICES AND POLICY RESEARCH, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA.; CENTRE FOR HEALTH SERVICES AND POLICY RESEARCH, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA.; DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY, CALGARY, AB, CANADA.; CENTRE FOR HEALTH SERVICES AND POLICY RESEARCH, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA.;",NA,"© 2017 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2017/09/24 06:00","20180718","20170922",2017,"2017/09/25 06:00",NA,NA,"CIHR/CANADA","12",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.22018 [DOI]","20180725","2018/07/19 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","1156-1161","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"28941212","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2017 DEC;7(12):1156-1161.

METHODS: A TOTAL OF 61 ADULT PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WERE ANALYZED. CONE-BEAM COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHIC IMAGES OF THE PARANASAL SINUSES WERE EXAMINED PREOPERATIVELY AND AT 12 MONTHS POSTOPERATIVELY. THE RESULTS WERE COMPARED USING THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AND THE LUND-MACKAY (LM) AND ZINREICH MODIFIED STAGING SYSTEMS. RESULTS: THE MEAN CHANGE IN PNEUMATIZED VOLUMES IN THE MAXILLARY SINUSES AFTER OPERATIVE TREATMENT PER PATIENT WAS 2.0 ± 7.5 CM(3) ( P = .146). THE MEDIAN FOR VOLUMETRIC CHANGE WAS 0.97 CM(3) (RANGE, -11.6 TO 33.6 CM(3)). BOTH THE LM AND ZINREICH MODIFIED LM STAGING SYSTEMS SHOWED NO CHANGE IN 32 OF 61 PATIENTS (53%). THE ALTERATIONS IN PATIENTS' MAXILLARY SINUSES MEASURED USING THE VOLUMETRIC MEASUREMENT METHOD CORRELATED WELL WITH CHANGES IN ZINREICH'S MODIFIED LM STAGING (-0.77, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: THE 3D VOLUMETRIC METHOD IS MORE SENSITIVE IN DETECTING SMALL ALTERATIONS IN PNEUMATIZED VOLUMES OF THE MAXILLARY SINUSES THAN ZINREICH'S MODIFIED LM STAGING AND LM STAGING.

NUMEROUS PATIENT FACTORS HAVE BEEN LINKED TO DIFFERENCES IN DISEASE SEVERITY, CONTROL, AND RESPONSE TO TREATMENT, INCLUDING ASTHMA STATUS, ASPIRIN SENSITIVITY, PREVIOUS SINONASAL SURGERY, AND BLOOD EOSINOPHIL LEVELS. OBJECTIVE: THE PRESENT STUDY EXAMINES THE EFFICACY OF THE ANTI-IMMUNOGLOBULIN E THERAPY, OMALIZUMAB, VERSUS PLACEBO IN PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP FROM THE REPLICATE POLYP 1 (NCT03280550) AND POLYP 2 (NCT03280537) TRIALS, GROUPED BY INHERENT PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS TO DETERMINE THE RESPONSE TO THERAPY. METHODS: PATIENTS IN PRESPECIFIED SUBGROUPS FROM POLYP 1 AND POLYP 2 (STUDIES POOLED FOR ANALYSIS) WERE EXAMINED. SUBGROUPS INCLUDED BLOOD EOSINOPHIL COUNT AT BASELINE (>300 OR =300 CELLS/<U+039C>L), PREVIOUS SINONASAL SURGERY (YES OR NO), ASTHMA STATUS (YES OR NO), AND ASPIRIN SENSITIVITY STATUS (YES OR NO). SUBGROUPS WERE EXAMINED FOR SUBGROUP-SPECIFIC ADJUSTED MEAN DIFFERENCE (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI]) (OMALIZUMAB-PLACEBO) IN CHANGE FROM BASELINE AT WEEK 24 IN NASAL CONGESTION SCORE (NCS), NASAL POLYP SCORE (NPS), SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22), TOTAL NASAL SYMPTOM SCORE (TNSS), AND UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA SMELL IDENTIFICATION TEST (UPSIT). RESULTS: ADJUSTED MEAN DIFFERENCE (95% CI) (OMALIZUMAB-PLACEBO) IN NCS, NPS, SNOT-22, TNSS, AND UPSIT CHANGE FROM BASELINE AT WEEK 24 CONSISTENTLY FAVORED OMALIZUMAB TREATMENT OVER PLACEBO IN PATIENTS WITH BLOOD EOSINOPHIL COUNT >300 AND =300 CELLS/<U+039C>L, WITH OR WITHOUT PREVIOUS SINONASAL SURGERY, ASTHMA, AND ASPIRIN SENSITIVITY. CONCLUSION: TOGETHER, THESE DATA SUGGEST BROAD EFFICACY OF OMALIZUMAB ACROSS CLINICAL AND PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP, INDEPENDENT OF THE UNDERLYING PATIENT FACTORS EXAMINED, INCLUDING THOSE WITH HIGH EOSINOPHIL LEVELS AND THOSE WHO HAVE UNDERGONE PREVIOUS SURGERY, WHICH ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH RECURRENCE.

THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN SYMPTOMS AND CT FINDINGS BEFORE AND AFTER FESS FOR CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS. IN ADDITION, THE INTEROBSERVER AGREEMENT FOR BOTH SINONASAL AERIAL VOLUMETRY AND CT SCORE IS ASSESSED. METHODS: THIRTY-THREE PATIENTS SURGICALLY TREATED FOR CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WERE INCLUDED IN THIS PROSPECTIVE STUDY. CONVENTIONAL AND MODIFIED LUND-MACKAY SCORES AND SINONASAL VOLUMETRY WERE DETERMINED BY TWO RADIOLOGISTS BEFORE (M0), AT 3 MONTHS (M3) AND 1 YEAR (M12) AFTER SURGERY. THE SYMPTOMS WERE EVALUATED BY THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). RESULTS: CHANGE OF SNOT-22 AND AIR VOLUME WERE SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED BETWEEN M0 AND M12, BUT NOT BETWEEN M0 AND M3, FOR BOTH READERS. COMPARED TO OTHER SCORES, VOLUME HAD THE BEST INTRACLASS CORRELATION COEFFICIENT AND REPRODUCIBILITY, ACCORDING TO THE BLAND-ALTMAN ANALYSIS. NO CORRELATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN SNOT-22 AND CT SCORES BEFORE AND AFTER SURGERY, EXCEPT BETWEEN M12 AND M0 FOR ONE READER. CONCLUSION: THE CORRELATION BETWEEN CT SCAN AND SYMPTOMS IS LOW OR ABSENT.

THE PURPOSE OF OUR STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE FURTHER SINUS HEADACHE COMPARING THE EFFECT OF CONVENTIONAL FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY AND THE BALLOON SINUPLASTY. MATERIAL AND METHODS: EIGHTY-THREE CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED FROM 2009 TO 2012, WHO WERE DIAGNOSED SINUS HEADACHE ACCORDING THE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA OF AAO-HNS AND OF HIS. 40 PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO CONVENTIONAL ENDOSCOPY SINUS SURGERY FOR FRONTAL SINUS (ESS GROUP), 35 TO BALLOON SINUPLASTY OF FRONTAL SINUS (BS GROUP). RESULTS: THE MEAN OPERATIVE TIME WAS 65 ± 15 MIN FOR ESS GROUP PATIENTS AND 32 ± 7 MIN FOR 23 PATIENTS (BS1 GROUP) AND 55 ± 18 MIN FOR 12 TREATED WITH HYBRID TECHNIQUE (BS2 GROUP).

IT IS NOW CLEAR THAT CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS) IS A MULTIFACTORIAL DISEASE WITH SUBSETS OF PATIENTS WHICH MAY REQUIRE A MORE EXTENSIVE SURGICAL APPROACH. THIS STUDY COMPARES QUALITY-OF-LIFE (QOL) AND DISEASE SEVERITY OUTCOMES AFTER FESS BASED ON THE EXTENT OF SURGICAL INTERVENTION. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WITH CRS WERE PROSPECTIVELY ENROLLED INTO AN ONGOING, MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL, OBSERVATIONAL, COHORT STUDY. SURGICAL EXTENT WAS DETERMINED BY PHYSICIAN DISCRETION. PARTICIPANTS UNDERGOING BILATERAL FRONTAL SINUSOTOMY, ETHMOIDECTOMY, MAXILLARY ANTROSTOMY, AND SPHENOIDOTOMY WERE CONSIDERED TO HAVE UNDERGONE \"COMPLETE\" SURGERY, WHEREAS ALL OTHER PARTICIPANTS WERE CATEGORIZED AS RECEIVING \"TARGETED\" SURGERY. IMPROVEMENT WAS EVALUATED BETWEEN SURGICAL SUBGROUPS WITH AT LEAST 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP USING THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AND THE BRIEF SMELL INVENTORY TEST (B-SIT). RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 311 PARTICIPANTS MET INCLUSION CRITERIA WITH 147 SUBJECTS UNDERGOING COMPLETE SURGERY AND 164 TARGETED SURGERY. A HIGHER PREVALENCE OF ASTHMA, ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID (ASA) SENSITIVITY, NASAL POLYPOSIS, AND A HISTORY OF PRIOR SINUS SURGERY (P = 0.002) WAS PRESENT IN PARTICIPANTS UNDERGOING COMPLETE SURGERY. MEAN IMPROVEMENT IN SNOT-22 (28.1 ± 21.9 VS 21.9 ± 20.6; P = 0.011) AND B-SIT (0.8 ± 3.1 VS 0.2 ± 2.4; P = 0.005) WAS GREATER IN SUBJECTS UNDERGOING COMPLETE SURGERY. REGRESSION MODELS DEMONSTRATED A 5.9 ± 2.5 GREATER RELATIVE MEAN IMPROVEMENT ON SNOT-22 TOTAL SCORES WITH COMPLETE SURGERY OVER TARGETED APPROACHES (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: COMPLETE SURGERY WAS AN INDEPENDENT PREDICTOR OF GREATER POSTOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORE IMPROVEMENT, YET DID NOT ACHIEVE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE.

OBJECTIVE: WE SOUGHT TO DETERMINE WHETHER LONGITUDINAL CHANGES IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF CRS SYMPTOMATOLOGY LEAD TO CORRESPONDINGLY DIFFERENT MAGNITUDE CHANGES IN GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL. METHODS: PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL STUDY OF 145 PATIENTS UNDERGOING MEDICAL MANAGEMENT FOR CRS. CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS SYMPTOM SEVERITY WAS MEASURED USING THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AND ASSOCIATED NASAL, SLEEP, EAR/FACIAL DISCOMFORT, AND EMOTIONAL SUBDOMAINS OF THE SNOT-22. GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL WAS MEASURED USING THE 5-DIMENSIONAL EUROQOL QUESTIONNAIRE'S VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (EQ-5D VAS). THESE DATA WERE COLLECTED AT 2 TIME POINTS: AT ENROLLMENT AND AT A SUBSEQUENT FOLLOW-UP VISIT WITHIN THE NEXT 2 TO 6 MONTHS. ASSOCIATIONS WERE SOUGHT BETWEEN THE CHANGES IN SNOT-22 AND EQ-5D VAS. RESULTS: THE CHANGE IN SNOT-22 WAS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGE IN EQ-5D VAS (ADJUSTED LINEAR REGRESSION COEFFICIENT [<U+0392>] = -0.37, 95%CI: -0.51 TO -0.24, P < .001). THE CHANGE IN EQ-5D VAS WAS ONLY ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN THE SLEEP (ADJUSTED <U+0392> = -0.42, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [95%CI]: -0.81 TO -0.04, P = .034) AND EAR/FACIAL DISCOMFORT (ADJUSTED <U+0392> = -1.00, 95%CI: -1.89 TO -0.10, P = .031) SUBDOMAINS BUT NOT NASAL (ADJUSTED <U+0392> = -0.12, 95%CI: -0.52 TO 0.28, P = .564) OR EMOTIONAL (ADJUSTED <U+0392> = -0.17, 95%CI: -1.83 TO 1.49, P = .840) SUBDOMAINS. CONCLUSION: CHANGES IN THE SEVERITY OF SLEEP AND EAR/FACIAL DISCOMFORT SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATE MOST GREATLY WITH THE CHANGE IN GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL THAT CRS PATIENTS EXPERIENCE DURING ROUTINE MEDICAL MANAGEMENT. REDUCTION OF THESE EXTRANASAL SYMPTOMS OF CRS MAY THEREFORE LEAD TO THE GREATEST IMPROVEMENT IN GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL.","KLINIK FÜR HALS-, NASEN-, OHREN- KRANKHEITEN, HALS-UND GESICHTSCHIRURGIE, KANTONSSPITAL AARAU, SWITZERLAND.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY AND COMMUNICATIONS ENHANCEMENT, BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: AHMAD_SEDAGHAT@MEEI.;HARVARD.;EDU.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT © 2018 AMERICAN COLLEGE OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGY.

METHODS: ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-SIX PATIENTS WITH CF REFERRED TO A TERTIARY RHINOLOGY PRACTICE WERE RETROSPECTIVELY DIVIDED INTO 3 COHORTS: MEDICAL, UPFRONT SURGERY, OR CROSSOVER, IF THEY CONVERTED FROM MEDICAL TO SURGICAL MANAGEMENT. THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AND PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST (PFT) DATA WERE ASSESSED UP TO 48 MONTHS. RESULTS: COMPARED TO PATIENTS INITIALLY MANAGED MEDICALLY (N = 90), THOSE WHO PURSUED UPFRONT SURGERY (N = 46) HAD A GREATER INCIDENCE OF NASAL POLYPOSIS (P = 0.0011), PRIOR SINUS SURGERY (P = 0.0025), LOWER PERCENT-PREDICTED FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 SECOND (%FEV(1) ) (P = 0.0063), AND HIGHER LUND-MACKAY (P = 0.0025) AND SNOT-22 (P = 0.0229) SCORES.

HOWEVER, THE EVIDENCE IS LIMITED AND INSUFFICIENT, AND FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS ARE REQUIRED. OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF TOPICAL FUROSEMIDE ON RECURRENCE RATE OF RHINOSINUSAL POLYPOSIS AFTER ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: TRIPLE-BLIND RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL OF PATIENTS AGED 18 TO 60 YEARS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS ASSOCIATED WITH POLYPOSIS WHO DID NOT RESPOND TO MEDICAL TREATMENT AND WERE CANDIDATES FOR ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY AT BESAT HOSPITAL, HAMADAN UNIVERSITY OF MEDICAL SCIENCES, FROM APRIL 2014 TO JUNE 2015. INTERVENTIONS: PATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO RECEIVE POSTOPERATIVE NASAL SPRAY, 2 PUFFS TWICE A DAY FOR 2 MONTHS, EITHER 300 µG OF FUROSEMIDE PER DAY OR PLACEBO. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: SIX MONTHS AFTER SURGERY, THE PATIENTS WERE EXAMINED FOR NASAL AND PARANASAL SINUS POLYPOSIS USING MELTZER ENDOSCOPIC GRADING, COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHIC (CT) SCAN OF PARANASAL SINUSES (PNS) SCORING, SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORING, AND VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS). RESULTS: OF 110 PATIENTS ENROLLED, 84 PATIENTS REMAINED FOR ANALYSIS (53 MEN AND 31 WOMEN; MEAN AGE IN THE FUROSEMIDE GROUP, 37.02 YEARS, RANGE, 18-58 YEARS; MEAN AGE IN THE PLACEBO GROUP, 36.30 YEARS, RANGE, 18-60 YEARS). SIX MONTHS AFTER THE INTERVENTION, THE GRADE OF POLYPOSIS DECREASED IN BOTH GROUPS, BUT THIS REDUCTION WAS SUBSTANTIAL IN THE FUROSEMIDE GROUP VS THE PLACEBO GROUP. THE SEVERITY OF POLYPOSIS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN THE FUROSEMIDE GROUP VS THE PLACEBO GROUP BASED ON SNOT-22 SCORING (DIFFERENCE, 8.05; 95% CI, 3.24-12.85) AND VAS (DIFFERENCE, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.22-1.39) BUT NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BASED ON CT SCAN OF PNS SCORING (DIFFERENCE, 2.52; 95% CI, -0.35 TO 5.39). THE INCIDENCE OF ADVERSE EFFECTS (NASAL IRRITATION, HEADACHE, AND CONSTIPATION) WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE 2 GROUPS. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT TOPICAL FUROSEMIDE IS A SAFE DRUG, WITH NO IMPORTANT ADVERSE EFFECTS, THAT CAN SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE SEVERITY OF POLYPOSIS AFTER ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY.

BIOPSIES OF NASAL POLYPS (NPS) WERE OBTAINED FROM THESE SUBJECTS. THEIR CLINICAL INDEXES WERE SCORED USING VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS), SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT)-22, AND ENDOSCOPIC APPEARANCES (EAS). HISTOLOGICAL ANALYSES WERE USED TO ASSESS NUMBERS OF NEUTROPHILS, GOBLET CELLS, AND SUBMUCOSAL GLAND CELLS IN NPS. PERCENTAGES OF CD8+ T CELLS AND CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ REGULATORY T CELLS (TREGS) WERE EVALUATED USING FLOW CYTOMETRY.

WE AIMED TO EVALUATE IF GREATER ANTIBIOTIC USE PRIOR TO SINUS SURGERY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENCES IN SURGICAL OUTCOMES. METHODS: ADULT CRS PATIENTS ENROLLED IN A PROSPECTIVE, MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL, OBSERVATIONAL COHORT STUDY WERE ASKED TO RECALL SYSTEMIC ANTIBIOTIC USE IN THE 90 DAYS PRIOR TO ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS). ANTIBIOTIC USE WAS EXAMINED IN RELATION TO DEMOGRAPHICS, DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS, AND OUTCOMES. RESULTS: DATA WERE COLLECTED FOR 271 STUDY PARTICIPANTS FOLLOWED FOR A MEAN OF 14.9 [± 5.1] MONTHS ACROSS FOUR INSTITUTIONS, WITH A MEAN PREOPERATIVE ANTIBIOTIC USE OF 27.8 [± 22.7] DAYS OUT OF THE 90 PRECEDING ESS. AFTER ESS, SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT (P < 0.001) WAS REPORTED FOR PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME MEASURES AND ENDOSCOPY SCORES FOR THE OVERALL COHORT. NO BIVARIATE CORRELATION BETWEEN PREOPERATIVE ANTIBIOTIC USE AND DEGREE OF BENEFIT IN OBJECTIVE CLINICAL MEASURES (ENDOSCOPY, BRIEF SMELL IDENTIFICATION TEST) WAS SEEN. INCREASED PREOPERATIVE ANTIBIOTIC USE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LESS IMPROVEMENT IN 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AND ITS RHINOLOGIC SUBDOMAIN AFTER ESS. PREVALENCE OF ACHIEVING A MINIMAL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE IN OVERALL SNOT-22 SYMPTOM SCORES WAS LOWER IN THOSE USING MORE PREOPERATIVE ANTIBIOTICS, ALTHOUGH STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE WAS NOT REACHED WHEN ADJUSTING FOR INDEPENDENT COVARIATES IN MULTIVARIATE MODELING. CONCLUSION: HIGHER AMOUNTS OF PREVIOUS ANTIBIOTIC USE DO NOT APPEAR TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER ESS OUTCOMES. SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ANTIBIOTIC USE AS PART OF CRS-APPROPRIATE MEDICAL THERAPY PRIOR TO ESS REQUIRE FURTHER STUDY, PARTICULARLY GIVEN CONCERNS FOR ANTIBIOTIC OVERUSE AND IMPLICATIONS FOR IMPROVING OUTCOMES IN THE MODERN HEALTHCARE ERA.

STRUCTURED HISTOPATHOLOGIC REPORTING HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IDENTIFY SALIENT HISTOLOGIC MARKERS TO DIFFERENTIATE SUBTYPES AND PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC MECHANISMS IN CRS. METHODS: A STRUCTURED HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT OF 13 VARIABLES WAS PROSPECTIVELY EMPLOYED TO ANALYZE ETHMOID SINUS TISSUE REMOVED DURING ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY FOR 99 PATIENTS, INCLUDING 43 CRSSNP AND 56 CRSWNP. THESE VARIABLES WERE COMPARED IN ASSOCIATION WITH PRESENCE OF NASAL POLYPS, RADIOGRAPHIC COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SCORES (LUND-MACKAY SCORE [LMS]), SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS SCORES (SNOT-22), DURATION OF CRS, COMORBID ASTHMA, AND ATOPY. RESULTS: OVERALL INFLAMMATION DID NOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN CRSSNP AND CRSWNP (P < 0.26). COMPARED TO CRSSNP, CRSWNP HAD STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN BASEMENT MEMBRANE THICKENING (76.8% VS 48.8%, P < 0.004), SUBEPITHELIAL EDEMA (19.6% VS 2.3%, P < 0.01), FIBROSIS (58.9% VS 27.9%, P < 0.002), HYPERPLASTIC/PAPILLARY CHANGES (12.5% VS 0.0%, P < 0.016), EOSINOPHILIA (41.1% VS 18.6%, P < 0.047), AND EOSINOPHILIC AGGREGATES (30.4% VS 11.6%, P < 0.022). HIGHER LMS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED EOSINOPHILIA (P < 0.001), EOSINOPHIL AGGREGATES (P < 0.000), INFLAMMATION (P < 0.023), BASEMENT MEMBRANE THICKENING (P < 0.037), HYPERPLASTIC/PAPILLARY CHANGES (P < 0.040) AND FIBROSIS (P < 0.000). SNOT-22 SCORES WERE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH ANY HISTOLOGIC PARAMETERS. CONCLUSION: SIGNIFICANT HISTOPATHOLOGIC DIFFERENCES WERE EVIDENT IN PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP AND CRSSNP. NO SINGLE FEATURE RELIABLY DIFFERENTIATED BETWEEN THE 2 SUBTYPES, UNDERSCORING THE HETEROGENEITY OF CRS AND LIMITATION OF THIS PHENOTYPIC CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM. EOSINOPHILIC AGGREGATES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE DISEASE, POSSIBLY SIGNIFYING A UNIQUE SUBTYPE.

HOWEVER, THE ROLE OF CONS IN CRS REMAINS CONTROVERSIAL. WE AIMED TO DETERMINE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN POSITIVE CONS CULTURE AT FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (FESS) AND CRS SEVERITY. METHODS: ADULT CRS PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT FESS BETWEEN OCTOBER 1, 2007 TO DECEMBER 31, 2011 WERE RECRUITED. PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS, DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS, MEDICATION USE, LUND-MACKAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) SCORES, AND 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE BEFORE FESS. INTRAOPERATIVE CULTURES WERE OBTAINED IN A STANDARD MANNER. PATIENTS WERE PLACED INTO 2 GROUPS BASED ON CULTURE FINDINGS: PATIENTS WITH CONS AS THE SOLE POSITIVE CULTURE RESULT AND PATIENTS WITH ALL OTHER POSITIVE CULTURE RESULTS, INCLUDING CONS, AS PART OF A POLYMICROBIAL CULTURE. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 376 CRS PATIENTS MET THE CRITERIA; 106 PATIENTS (28%) HAD CONS AS THEIR ONLY ISOLATE, 260 (69%) HAD OTHER POSITIVE CULTURES, AND 10 (3%) HAD NO BACTERIAL GROWTH. COMPARED TO PATIENTS WITH OTHER POSITIVE CULTURES, PATIENTS WITH THE SOLE RESULT OF CONS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS LIKELY TO HAVE A HISTORY OF FESS (52% VS 65%, P = 0.019), NASAL POLYPS (50% VS 65%, P = 0.006), AND HAD A BETTER LUND-MACKAY CT SCORE (11.95 VS 14.18, P = 0.020). AFTER ADJUSTING FOR ALL FACTORS IN THE MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL, CONS AS THE SOLE POSITIVE CULTURE RESULT WAS INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING NO HISTORY OF FESS (ODDS RATIO [OR] = 0.45; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], 0.22 TO 0.94; P = 0.034). CONCLUSION: POSITIVE INTRAOPERATIVE CONS CULTURES ALONE DO NOT RESULT IN INCREASED CRS DISEASE BURDEN BY OBJECTIVE OR SUBJECTIVE MEASURES AS COMPARED TO PATIENTS WITH OTHER BACTERIAL OR POLYMICROBIAL CULTURE ISOLATES.","DEPARTMENT OF BIOSTATISTICS AND EPIDEMIOLOGY, CENTER FOR CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND BIOSTATISTICS, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, PERELMAN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, PHILADELPHIA, PA.;",NA,"© 2014 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2014/11/05 06:00","20151123","20141103",2015,"2014/11/05 06:00",NA,NA,"K24 AI080942/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/UNITED STATES","3",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (PRINT) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.21439 [DOI]","20211021","2015/12/15 06:00","NIHMS630467",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","204-13",NA,"PMC4352125",NA,"25367456","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2015 MAR;5(3):204-13.

THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN POLYPOID CHANGE OF ANTERIOR FREE BORDER OF MIDDLE TURBINATE AND RATE OF RELAPSE IN PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP. METHODS: A CONTROLLED PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY WAS PERFORMED. SEVENTY-SEVEN ADULT PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP IN WHOM THEIR MT POLYPOID CHANGE WAS PROVED AND 77 PATIENTS WITHOUT MT POLYPOID CHANGE WERE RECRUITED.

POLYP RELAPSE, LUND KENNEDY SCORES AND SNOT-22 SCORES WERE DOCUMENTED. RESULTS: THE RELAPSE RATE IN PATIENTS WITH MT POLYPOID CHANGE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (37.14 VS. 20.58, P VALUE = 0.03).

THE EOSINOPHILIC NASAL POLYPOSIS (ENP) REPRESENTS MOST OF THE CASES OF NASAL POLYPOSIS (85-90%) AND BELONGS TO THE GROUP OF CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS. IT IS A CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE THAT IMPACTS THE QOL OF PATIENTS, NOT ONLY CAUSING LOCALIZED SYMPTOMS, BUT ALSO RESULTING IN A GENERAL MALAISE. THE STANDARD TREATMENTS (CORTICOSTEROIDS AND NASAL ENDOSCOPIC SURGERY) LEAD TO PARTIAL CONTROL OF SYMPTOMS, BUT RELAPSES ARE FREQUENT. MACROLIDE ACTING AS AN IMMUNOMODULATOR IS A PROMISING TOOL FOR MORE EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF THIS DISEASE. STUDIES ARE STILL LACKING TO ASSESS THE REAL IMPACT ON THE QOL IN PATIENTS TREATED WITH MACROLIDES. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE IMPROVEMENT OF QL, EVALUATED USING SNOT-22, IN PATIENTS WITH PNSE TREATED WITH IMMUNOMODULATORY DOSE AZITHROMYCIN. METHODS: THIS IS A PAIRED EXPERIMENTAL STUDY IN PATIENTS WITH ENP. COMPARISON OF PRE-TREATMENT AND POST-TREATMENT WITH AZITHROMYCIN WAS PERFORMED. PATIENTS COMPLETED THE SNOT-22 QUESTIONNAIRE BEFORE THE START OF TREATMENT AND RETURNED FOR EVALUATION AFTER EIGHT WEEKS OF TREATMENT. AZITHROMYCIN WAS PRESCRIBED AT A DOSE OF 500 MG, ORALLY, THREE TIMES A WEEK, FOR 8 WEEKS. RESULTS: SNOT-22 SCORE DECREASED 20.3 POINTS ON AVERAGE. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE SNOT-22 (DIFFERENCE GREATER THAN 14 POINTS) IN 19 PATIENTS (57.6%). THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN IMPROVEMENT IN SNOT IN SUBGROUPS WITH OR WITHOUT ASTHMA/ASPIRIN INTOLERANCE. CONCLUSION: AZITHROMYCIN RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OF QOL, ASSESSED BY SNOT-22, IN THE STUDIED POPULATION.","DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY AND OPHTHALMOLOGY, UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE MINAS GERAIS (UFMG), BELO HORIZONTE, MG, BRAZIL.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: SIMASMED@GMAIL.;COM.; DEPARTMENT OF OPHTHALMOLOGY, OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY AND PHONOAUDIOLOGY, UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE MINAS GERAIS (UFMG), BELO HORIZONTE, MG, BRAZIL.; DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL PATHOLOGY, UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE MINAS GERAIS (UFMG), BELO HORIZONTE, MG, BRAZIL.; MEDICINE SCHOOL, UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE MINAS GERAIS (UFMG), BELO HORIZONTE, MG, BRAZIL.; INSTITUTO TECNOLÓGICO DE AERONÁUTICA, UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE MINAS GERAIS (UFMG), BELO HORIZONTE, MG, BRAZIL.; DEPARTMENT OF OPHTHALMOLOGY, OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY AND PHONOAUDIOLOGY, UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE MINAS GERAIS (UFMG), BELO HORIZONTE, MG, BRAZIL.; DEPARTMENT OF OPHTHALMOLOGY, OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY AND PHONOAUDIOLOGY, UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE MINAS GERAIS (UFMG), BELO HORIZONTE, MG, BRAZIL.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT © 2015 ASSOCIAÇÃO BRASILEIRA DE OTORRINOLARINGOLOGIA E CIRURGIA CÉRVICO-FACIAL.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO MEASURE NNO CHANGES IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS) FOR CRS AND TO EXPLORE ITS RELATIONSHIP TO CLINICAL MEASURES OF SINUS MUCOSAL HEALTH POSTOPERATIVELY. METHODS: THIS WAS A PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF CRS PATIENTS UNDERGOING ESS. PATIENTS HAD THE FOLLOWING MEASUREMENTS AT BASELINE AND AT 1 AND 6 MONTHS POST-ESS: NNO LEVELS, LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPY SCORE (LKES), AND 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORE. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED USING GRAPHPAD PRISM 6. RESULTS: THIRTY-NINE PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED, OF THESE 84.6% HAD CRS WITH NASAL POLYPS. BASELINE LUND-MACKAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) SCORE WAS 16.9 ± 5.1. THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN NNO LEVELS FROM BASELINE TO 1 MONTH AND 6 MONTHS POSTOPERATIVELY (P < 0.0001). THE SNOT-22 AND LKES FOLLOWED A SIMILAR TREND WITH A SIGNIFICANT AND SUSTAINED IMPROVEMENT AT 1 MONTH AND 6 MONTHS POST-ESS (P < 0.0001). SUBGROUP ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT CHANGES IN NNO WERE DRIVEN BY THE POLYP COHORT BECAUSE NONPOLYP PATIENTS HAD NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THEIR NNO POSTOPERATIVELY. NO CORRELATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN NNO LEVELS AND SNOT-22. HOWEVER, A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CORRELATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN NNO AND LKES (P < 0.0001), SUGGESTING HEALTHIER SINUS MUCOSA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER NNO LEVELS. CONCLUSION: THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO SHOW THAT NNO LEVELS MAY BE A MARKER OF SINUS MUCOSAL HEALTH FOLLOWING ESS IN PATIENTS WITH POLYPS. THIS HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR NNO IN ITS POTENTIAL ETIOLOGIC ROLE IN MEDIATING ONGOING SINUS INFLAMMATION.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, ST.; MICHAEL'S HOSPITAL, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO, TORONTO, ONTARIO, CANADA.; THE KEENAN RESEARCH CENTRE IN THE LI KA SHING KNOWLEDGE INSTITUTE OF ST.; MICHAEL'S HOSPITAL, TORONTO, ONTARIO, CANADA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, ST.; MICHAEL'S HOSPITAL, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO, TORONTO, ONTARIO, CANADA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, ST.; MICHAEL'S HOSPITAL, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO, TORONTO, ONTARIO, CANADA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, ST.; MICHAEL'S HOSPITAL, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO, TORONTO, ONTARIO, CANADA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, ST.; MICHAEL'S HOSPITAL, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO, TORONTO, ONTARIO, CANADA.; THE KEENAN RESEARCH CENTRE IN THE LI KA SHING KNOWLEDGE INSTITUTE OF ST.; MICHAEL'S HOSPITAL, TORONTO, ONTARIO, CANADA.; DIVISION OF RESPIROLOGY, DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, ST.; MICHAEL'S HOSPITAL, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO, TORONTO, ONTARIO, CANADA.;",NA,"© 2015 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2015/07/18 06:00","20160815","20150717",2015,"2015/07/18 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"10",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.21598 [DOI]","20151016","2016/08/16 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","894-9","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"26184956","PPUBLISH","0 (BIOMARKERS) 31C4KY9ESH (NITRIC OXIDE)","IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2015 OCT;5(10):894-9.

DEFINING SPECIFIC SYMPTOMS THAT CAN BE RELIABLY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS DISORDER WOULD BE ESSENTIAL TO IDENTIFYING POSSIBLE ENS PATIENTS. WE SOUGHT TO VALIDATE AN ENS-SPECIFIC, 6-ITEM QUESTIONNAIRE AS AN ADJUNCT TO THE STANDARD SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST 22 (SNOT-22) QUESTIONNAIRE TO DISCRIMINATE PATIENTS SUSPECTED OF HAVING ENS. METHODS: THE EMPTY NOSE SYNDROME 6-ITEM QUESTIONNAIRE (ENS6Q) PAIRED 6 COMMON ENS SYMPTOMS (NASAL SUFFOCATION, NASAL BURNING, NASAL OPENNESS, CRUSTING, DRYNESS, AND IMPAIRED AIR SENSATION THROUGH NASAL CAVITIES) WITH TESTING ON 75 PATIENTS DIVIDED IN 3 PATIENT COHORTS: ENS; CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITHOUT POLYPOSIS; AND HEALTHY CONTROLS. PARTICIPANTS ANSWERED 2 ROUNDS OF BOTH THE SNOT-22 QUESTIONNAIRE AND ENS6Q WITHIN 48 HOURS OF EACH OTHER. NO CHANGES IN TREATMENTS OCCURRED IN THE TEST INTERVAL BETWEEN QUESTIONNAIRES. INTERNAL CONSISTENCY, TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY, VALIDITY, AND AREA UNDER THE CURVE WERE ASSESSED TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN PATIENT COHORTS USING THE 2 INSTRUMENTS. RESULTS: WE FOUND HIGH INTERNAL CONSISTENCY FOR ENS6Q AND SNOT-22 QUESTIONNAIRE AT 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.95) AND 0.94 (95% CI, 0.94-0.96), RESPECTIVELY. THE TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY BETWEEN TIMEPOINTS FOR ENS6Q TESTING WAS 0.969. THE ENS6Q STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY DISCRIMINATED BETWEEN ENS AND CONTROL PATIENTS AND BETWEEN ENS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITHOUT POLYPOSIS (CRSSNP) PATIENTS, WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CRSSNP AND CONTROLS. THE AREA-UNDER-THE-CURVE (AUC) THRESHOLD SCORE COMPARISON FURTHER SUPPORTED THE ABILITY OF THE ENS6Q TO DIFFERENTIATE ENS FROM CRSSNP PATIENTS. CONCLUSION: THE ENS6Q IS THE FIRST VALIDATED, SPECIFIC, ADJUNCT QUESTIONNAIRE TO THE SNOT-22 TO MORE RELIABLY IDENTIFY PATIENTS SUSPECTED OF DEVELOPING ENS.","DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, STANFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, PALO ALTO, CA.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, STANFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, PALO ALTO, CA.; SYDNEY MEDICAL PROGRAM, UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY, SYDNEY, NSW, AUSTRALIA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, BEIJING TONGREN HOSPITAL, CAPITAL MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, BEIJING, CHINA.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, STANFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, PALO ALTO, CA.;",NA,"© 2016 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2016/08/25 06:00","20171120","20160824",2017,"2016/08/25 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"1",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.21842 [DOI]","20171219","2017/11/29 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","64-71","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"27557473","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2017 JAN;7(1):64-71.

FAILURE RATES OF STANDARD ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY IN THESE PATIENTS ARE REPORTED TO BE AS HIGH AS 90%. WE REVIEW THE OUTCOMES FOR OUR COHORT OF AERD PATIENTS UNDERGOING ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY AND ENDOSCOPIC MODIFIED LOTHROP PROCEDURE (EMLP). METHODS: DATA WAS COLLECTED PROSPECTIVELY BETWEEN JANUARY 2001 AND DECEMBER 2013. INFORMATION INCLUDING DEMOGRAPHICS, ASTHMA STATUS, ASPIRIN SENSITIVITY, 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), LUND-MACKAY SCORES, AND ENDOSCOPIC OSTIUM ASSESSMENT WERE COLLECTED FOR UP TO 5 YEARS. MINIMUM FOLLOW-UP WAS 6 MONTHS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 31 AERD PATIENTS UNDERWENT COMPLETE SPHENOETHMOIDECTOMY, MAXILLARY ANTROSTOMY AND EMLP DURING THE STUDY PERIOD WITH AN AVERAGE FOLLOW-UP OF 36 MONTHS. POLYP RECURRENCE WAS SEEN IN A TOTAL OF 18 PATIENTS (58%). SEVEN PATIENTS REQUIRED REVISION EMLP FOLLOWING INITIAL SURGERY DEMONSTRATING A FAILURE RATE OF 22.5%. AERD PATIENTS HAD A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASED RISK OF BOTH NASAL POLYPS RECURRENCE AND NEED FOR REVISION SURGERY. REVISION EMLP WAS NEEDED DUE TO RECURRENCE OF NASAL POLYPS IN 6 CASES AND FRONTAL OSTIUM STENOSIS IN A SINGLE CASE. TIME TO REVISION EMLP WAS SIMILAR BETWEEN THE GROUPS. CONCLUSION: COMPLETE SPHENOETHMOIDECTOMY, MAXILLARY ANTROSTOMY, AND EMLP IS SUCCESSFUL IN A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF PATIENTS WITH AERD AND CRSWNP.

METHODS: PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY FOR CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WERE PROSPECTIVELY ENROLLED FROM A TERTIARY RHINOLOGY PRACTICE. FOURTEEN ENDOSCOPIC NASAL EXAMINATIONS WERE RECORDED USING DIGITAL VIDEO CAPTURE SOFTWARE. EACH PATIENT ALSO UNDERWENT COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) AND COMPLETED THE SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). BLINDED REVIEW OF INFLAMMATORY AND ANATOMIC FINDINGS FOR EACH VIDEO WAS INDEPENDENTLY PERFORMED BY 5 ACADEMIC RHINOLOGISTS AT SEPARATE INSTITUTIONS. COMPARISONS WERE PERFORMED USING THE UNWEIGHTED FLEISS' KAPPA STATISTIC (K(F) ) AND THE PREVALENCE- AND BIAS-ADJUSTED KAPPA (PABAK). RESULTS: THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS BETWEEN AGE, LUND-MACKAY SCORE, OR SNOT-22 SCORE. INTERRATER AGREEMENT WAS VARIABLE ACROSS THE CHARACTERISTICS STUDIED. MEAN PABAK WAS EXCELLENT FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF POLYPS (K(F) = 0.886); MODERATE FOR THE ASSESSMENTS OF MIDDLE TURBINATE (MT) INTEGRITY (K(F) = 0.543), MT POSITION (K(F) = 0.443), MAXILLARY SINUS PATENCY (K(F) = 0.593), AND ETHMOID SINUS PATENCY (K(F) = 0.429); FAIR FOR DISCHARGE (K(F) = 0.314), SYNECHIAE (K(F) = 0.257), AND MIDDLE MEATUS PATENCY (K(F) = 0.229); AND POOR FOR MT MUCOSAL CHANGES (K(F) = 0.148) AND UNCINATE PROCESS (K(F) = 0.126).

LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THIS DISEASE. THE AIMS OF THE STUDY WERE TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENCES IN SOCIO-ECONOMIC VARIABLES AND QUALITY OF LIFE BETWEEN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS AND HEALTHY CONTROLS, TO IDENTIFY ANY SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN CRS AND OTHER MEDICAL CO-MORBIDITIES, PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE OR ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE AND TO EXPLORE THE EXPERIENCE OF CRS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CRS SUFFERERS. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED FROM ENT CLINICS FROM 30 CENTRES ACROSS THE UK. THEY COMPLETED A STUDY-SPECIFIC QUESTIONNAIRE CONSIDERING ENVIRONMENTAL, MEDICAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS, AND SF-36 AND SNOT-22 SCORES. ALL PARTICIPANTS WITH CRS WERE DIAGNOSED BY A CLINICIAN AND CATEGORISED AS HAVING CRS (WITH POLYPOSIS, WITHOUT POLYPOSIS OR ALLERGIC FUNGAL RHINOSINUSITIS (AFRS)). CONTROLS INCLUDED FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF THOSE ATTENDING ENT OUTPATIENT CLINICS AND HOSPITAL STAFF WHO HAD NO DIAGNOSIS OF NOSE OR SINUS PROBLEMS AND HAD NOT BEEN ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL IN THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 1470 STUDY PARTICIPANTS (1249 PATIENTS AND 221 CONTROLS) WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS. HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE SEEN IN GENERIC AND DISEASE-SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES BETWEEN CRS SUFFERERS AND CONTROLS; MEAN SNOT-22 SCORE 45.0 FOR CRS COMPARED WITH 12.1 AMONGST CONTROLS. THERE WERE NO CLEAR DIFFERENCES IN SOCIOECONOMIC VARIABLES INCLUDING SOCIAL CLASS, INDEX OF MULTIPLE DEPRIVATION AND EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT BETWEEN CASES AND CONTROLS. COMMON COMORBIDITIES WITH A CLEAR ASSOCIATION INCLUDED RESPIRATORY AND PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS, WITH A HIGHER FREQUENCY OF REPORTED UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS. CONCLUSIONS: CRS IS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT IN QUALITY OF LIFE AND WITH CERTAIN MEDICAL CO-MORBIDITIES. IN CONTRAST TO OTHER COMMON ENT DISORDERS, NO SOCIOECONOMIC DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND BETWEEN PATIENTS AND CONTROLS IN THIS STUDY.","NORWICH MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA, NORWICH, UK.; NORWICH MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA, NORWICH, UK.; ENT DEPARTMENT, GUYS AND ST THOMAS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST, LONDON, UK.; NORWICH MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA, NORWICH, UK.; ENT DEPARTMENT, DARLINGTON MEMORIAL HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST, DARLINGTON, UK.; ENT DEPARTMENT, ROYAL SURREY COUNTY HOSPITAL, SURREY, UK.; ENT DEPARTMENT, HEART OF ENGLAND NHS FOUNDATION TRUST, BIRMINGHAM, UK.; ENT DEPARTMENT, IPSWICH HOSPITAL NHS TRUST, IPSWICH, UK.; ENT DEPARTMENT, BETSI CADWALADR UNIVERSITY HEALTH BOARD WREXHAM MAELOR HOSPITAL, WREXHAM, UK.;",NA,NA,NA,"CRES GROUP",NA,"2016/05/13 06:00","20160721",NA,2016,"2016/05/14 06:00",NA,"PHILPOTT, CARL ERSKINE, SALLY PHILPOTT, CARL CLARK, ALLAN HOPKINS, CLAIRE ROBERTSON, ALASDAIR AHMED, SHAHZADA KARA, NAVEED CARRIE, SEAN SUNKARANENI, VISHNU RAY, JAYDIP ANARI, SHAHRAM JERVIS, PAUL PANESAAR, JAAN FARBOUD, AMIR KUMAR, NIRMAL CATHCART, RUSSELL ALMEYDA, ROBERT KHALIL, HISHAM PRINSLEY, PETER MANSELL, NICOLAS SALAM, MAHMOUD HOBSON, JONATHAN WOODS, JANE COOMBES, EMMA",NA,"2","PHILPOTT C ERSKINE S PHILPOTT C CLARK A HOPKINS C ROBERTSON A AHMED S KARA N CARRIE S SUNKARANENI V RAY J ANARI S JERVIS P PANESAAR J FARBOUD A KUMAR N CATHCART R ALMEYDA R KHALIL H PRINSLEY P MANSELL N SALAM M HOBSON J WOODS J COOMBES E","0300-0729 (PRINT) 0300-0729 (LINKING)","0347242","RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.4193/RHINO15.272 [DOI]","20211203","2016/07/22 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","134-40","NETHERLANDS",NA,NA,"27172454","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"RHINOLOGY. 2016 JUN;54(2):134-40.

TREATMENT OF THIS CONDITION IS CHALLENGING AND MAY INCLUDE TOPICAL/SYSTEMIC STEROIDS, ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY, AND/OR ASPIRIN DESENSITIZATION. STUDY DESIGN: A PROSPECTIVE CROSSOVER PILOT STUDY (N = 10) WAS CONDUCTED IN WHICH PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO EITHER OF 2 GROUPS WITH 6 WEEKS OF REGULAR DIET (R) OR 6 WEEKS OF A LOW SALICYLATE DIET (LS). SETTING: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN A TERTIARY OTOLARYNGOLOGY CLINIC. SUBJECTS: PATIENTS WITH AERD WERE ENROLLED IN THE STUDY. METHODS: SUBJECTIVE (SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 [SNOT-22], NASAL SINUS SYMPTOM SCALE [NSSS], AND THE ASTHMA CONTROL QUESTIONNAIRE-7 [ACQ-7]) AND OBJECTIVE OUTCOME INSTRUMENTS (PERI-OPERATIVE SINUS EVALUATION [POSE] AND LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPIC SCORE [LKES]) WERE USED TO EVALUATE PATIENTS AT BASELINE, 6 WEEKS (AT CROSSOVER), AND 12 WEEKS. RESULTS: WILCOXON RANK SUM TESTS DEMONSTRATED THAT PATIENTS ON THE LOW SALICYLATE DIET HAD IMPROVED SCORES COMPARED TO THEIR REGULAR DIET WHEN EVALUATED BY 4 OF THE 5 OUTCOME MEASURES (SNOT-22 PLS = 0.0059, NSSS PLS = 0.0195, LKES PLS = 0.0039, POSE PLS = 0.005). CONCLUSION: RESULTS OF THE PILOT STUDY INDICATE THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF A LOW SALICYLATE DIET IMPROVES THE NASAL SYMPTOMS AND NASAL ENDOSCOPY FINDINGS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH AERD.

FURTHERMORE, OBJECTIVE OLFACTORY TESTING CAN BE TIME CONSUMING, SO WE SOUGHT TO DETERMINE IF PATIENT-REPORTED OLFACTORY QOL CAN BE USED AS SCREENING TOOL FOR OLFACTORY DYSFUNCTION. METHODS: OLFACTORY DYSFUNCTION WAS EVALUATED IN 109 PATIENTS WITH CRS USING THE QUESTIONNAIRE OF OLFACTORY DISORDERS-NEGATIVE STATEMENTS (QOD-NS) AND THE SNIFFIN' STICKS TEST, ASSESSING FOR OLFACTORY THRESHOLD, DISCRIMINATION, IDENTIFICATION, AND OVERALL COMPOSITE SCORES (TDI; COMPOSITE SCORE OF THRESHOLD, DISCRIMINATION, AND IDENTIFICATION). REGRESSION ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED TO CORRELATE OLFACTORY METRICS AND PATIENT AND DISEASE-SPECIFIC FACTORS WITH QOD-NS SCORES. OPTIMAL QOD-NS SCORES TO CLASSIFY PATIENTS BASED UPON OBJECTIVE OLFACTORY FUNCTION WERE ESTABLISHED. RESULTS: BIVARIATE AND MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION ANALYSES OF QOD-NS AND CRS-ASSOCIATED COMORBIDITIES, OBJECTIVE MEASURES OF DISEASE, DEMOGRAPHICS, AND CRS-SPECIFIC QOL WERE PERFORMED. NON-WHITE RACE, DEPRESSION, AND WORSE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES CORRELATED WITH WORSE QOD-NS SCORES (P < 0.005). WORSE TDI SCORES CORRELATED WITH WORSE QOD-NS SCORES, AND DISCRIMINATION HAD THE STRONGEST CORRELATION (P < 0.001). MEAN ± STANDARD DEVIATION (SD) QOD-NS SCORES FOR NORMOSMIA, HYPOSMIA, AND ANOSMIA WERE 44 ± 7.2, 35.7 ± 12.8, AND 31.6 ± 10.7, RESPECTIVELY.

ENDOSCOPIC NASAL POLYPECTOMY UNDER LOCAL ANAESTHESIA OFFERS INSTANT RELIEF IN SELECTED PATIENTS WITH OBSTRUCTIVE CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITH NASAL POLYPS. WE AIMED TO ANALYSE PATIENT TOLERABILITY DURING THE PROCEDURE WHILE MEASURING ITS EFFECTIVENESS. METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT IN-OFFICE MICRODEBRIDER-ASSISTED POLYPECTOMY UNDER LOCAL ANAESTHETIC FROM SEPTEMBER 2018 TO NOVEMBER 2019 IN A SPANISH TERTIARY HOSPITAL WAS PERFORMED. THE TOLERABILITY WAS MEASURED BY MONITORING VITAL SIGNS DURING THE PROCEDURE AND USING A VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE POSTERIORLY. THE EFFECTIVENESS WAS CALCULATED THROUGH PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES (SNOT-22) AND ENDOSCOPIC EVALUATION 1 AND 6 MONTHS FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: FORTY-FOUR PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED, WITH A MEAN AGE OF 60.7 YEARS. THE MEAN VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE SCORE WAS 2.76 OUT OF 10 POINTS. VITAL SIGNS WERE STEADY OVERALL, WITH A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION (P < 0.001) IN SYSTOLIC PRESSURE DURING THE PROCEDURE. PRESYNCOPE AND EPISTAXIS WERE AMONG THE FEW MILD COMPLICATIONS. HOWEVER, WE REGISTERED ONE MAJOR COMPLICATION THAT REQUIRED INTENSIVE CARE ADMISSION. THERE WAS A 64% REDUCTION IN THE SNOT-22 SCORE IN THE FIRST MONTH, WITH A MAINTAINED EFFECT AFTER 6 MONTHS. PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA AND A HIGHER POLYP LOAD WERE THE SUBGROUPS THAT REQUIRED MORE TIME TO ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. CONCLUSIONS: IN-OFFICE POLYPECTOMY IS A VERY EFFECTIVE TECHNIQUE THAT ALLEVIATES OBSTRUCTIVE SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS WITH NASAL POLYPOSIS, AND IT IS GENERALLY SAFE AND WELL TOLERATED WHEN PERFORMED BY AN EXPERT. HOWEVER, RHINOLOGISTS MUST BE AWARE OF POTENTIALLY SEVERE COMPLICATIONS.","OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY DEPARTMENT, MARQUÉS VALDECILLA UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, AVENIDA VALDECILLA S/N, CANTABRIA, SPAIN.; JAIMEVIERAARTILES@GMAIL.;COM.; OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY DEPARTMENT, MARQUÉS VALDECILLA UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, AVENIDA VALDECILLA S/N, CANTABRIA, SPAIN.; OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY DEPARTMENT, MARQUÉS VALDECILLA UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, AVENIDA VALDECILLA S/N, CANTABRIA, SPAIN.; OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY DEPARTMENT, MARQUÉS VALDECILLA UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, AVENIDA VALDECILLA S/N, CANTABRIA, SPAIN.; OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY DEPARTMENT, MARQUÉS VALDECILLA UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, AVENIDA VALDECILLA S/N, CANTABRIA, SPAIN.; OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY DEPARTMENT, MARQUÉS VALDECILLA UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, AVENIDA VALDECILLA S/N, CANTABRIA, SPAIN.;","ORCID: 0000-0002-5651-2289 ORCID: 0000-0001-5440-7330 ORCID: 0000-0002-3945-9420 ORCID: 0000-0002-4407-287X ORCID: 0000-0002-4322-6638 ORCID: 0000-0002-5802-0157",NA,NA,NA,"ALL AUTHORS DECLARE THERE IS NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN THIS PUBLICATION","2020/07/16 06:00","20210326","20200714",2020,"2020/07/16 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"12",NA,"1434-4726 (ELECTRONIC) 0937-4477 (PRINT) 0937-4477 (LINKING)","9002937","EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY : OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN FEDERATION OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGICAL SOCIETIES (EUFOS) : AFFILIATED WITH THE GERMAN SOCIETY FOR OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY","ENG","10.1007/S00405-020-06196-0 [DOI]","20210326","2021/03/27 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","3341-3348",NA,"PMC7359762",NA,"32666295","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"EUR ARCH OTORHINOLARYNGOL. 2020 DEC;277(12):3341-3348.

CURRENTLY, OUTCOMES FOLLOWING ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS) FOR MEDICALLY RECALCITRANT CRS ARE INFERRED FROM OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS WITH BILATERAL DISEASE. THIS STUDY COMPARES OUTCOMES OF ESS BETWEEN PATIENTS WITH UNILATERAL AND BILATERAL DISEASE. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH CRSSNP WHO FAILED APPROPRIATE MEDICAL THERAPY AND ELECTED ESS WERE ENROLLED BETWEEN 2011 AND 2015. PATIENTS WERE DICHOTOMIZED ACCORDING TO RADIOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE OF UNILATERAL DISEASE (LUND-MACKAY [LM] SCORE = 0 FOR 1 SIDE) OR BILATERAL DISEASE (LM = 1 FOR BOTH SIDES). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME OF INTEREST WAS THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), WITH SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDING THE BRIEF SMELL IDENTIFICATION TEST (BSIT) AND THE LUND-KENNEDY (LK) ENDOSCOPY STAGING SYSTEM. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 190 PATIENTS MET INCLUSION CRITERIA CONSISTING OF 19 WITH UNILATERAL (10%) AND 171 WITH BILATERAL CRSSNP (90%). BOTH GROUPS WERE SIMILAR ACROSS ALL PREOPERATIVE DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS, SNOT-22, AND BSIT SCORES. POSTOPERATIVELY, PATIENTS WITH BILATERAL DISEASE REPORTED GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN MEAN SNOT-22 SCORES COMPARED TO UNILATERAL DISEASE, BUT THIS DIFFERENCE WAS NOT STATISTICALLY OR CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT (-24.3 ± 21.1 VS -21.5 ± 24.0, P = 0.582). MEAN LK SCORES IMPROVED FOR PATIENTS WITH BILATERAL DISEASE BUT NOT UNILATERAL DISEASE, WITHOUT A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS (-2.0 ± 3.5 VS -0.4 ± 2.4, P = 0.090).

HOWEVER, THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN DIABETES AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS) HAS NOT BEEN WELL STUDIED. WE SOUGHT TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF DM ON CRS CULTURE RESULTS AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AFTER FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (FESS). METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. ADULT CRS PATIENTS UNDERGOING FESS WERE RECRUITED FROM OCTOBER 1, 2007 TO DECEMBER 31, 2011. PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS, COMORBIDITIES, MEDICATION USE, AND LUND-MACKAY CT SCORES WERE COLLECTED PRIOR TO FESS. INTRAOPERATIVE CULTURE WAS OBTAINED. PREOPERATIVE AND 1-MONTH, 3-MONTH, AND 6-MONTH POSTOPERATIVE QOL WAS MEASURED BY SCORES ON THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). A MIXED EFFECTS MODEL WAS PERFORMED FOR ANALYSIS. RESULTS: AMONG THE 376 CRS PATIENTS INCLUDED, 19 PATIENTS (5.05%) HAD DM. COMPARED TO NON-DM PATIENTS, DM PATIENTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO HAVE PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA (26.32% VS 7.56%; P = 0.004) AND GRAM-NEGATIVE RODS (26.32% VS 8.96%; P = 0.013), BUT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE PREVALENCE OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS; DM PATIENTS WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO HAVE NASAL POLYPS AND GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE. ADDITIONALLY, DM PATIENTS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LESS IMPROVEMENT OF POSTOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORES FROM BASELINE TO 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP THAN NON-DM PATIENTS (ADJUSTED MEAN = 11.14, 95% CI (0.14, 22.15), P = 0.047) AFTER ADJUSTING FOR ALL THE OTHER RISK FACTORS FOR CRS. CONCLUSION: DM PATIENTS MAY BE PRONE TO GRAM-NEGATIVE BACTERIAL SINUS INFECTIONS, AND HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE SHORT-TERM POSTOPERATIVE QOL. SPECIAL POSTOPERATIVE CARE MAY NEED TO BE CONSIDERED IN CRS PATIENTS WITH DM.","DEPARTMENT OF BIOSTATISTICS AND EPIDEMIOLOGY, CENTER FOR CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND BIOSTATISTICS, PERELMAN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, PHILADELPHIA, PA.;",NA,"© 2014 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2014/01/14 06:00","20141113","20140110",2014,"2014/01/15 06:00",NA,NA,"K24 AI080942/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/UNITED STATES K24 AI080942/AI/NIAID/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/UNITED STATES","4",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (PRINT) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.21269 [DOI]","20211021","2014/11/14 06:00","NIHMS545836",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","315-20",NA,"PMC3975697",NA,"24415555","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2014 APR;4(4):315-20.

METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS PERFORMED. TWENTY-FIVE PATIENTS WITH CSS BELONGING TO A PATIENT SELF-HELP GROUP PARTICIPATED. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED MODE OF INITIAL PRESENTATION, TREATMENT, RHINOLOGIC SYMPTOMS, AND DISEASE-SPECIFIC QOL (SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST [SNOT-22] SCORES) AND COMPARISONS WERE MADE WITH GENERAL RHINOSINUSITIS AND OTHER NASALLY AFFECTED VASCULITIS PATIENTS (WEGENER'S GRANULOMATOSIS [WG]). RESULTS: OVERALL, 80% OF CSS PATIENTS HAD ACTIVE SINONASAL SYMPTOMS AT THE TIME OF THE STUDY. TWENTY-EIGHT PERCENT OF CSS PATIENTS REPORTED WORSENING OF THEIR NASAL SYMPTOMS AS THE MAIN EVENT LEADING TO THEIR DIAGNOSIS. FORTY-EIGHT PERCENT OF CSS PATIENTS HAD UNDERGONE NASAL SURGERY. NASAL SYMPTOMS THAT ARE OF PARTICULAR RELEVANCE TO THIS PATIENT GROUP ARE NASAL OBSTRUCTION (95%), RHINORRHEA (95%), ANOSMIA (90%), AND EXCESSIVE SNEEZING (80%).

DESPITE TOPICAL TREATMENT WITH INTRANASAL STEROIDS, ACUTE INFLAMMATORY EXACERBATIONS (AES) ARE COMMON AND ARE TYPICALLY TREATED WITH ORAL PREDNISONE, WHICH HAS SIGNIFICANT AND WELL-DOCUMENTED SIDE EFFECTS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CURRENT STUDY WAS TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE THE TOPICAL APPLICATION OF TRIAMCINOLONE ACETONIDE (80) IN CARBOXYMETHYLCELLULOSE (TA/CMC) FOAM FOR AES IN CRS/NP PATIENTS AFTER ESS. METHODS: CRS/NP PATIENTS MANAGED WITH ESS BY A SINGLE RHINOLOGIST OVER A 5-YEAR PERIOD WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. DATA WERE REVIEWED REGARDING DEMOGRAPHICS, NUMBER OF AES, REVISION SURGERY, 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOMES TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES, FREQUENCY OF ORAL PREDNISONE AND/OR TA/CMC, AND NOTABLE SIDE EFFECTS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 371 CRS/NP PATIENTS WERE TREATED WITH ESS OVER A 5-YEAR PERIOD. MEAN FOLLOW-UP WAS 49.3 WEEKS (RANGE, 2-249 WEEKS). DURING THIS TIME PERIOD, 130 PATIENTS (46 YEARS; RANGE, 28-48 YEARS) DEVELOPED A CUMULATIVE 267 AES. BEFORE INITIATING USE OF TA/CMC IN 2010, 66 AES WERE TREATED WITH PREDNISONE. SUBSEQUENTLY, 116 OF 201 AES WERE MANAGED WITH TA/CMC WITH A SEQUENTIAL DECREASE IN PREDNISONE USE OVER THE LAST 3 YEARS (77, 39, AND 32%).

OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE COSTAL CARTILAGE LATERAL CRURAL STRUT GRAFTS VS CEPHALIC CRURAL TURN-IN TO SUPPORT THE WEAK LATERAL CRUS IN PATIENTS WITH EVD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: IN THIS PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY, PATIENTS WITH CLINICALLY DIAGNOSED EVD WERE ASSESSED AT THE TERTIARY RHINOLOGIC CENTER AND UNDERWENT A COSTAL CARTILAGE UNDERLAY GRAFT TO THE LATERAL CRUS OR A CEPHALIC TURN-IN CRURALPLASTY. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: ASSESSMENT OF PATIENT BENEFIT WAS BASED ON 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AND NASAL OBSTRUCTION SYMPTOM EVALUATION SCALE (NOSE) SCORES. A LIKERT SCALE WAS ALSO USED TO ASSESS OVERALL FUNCTION AND COSMESIS. OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT INCLUDED POSTDECONGESTION NASAL PEAK INSPIRATORY FLOW, NASAL AIRWAY RESISTANCE, AND MINIMUM CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA. RESULTS: FORTY-ONE PATIENTS (MEAN [SD] 35.38 [12.73] YEARS OF AGE; 25 [61%] FEMALE) WERE ASSESSED. CEPHALIC TURN-IN MANEUVER WAS USED FOR 25 (61%) PATIENTS; COSTAL CARTILAGE LATERAL CRURAL STRUT GRAFTS, 16 (39%) PATIENTS. COSTAL CARTILAGE GRAFTS WERE USED IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING REVISION BUT OTHER BASELINE DATA WERE SIMILAR. FOLLOW-UP WAS MEAN 10.58 (7.52) MONTHS.

OBJECTIVE: TO EXPLORE THE EFFECT OF FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (FESS) ON THE TREATMENT OF BRONCHIECTASIS COMBINED WITH CHRONIC RHINO-SINUSITIS. METHODS: IN THIS STUDY, A TOTAL OF 161 CASES WITH BRONCHIECTASIS AND CHRONIC RHINO-SINUSITIS WERE DIVIDED INTO MEDICATION GROUP AND OPERATION GROUP ACCORDING TO THE THERAPEUTIC METHOD FOR CHRONIC RHINO-SINUSITIS SELECTED BY THEM. FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC RHINO-SINUSITIS, THE CASES IN THE OPERATION GROUP RECEIVED FESS, BUT IN THE MEDICATION GROUP CASES TOOK DRUGS ALONE. THE SCORE OF CLINICAL SYMPTOMS FOR BRONCHIECTASIS, FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN ONE SECOND (FEV1), SNOT-22 SCORE, AND LUND-MACKAY SCORE WERE EVALUATED FOR ALL CASES BEFORE AND AFTER TREATMENT, RESPECTIVELY, AND THEN THE VALUE CHANGES IN THE SCORE OF CLINICAL SYMPTOMS, FEV1, SNOT-22 SCORE, AND LUND-MACKAY SCORE BETWEEN BOTH TIME POINTS WERE CALCULATED.

MANY SURGEONS TRY TO PREVENTIVELY REDUCE ITS RESISTANCE AGAINST THE PATH IN THE POST-RHINOPLASTY PERIOD. TO THIS END, THE TWO METHODS OF \"SUB MUCOSAL PARTIAL INFERIOR TURBINECTOMY\" AND \"INFERIOR TURBINATE OUT FRACTURE\" ARE COMPARED IN THE PRESENT STUDY. METHODS: IN THIS CLINICAL STUDY, 110 RHINOPLASTY CANDIDATES WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS, NAMELY SUB MUCOSAL PARTIAL INFERIOR TURBINECTOMY AND OUT FRACTURE OF THE INFERIOR TURBINATE. TO ASSESS THE COMPLICATIONS, THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) WAS USED PRIOR TO SURGICAL INTERVENTION, AND 1, 2, 3, 6, AND 12 MONTHS FOLLOWING THE RHINOPLASTY PROCEDURES. RESULTS: BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THIS CLINICAL STUDY AND ACCORDING TO THE SNOT-22 QUESTIONNAIRE, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS PRIOR TO SURGERY AND A MONTH FOLLOWING THE SURGERY (P > 0.05). HOWEVER, THE AVERAGE SNOT-22 SCORE FOR THE SUB MUCOSAL PARTIAL INFERIOR TURBINECTOMY GROUP WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THAT OF THE GROUP WITH THE OUT FRACTURE OF THE INFERIOR TURBINATE, 2, 3, 6, AND 12 MONTHS FOLLOWING THE SURGERY. CONCLUSION: BOTH \"SUB MUCOSAL PARTIAL INFERIOR TURBINECTOMY\" AND \"OUT FRACTURE OF INFERIOR TURBINATE\" ARE EFFECTIVE METHODS IN IMPROVING THE RESPIRATORY FUNCTION OF RHINOPLASTY PATIENTS, YET THE FORMER METHOD IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE LATTER AS REGARDS IMPROVING THE RESPIRATORY FUNCTION OF PATIENTS.

DESIGN: A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY SETTING: ROYAL NATIONAL THROAT AND NOSE AND EAR HOSPITAL, LONDON UK. PARTICIPANTS: ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN PATIENTS WITH CRS; 60 CRSWNP AND 53 CRSSNP. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: OLFACTION WAS MEASURED USING BOTH THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA SMELL INVESTIGATION TEST (UPSIT) AND THE 'SENSE OF SMELL' VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS). THE NOSE SCALE, THE SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT 22) AND THE LUND-KENNEDY (LK) SURGEON REPORTED SCORES WERE ALSO MEASURED PRE- AND POSTOPERATIVELY AT 6 MONTHS. RESULTS: THE UPSIT PSYCHOPHYSICAL MEASUREMENT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED FOLLOWING ESS IN THE CRSWNP SUBGROUP AS DID THE PATIENTS PERCEIVED VAS SENSE OF SMELL. HOWEVER, IN THE CRSSNP SUBGROUP, THE IMPROVED VAS AND UPSIT MEASUREMENTS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT. THE NOSE, SNOT 22 AND LK SCORES ALL IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY. THE OLFACTORY IMPROVEMENT AS MEASURED BY THE UPSIT CORRELATED TO THE SNOT-22, BUT A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE NOSE SCORE AND UPSIT WAS NOT FOUND. CONCLUSIONS: ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED THE PATIENT'S PERCEIVED AND MEASURED SENSE OF SMELL IN THE CRSWNP SUBGROUP WHICH IS THE MOST SURGICALLY RESPONSIVE CRS SUBGROUP. ADDITIONALLY, IMPROVED OLFACTION IN THE CRSWNP SUBGROUP IS MOST LIKELY TO IMPROVE THE PATIENT'S QUALITY OF LIFE.

METHODS: ADULT PATIENTS WITH MEDICALLY RECALCITRANT CRS (N = 665) WERE ENROLLED IN A PROSPECTIVE, OBSERVATIONAL COHORT STUDY. PREOPERATIVE LMCTS AND PRE- AND POSTOPERATIVE SELF-REPORTED QOL OUTCOMES (22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOMES TEST [SNOT-22]) WERE COLLECTED AND EVALUATED OVER 12 MONTHS. FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY-EIGHT PATIENTS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA.

METHODS: TWENTY-NINE PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WERE RANDOMIZED IN 2 OPERATIVE GROUPS (UNCINECTOMY OR BALLOON SINUPLASTY). BEFORE AND 6 MONTHS AFTER THE TREATMENT, PATIENTS FILLED OUT A QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE (SINO NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 [SNOT-22]), AND MUCOCILIARY CLEARANCE WAS MEASURED WITH ENDOSCOPE AND GAMMA CAMERA AFTER 0.03 ML OF SACCHARINE, METHYLENE-BLUE DYE, AND HUMAN ALBUMIN LABELED WITH TC99M WAS INTRODUCED TO THE BOTTOM OF MAXILLARY SINUSES. RESULTS: IN UNCINECTOMY GROUP, SNOT-22 SCORE DECREASED, BUT TREATMENT HAD NO EFFECT ON MUCOCILIARY CLEARANCE.

DELAYED IDENTIFICATION OF CRS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO WORSENING HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE AND INCREASED TREATMENT BURDEN. OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE UTILITY OF THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AS A TOOL TO IDENTIFY CRS IN ADULTS WITH CF. METHODS: IN THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY, PARTICIPANTS WERE SAMPLED FROM AN ADULT-SPECIFIC CF CLINIC IN VANCOUVER, CANADA, BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 2013 AND APRIL 2014. CRS WAS DETERMINED BY USE OF STANDARDIZED DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINES. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE SNOT-22 AND MEDICAL CHARTS WERE REVIEWED FOR ADDITIONAL PREDICTOR VARIABLES. LOGISTIC REGRESSION WAS USED TO COMPARE THE SNOT-22 AS A UNIVARIABLE PREDICTOR VARIABLE TO A MULTIVARIABLE PREDICTION MODEL, IN ORDER TO BEST DIFFERENTIATE CRS AND NON-CRS PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: NINETY-THREE OF 101 ADULTS PROVIDED WRITTEN INFORMED CONSENT. THE PREVALENCE OF CRS WAS 56.3% (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], 45.9% TO 66.3%). INDIVIDUALS WITH CRS REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SNOT-22 SCORES THAN NON-CRS PARTICIPANTS (MEAN DIFFERENCE: 13.9; 95% CI, 6.1 TO 21.7). THE OPTIMAL SNOT-22 SCORE TO DIFFERENTIATE CRS WAS 21 OUT OF 110 (SENSITIVITY: 76%, SPECIFICITY: 61%, POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE: 71%, LIKELIHOOD RATIO: 1.9). CONCLUSION: COMPARED TO THE CURRENT DIAGNOSTIC GOLD STANDARD, SNOT-22 SCORES GREATER THAN 21 SUFFICIENTLY IDENTIFIED ADULTS WITH CF PRESENTING WITH CONCOMITANT CRS. THE SNOT-22 IS A SIMPLE INSTRUMENT THAT CAN EASILY BE IMPLEMENTED IN ADULT CF CLINICS TO ASSIST CARE PROVIDERS IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS REQUIRING MORE DETAILED ASSESSMENT OR REFERRAL TO A SINUS CLINIC.","SCHOOL OF POPULATION AND PUBLIC HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA.; ST.; PAUL'S SINUS CENTRE, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA.; ST.; PAUL'S HOSPITAL DIVISION OF RESPIROLOGY, DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA.; SCHOOL OF POPULATION AND PUBLIC HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA.; ST.; PAUL'S SINUS CENTRE, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA.; SCHOOL OF POPULATION AND PUBLIC HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA.; ST.; PAUL'S SINUS CENTRE, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA.; ST.; PAUL'S HOSPITAL DIVISION OF RESPIROLOGY, DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA.; ST.; PAUL'S SINUS CENTRE, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA.;",NA,"© 2015 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2015/08/01 06:00","20161019","20150730",2015,"2015/08/01 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"12",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.21607 [DOI]","20161230","2016/12/30 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","1111-7","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"26228968","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2015 DEC;5(12):1111-7.

WE PRESENT OUR INSTITUTIONS DATA REGARDING THE OUTCOME OF PATIENTS REQUIRING REVISION EMLP. METHODS: DATA WAS COLLECTED PROSPECTIVELY. PATIENTS UNDERGOING PRIMARY EMLP BETWEEN JANUARY 2001 AND DECEMBER 2013 WITH A MINIMUM FOLLOW-UP OF 6 MONTHS WERE INCLUDED. INFORMATION RELATED TO DEMOGRAPHICS, ASTHMA STATUS, ASPIRIN SENSITIVITY, 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORE, LUND-MACKAY SCORES, INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS, AND ENDOSCOPIC OSTIUM ASSESSMENT WERE COLLECTED. RESULTS: THERE WERE 213 PRIMARY EMLPS COMPLETED WITH AVERAGE FOLLOW-UP OF 36 MONTHS. THE FAILURE RATE OF PRIMARY EMLP WAS 8.9% (19/213), WHEREAS THE FAILURE RATE OF REVISION EMLP WAS 21% (4/19). RISK FACTORS FOR FAILURE OF PRIMARY EMLP INCLUDED THE PRESENCE OF INTRAOPERATIVE PUS, MORE THAN 5 PREVIOUS SINUS OPERATIONS AND ASPIRIN-EXACERBATED RESPIRATORY DISEASE (AERD). REVISION OF EMLP WAS UNDERTAKEN PRIMARILY DUE TO RECURRENCE OF NASAL POLYPS OR OSTIUM STENOSIS. THOSE PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT REVISION EMLP EXPERIENCED SYMPTOMATIC IMPROVEMENT AND NO MAJOR COMPLICATIONS FOLLOWING THE PROCEDURE. CONCLUSION: THE FAILURE RATE OF REVISION EMLP IS 21% IN OUR SERIES. THE MAJORITY OF REVISIONS WERE FOR NASAL POLYP RECURRENCE. REVISION EMLP IS A SAFE AND WELL-TOLERATED PROCEDURE IN THE SMALL GROUP OF PATIENTS THAT REQUIRE FURTHER SURGERY.

INTRANASAL STEROID THERAPY IS THE MOST COMMONLY USED TREATMENT FOR CRS. THERE ARE MANY EVALUATION TOOLS DEDICATED TO ASSESSING CRS PATIENTS' QOL, BUT NONE OF THEM EVALUATES QOL DURING LOCAL STEROID THERAPY. MUCOSAL ATOMIZATION DEVICES (MADS) AND NASAL SALINE IRRIGATION (NSI) ARE EFFECTIVE AND SAFE METHODS OF APPLYING INTRANASAL STEROIDS FOR CRS PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE SAMPLE POPULATION FOR THIS PROSPECTIVE STUDY COMPRISED 43 CRS PATIENTS. FOLLOWING ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY, ALL PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED INTRANASAL STEROIDS ADMINISTERED VIA AN MAD, FOLLOWED BY NSI FOR 1.5 MONTHS. EACH PARTICIPANT COMPLETED THE SNOT-22 (22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOMES TEST) SCORE AND A NEW QUESTIONNAIRE, THE COMPLEMENTARY TOPICAL NASAL DRUG DELIVERY QUESTIONNAIRE (THE COMPLEMENTARY QUESTIONNAIRE), AT THE END OF 3 MONTHS OF INTRANASAL STEROID THERAPY. RESULTS: THE PATIENTS' RESPONSES IN BOTH THE SNOT-22 SCORE AND THE COMPLEMENTARY QUESTIONNAIRE REVEALED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THEIR ADVERSE EXPERIENCES. THE PATIENTS WHO RECEIVED INTRANASAL STEROID TREATMENT USING NSI EXPERIENCED MORE FREQUENTLY DELAYED NASAL DRAINAGE, HIGHER FREQUENCY OF EAR SYMPTOMS, AND FACIAL PAIN/PRESSURE, WHILE THOSE WHOSE THERAPY WAS ADMINISTERED USING AN MAD REPORTED COMPLAINTS SUCH AS NASAL IRRITATION, NASAL DRYNESS, AND POSTNASAL DRIP WITH UNPLEASANT TASTE/SMELL. CONCLUSION: WE USED THE COMPLEMENTARY QUESTIONNAIRE AS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR ASSESSMENT OF THE QOL OF CRS PATIENTS. THE SNOT-22 SCORE AND THE COMPLEMENTARY QUESTIONNAIRE MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO SELECT AN INTRANASAL APPLICATOR TAILORED TO A CRS PATIENT'S SPECIFIC COMPLAINTS.","DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, FACULTY OF MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF WARSAW, WARSAW, POLAND.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, FACULTY OF MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF WARSAW, WARSAW, POLAND.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, FACULTY OF MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF WARSAW, WARSAW, POLAND.; MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND TELEMEDICINE DEPARTMENT, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF WARSAW, WARSAW, POLAND.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, FACULTY OF MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF WARSAW, WARSAW, POLAND.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021/04/13 20:09","20211110","20210413",2021,"2021/04/14 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"5",NA,"1941-2703 (ELECTRONIC) 1941-2711 (LINKING)","101475057","JOURNAL OF AEROSOL MEDICINE AND PULMONARY DRUG DELIVERY","ENG","10.1089/JAMP.2020.1644 [DOI]","20211110","2021/11/11 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","311-321","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"33848434","PPUBLISH","0 (STEROIDS)",NA,NA,"J AEROSOL MED PULM DRUG DELIV. 2021 SEP;34(5):311-321.

MANUKA HONEY HAS WELL-DOCUMENTED ANTIMICROBIAL AND ANTIFUNGAL PROPERTIES AND IS CURRENTLY BEING USED BY PHYSICIANS ACROSS THE WORLD FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF MEDICAL PROBLEMS. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MEDIHONEY ANTIBACTERIAL MEDICAL HONEY IN PATIENTS WHO CONTINUE TO SUFFER FROM AFRS RESISTANT TO CONVENTIONAL MEDICAL TREATMENT AFTER BILATERAL FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY AND MAXIMAL POSTOPERATIVE MEDICAL MANAGEMENT. METHODS: A RANDOMIZED, SINGLE-BLIND, PROSPECTIVE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT A TERTIARY CENTRE. THIRTY-FOUR PATIENTS WITH AFRS SPRAYED ONE NOSTRIL WITH 2 ML OF A 50/50 MIXTURE OF HONEY-SALINE SOLUTION ONCE A DAY AT NIGHT FOR 30 DAYS. OTHERWISE, PATIENTS CONTINUED WITH THEIR REGULAR NASAL REGIMEN IN BOTH NOSTRILS. A 5-POINT IMPROVEMENT IN OUR CLINIC'S ENDOSCOPIC GRADING SYSTEM WAS CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT. DURING THEIR PRE- AND POSTASSESSMENT, PATIENTS' SINUS CAVITIES WERE CULTURED, AND THE PATIENTS FILLED OUT A SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) QUESTIONNAIRE TO ASSESS SUBJECTIVE NASAL SYMPTOMS. RESULTS: AS A GROUP, THE 34 PATIENTS WHO COMPLETED THE STUDY SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE TREATED NOSTRILS VERSUS CONTROL NOSTRILS (P  =  1.000). HOWEVER, THE NINE PATIENTS WHO DID RESPOND TO THE HONEY TREATMENT RELATIVE TO THEIR CONTROL SIDE RESPONDED VERY WELL. A NUMBER OF THESE PATIENTS HAD HIGH IGE LEVELS IN THEIR BLOOD.

THE SIZE OF THE MAXILLARY OSTIUM WAS MEASURED FROM THE CBCT SCANS THREE-DIMENSIONALLY. THE ASSOCIATION OF CHANGES IN THE SNOT-22 SCORES OF THE OSTIUM WAS ANALYSED. WE DISCOVERED THAT THE BALLOON SINUPLASTY INCREASED THE SIZE OF THE MAXILLARY OSTIUM IN ALL DIMENSIONS. THE CHANGES WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05) IN THE AXIAL DIAMETER AND THE OSTIUM AREA. THE NUMBER OF PATENT OSTIA INCREASED AFTER THE INTERVENTION. THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SNOT-22 SCORE AND OSTIUM PATENCY WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT BEFORE THE OPERATION.

A SINGLE RETROSPECTIVE STUDY REPORTED WORSE POSTOPERATIVE QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES IN DM PATIENTS WITH CRS. OUR STUDY EVALUATED THE EFFECT OF COMORBID DM ON OUTCOMES OF ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS) USING A PROSPECTIVE STUDY DESIGN. METHODS: USING A MULTICENTERED, PROSPECTIVE COHORT OF PATIENTS (N = 437) UNDERGOING ESS FOR RECALCITRANT CRS, A NESTED CASE-CONTROL COMPARISON WAS PERFORMED BETWEEN 20 ADULT DM PATIENTS (CASES) AND 20 NON-DM PATIENTS (CONTROLS), MATCHED 1:1 FOR AGE AND LUND-MACKAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) SCORES. OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), RHINOSINUSITIS DISABILITY INDEX (RSDI), PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE (PHQ-2), AND BRIEF SMELL IDENTIFICATION TEST (BSIT). RESULTS: MEAN FOLLOW-UP WAS SIMILAR BETWEEN CASES (MEAN ± STANDARD DEVIATION: 12.6 ± 6.0 MONTHS) AND CONTROLS (12.9 ± 5.9 MONTHS; P = 0.862). ALL PREOPERATIVE SCORES WERE STATISTICALLY EQUIVALENT BETWEEN DM AND NON-DM COHORTS.

CONCLUSION: DM PATIENTS WITH CRS EXPERIENCE SIMILAR DEGREES OF SYMPTOMATIC BENEFIT FROM ESS COMPARED TO CONTROLS.

WE SOUGHT TO DETERMINE WHY TERTIARY SURGEONS MAY DEVIATE FROM THE SUGGESTED CRITERIA AND EVALUATED WHETHER THOSE DEVIATIONS RESULT IN CHANGE IN OUTCOMES. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH UNCOMPLICATED CRS WERE PROSPECTIVELY ENROLLED OVER THE COURSE OF 1 YEAR. THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOMES TEST (SNOT-22), A GENERAL HEALTH OUTCOME OUT OF 100, AND A PHYSICIAN FORM, INDICATING MANAGEMENT PATHWAY AND DECISION MAKING, WAS COMPLETED AT EACH VISIT OVER A 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. A DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS WAS USED TO QUANTIFY REASONS FOR VEERING FROM THE \"APPROPRIATENESS CRITERIA,\" AND REPEATED LINEAR REGRESSION MODELING WAS USED TO MEASURE WHETHER COMPLIANCE IMPACTED SNOT-22, GENERAL HEALTH, AND LUND-KENNEDY (LK) SCORES OVER THE PERIOD OF STUDY. RESULTS: ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-FIVE PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED. SIXTY-EIGHT PERCENT FOLLOWED THE APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT PATHWAY BASED ON THEIR PRESENTATION AND THE SUGGESTED CRITERIA. DISPARATE REASONS WERE DOCUMENTED FOR DEVIATION IN THE OTHER 32%, AND, DESPITE ESTABLISHING SEVERAL PREDICTIVE CATEGORIES, \"OTHER\" WAS THE MOST COMMON REASON, WITH VARIOUS EXPLANATIONS WELL DOCUMENTED.

EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE ROLE OF SUBSTANCE P IN A CONTACT HEADACHE SUCH THAT RELEASE OF SUBSTANCE P FROM SENSORY NERVE ENDINGS CAUSES INFLAMMATION AND ALLERGY. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE POSSIBLE DIFFERENCES IN SUBSTANCE P LEVELS IN INFERIOR TURBINATE HYPERTROPHY CREATING A CONTACT HEADACHE. METHODS: 28 PATIENTS WHO HAD CONTACT HEADACHES (STUDY GROUP) AND 16 VOLUNTEERS WITH NO COMPLAINTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. SUBSTANCE P LEVELS IN THE INFERIOR TURBINATE TISSUE SAMPLES WERE QUANTIFIED USING A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE SUBSTANCE P EIA KIT. RESULTS: IN THE STUDY GROUP AVERAGE SUBSTANCE P LEVELS WERE 2.65±0.27PG/MG TISSUE (RANGE: 0.61-5.44) AND IN THE CONTROL GROUP IT WAS 1.77±0.27PG/MG TISSUE (RANGE: 0.11-4.35). THE DIFFERENCE WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS (P=0.0215). AVERAGE PREOPERATIVE HEADACHE GROUP VISUAL ANALOG SCALE SCORES WAS 5.93±0.38 (2-9) AND THE TURBINATE VOLUME WAS 6.56±0.35CM(3) (3.50-10.30). THE CONTROL GROUP TURBINATE VOLUME WAS 4.71±0.39CM(3) (2.50-7.70). WE FOUND A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE VISUAL ANALOG SCALE SCORES AND SUBSTANCE P LEVELS SUCH THAT SUBSTANCE P LEVELS WERE HIGHER IN VISUAL ANALOG SCALE SCORES ABOVE 5 (P=0.001). CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTRANASAL CONTACT HEADACHES AND INCREASED MUCOSAL SUBSTANCE P LEVELS. WE ALSO FOUND THAT THERE IS NO CORRELATION WITH SUBSTANCE P LEVELS AND VOLUME OF THE INFERIOR TURBINATE.","ANTALYA EDUCATION AND RESEARCH HOSPITAL, DEPARTMENT OF EAR-NOSE-THROAT HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, ANTALYA, TURKEY.; AKDENIZ UNIVERSITY MEDICAL FACULTY, DEPARTMENT OF MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY, ANTALYA, TURKEY.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: MEYIGOR@AKDENIZ.;EDU.;TR.; ANTALYA EDUCATION AND RESEARCH HOSPITAL, DEPARTMENT OF RADIOLOGY, ANTALYA, TURKEY.; ANTALYA EDUCATION AND RESEARCH HOSPITAL, DEPARTMENT OF EAR-NOSE-THROAT HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, ANTALYA, TURKEY.; ANTALYA EDUCATION AND RESEARCH HOSPITAL, DEPARTMENT OF EAR-NOSE-THROAT HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, ANTALYA, TURKEY.; ANTALYA EDUCATION AND RESEARCH HOSPITAL, DEPARTMENT OF EAR-NOSE-THROAT HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, ANTALYA, TURKEY.; ANTALYA EDUCATION AND RESEARCH HOSPITAL, DEPARTMENT OF EAR-NOSE-THROAT HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, ANTALYA, TURKEY.; ANTALYA EDUCATION AND RESEARCH HOSPITAL, DEPARTMENT OF EAR-NOSE-THROAT HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, ANTALYA, TURKEY.; AKDENIZ UNIVERSITY MEDICAL FACULTY, DEPARTMENT OF MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY, ANTALYA, TURKEY.; AKDENIZ UNIVERSITY MEDICAL FACULTY, DEPARTMENT OF MEDICAL PHARMACOLOGY, ANTALYA, TURKEY.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT © 2019 ASSOCIAÇÃO BRASILEIRA DE OTORRINOLARINGOLOGIA E CIRURGIA CÉRVICO-FACIAL.

LONG-TERM, LOW-DOSE ADMINISTRATION OF MACROLIDES HAS BEEN SUGGESTED AS A TREATMENT OPTION. THE MACS (MACROLIDES IN CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS) STUDY IS A RANDOMIZED PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL EVALUATING THE EFFICACY OF AZITHROMYCIN (AZM) IN CRS. METHODS: WE DESCRIBE A GROUP OF PATIENTS WITH RECALCITRANT CRS WITH AND WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS UNRESPONSIVE TO OPTIMAL MEDICAL AND (IN 92% ALSO) SURGICAL TREATMENT. PATIENTS WERE TREATED WITH AZM OR PLACEBO. AZM WAS GIVEN FOR 3 DAYS AT 500 MG DURING THE FIRST WEEK, FOLLOWED BY 500 MG PER WEEK FOR THE NEXT 11 WEEKS. PATIENTS WERE MONITORED UNTIL 3 MONTHS POST-THERAPY. THE ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22), A PATIENT RESPONSE RATING SCALE, VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS), SHORT FORM-36 (SF-36), RIGID NASAL ENDOSCOPY, PEAK NASAL INSPIRATORY FLOW (PNIF), SNIFFIN' STICKS SMELL TESTS AND ENDOSCOPICALLY GUIDED MIDDLE MEATUS CULTURES. RESULTS: SIXTY PATIENTS WITH A MEDIAN AGE OF 49 YEARS WERE INCLUDED. FIFTY PER CENT HAD ASTHMA AND 58% HAD UNDERGONE REVISION SINUS SURGERY. IN THE SNOT-22, PATIENT RESPONSE RATING SCALE, VAS SCORES AND SF-36, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AZM AND THE PLACEBO GROUPS WAS DEMONSTRATED. NASAL ENDOSCOPIC FINDINGS, PNIF RESULTS, SMELL TESTS AND MICROBIOLOGY SHOWED NO RELEVANT SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GROUPS EITHER. CONCLUSION: AT THE INVESTIGATED DOSE OF AZM OVER 3 MONTHS, NO SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT WAS FOUND OVER PLACEBO. POSSIBLE REASONS COULD BE DISEASE SEVERITY IN THE INVESTIGATED GROUP, UNDER-DOSAGE OF AZM AND UNDER-POWERING OF THE STUDY.

A SUBSET OF T2RS EXPRESSED ON SINONASAL SOLITARY CHEMOSENSORY CELLS (SCCS) ARE ACTIVATED BY DENATONIUM, RESULTING IN A CALCIUM-MEDIATED SECRETION OF BACTERICIDAL ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES (AMPS) IN NEIGHBORING CILIATED EPITHELIAL CELLS. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT THERE IS PATIENT VARIABILITY IN THE AMOUNT OF BACTERIAL KILLING INDUCED BY DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS OF DENATONIUM AND THAT THE DIFFERENCES CORRELATE WITH CRS CLINICAL OUTCOMES. METHODS: BACTERIAL GROWTH INHIBITION WAS QUANTIFIED AFTER MIXING BACTERIA WITH AIRWAY SURFACE LIQUID (ASL) COLLECTED FROM DENATONIUM-STIMULATED SINONASAL AIR-LIQUID INTERFACE (ALI) CULTURES. PATIENT ASL BACTERIAL KILLING AT 0.1 MM DENATONIUM AND BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS AND SINUS SURGERY OUTCOMES WERE COMPARED BETWEEN THESE POPULATIONS. RESULTS: THERE IS VARIABILITY IN THE DEGREE OF DENATONIUM-INDUCED BACTERIAL KILLING BETWEEN PATIENTS. IN CRS WITH NASAL POLYPS (CRSWNP), PATIENTS WITH INCREASED BACTERIAL KILLING AFTER STIMULATION WITH LOW LEVELS OF DENATONIUM UNDERGO SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERIES (FESSS) (P = 0.037) AND HAVE WORSE 6-MONTH POST-FESS 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES (P = 0.012).

FACIAL PAIN WAS CHARACTERIZED IN BOTH GROUPS USING THE BRIEF PAIN INVENTORY SHORT FORM (BPI-SF) AND THE SHORT-FORM MCGILL PAIN QUESTIONNAIRE (SF-MPQ). CRS-SPECIFIC MEASURES OF DISEASE WERE MEASURED INCLUDING THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22), NASAL ENDOSCOPY, AND COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SCORING. RESULTS: THE PATIENTS COMPRISED OF CRS WITH NASAL POLYPOSIS (CRSWNP; N = 25), CRS WITHOUT NASAL POLYPOSIS (CRSSNP; N = 30), AND CONTROL PARTICIPANTS (N = 8). SUBJECTS WITH CRSWNP AND CRSSNP WERE LESS LIKELY TO BE PAIN FREE THAN CONTROLS (16.0%, 6.7%, AND 62.5% RESPECTIVELY, P = 0.001) AND CARRIED GREATER BURDEN OF PAIN AS MEASURED BY THE BPI-SF AND SF-MPQ THAN CONTROLS (P = 0.002 AND P = 0.017, RESPECTIVELY). PAIN IN CRS WAS MOST COMMONLY LOCATED AROUND THE EYES AND CHARACTERIZED AS \"THROBBING\" AND \"ACHING.\" NASAL POLYP STATUS WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENCES IN CHARACTER, SEVERITY, OR LOCATION OF PAIN. CONCLUSION: SUBJECTS WITH CRS HAVE A GREATER BURDEN OF FACIAL PAIN RELATIVE TO CONTROL SUBJECTS ACROSS SEVERAL STANDARDIZED PAIN MEASURES. FURTHER, FACIAL PAIN IN CRS SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED TO QUALITY OF LIFE AND CRS-SPECIFIC DISEASE SEVERITY MEASURES. STUDY ACROSS LARGER COHORTS USING STANDARDIZED PAIN MEASURES IS WARRANTED TO CLARIFY THE ASSOCIATION OF FACIAL PAIN WITH CRS.","DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO, SAN DIEGO, CA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY, OREGON HEALTH AND SCIENCE UNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OR.; SINUS AND SKULL BASE SURGERY PROGRAM, DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY; UNIVERSITY OF UTAH, SALT LAKE CITY, UT.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY, OREGON HEALTH AND SCIENCE UNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OR.; SINUS AND SKULL BASE SURGERY PROGRAM, DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY; UNIVERSITY OF UTAH, SALT LAKE CITY, UT.; SINUS AND SKULL BASE SURGERY PROGRAM, DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY; UNIVERSITY OF UTAH, SALT LAKE CITY, UT.;",NA,"© 2015 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,"CONFLICT OF INTEREST: TIMOTHY L.

EXTERNAL NASAL VALVE COLLAPSE IS A RARE AND CHALLENGING CONDITION. WE ATTEMPTED TO SIMPLIFY THE EXAMINATION OF THE EXTERNAL VALVE, THE SURGICAL PLANNING AND THE OUTCOME MEASURE. TO VALIDATE OUR EXTERNAL VALVE SCORE, WE FIRST ASSESSED ITS RELIABILITY (INTER-RATER AGREEMENT AND TEST-RETEST REPEATABILITY). WE SECONDLY CONSIDERED THE CLINICAL RELEVANCE BY USING OUR SCORING SYSTEM IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING SEPTORHINOPLASTY FOR EXTERNAL VALVE COLLAPSE. METHODOLOGY: FOR VALIDATION, 16 RHINOLOGISTS SCORED PATIENTS SEPARATELY ON TWO OCCASIONS. FOR THE CLINICAL RELEVANCE, 26 PATIENTS WITH EXTERNAL VALVE COLLAPSE WERE SCORED PRE- AND POST-OPERATIVELY (RESPONSIVENESS). THE EXTERNAL VALVE SCORE WAS CORRELATED TO PEAK NASAL INSPIRATORY FLOW. RESULTS: THE DEVISED SCORING SYSTEM WAS RELIABLE (SUBSTANTIAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN 16 SURGEONS WITH REPRODUCIBILITY OVER TIME). ALL PATIENTS IN OUR PROSPECTIVE SERIES SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR EXTERNAL VALVE SCORE. THE QUALITY OF LIFE MEASURED BY THE SNOT-22 TOOL SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT AFTER SURGERY.

THE LACK OF CLEAR SURGICAL INDICATIONS FOR ESS LIKELY CONTRIBUTES TO THE LARGE GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION IN SURGICAL RATES AND CONTRIBUTES TO REDUCED QUALITY OF CARE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEFINE APPROPRIATENESS CRITERIA FOR ESS DURING MANAGEMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH UNCOMPLICATED CRS. METHODS: THE RAND/UCLA APPROPRIATENESS METHODOLOGY WAS PERFORMED. AN INTERNATIONAL, MULTI-DISCIPLINARY PANEL OF 10 EXPERTS IN CRS WAS FORMED AND COMPLETED TWO ROUNDS OF A MODIFIED DELPHI RANKING PROCESS ALONG WITH A FACE-TO-FACE MEETING. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 624 CLINICAL SCENARIOS WERE RANKED, 312 SCENARIOS EACH FOR CRS WITH AND CRS WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS. FOR ADULT PATIENTS WITH UNCOMPLICATED CRS WITH NASAL POLYPS, ESS CAN BE APPROPRIATELY OFFERED WHEN THE CT LUND-MACKAY SCORE IS = 1 AND THERE HAS BEEN A MINIMUM TRIAL OF A TOPICAL INTRANASAL CORTICOSTEROID PLUS A SHORT-COURSE OF SYSTEMIC CORTICOSTEROID WITH A POST-TREATMENT TOTAL SNOT-22 SCORE = 20. FOR ADULT PATIENTS WITH UNCOMPLICATED CRS WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS, ESS CAN BE APPROPRIATELY OFFERED WHEN THE CT LUND-MACKAY SCORE IS = 1 AND THERE HAS BEEN A MINIMUM TRIAL OF A TOPICAL INTRANASAL CORTICOSTEROID PLUS EITHER A SHORT-COURSE OF A BROAD SPECTRUM/CULTURE-DIRECTED SYSTEMIC ANTIBIOTIC OR THE USE OF A PROLONGED COURSE OF SYSTEMIC LOW-DOSE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ANTIBIOTIC WITH A POST-TREATMENT TOTAL SNOT-22 SCORE = 20. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY HAS DEVELOPED AND REPORTED OF LIST OF APPROPRIATENESS CRITERIA TO OFFER ESS AS A TREATMENT OPTION DURING MANAGEMENT OF UNCOMPLICATED ADULT CRS. THE EXTENT OR TECHNIQUE OF ESS WAS NOT ADDRESSED IN THIS STUDY AND WILL DEPEND ON SURGEON AND PATIENT FACTORS. FURTHERMORE, THESE CRITERIA ARE THE MINIMAL THRESHOLD TO MAKE ESS A TREATMENT OPTION AND DO NOT IMPLY THAT ALL PATIENTS MEETING THESE CRITERIA REQUIRE SURGERY. THE DECISION TO PERFORM ESS SHOULD BE MADE AFTER AN INFORMED PATIENT MAKES A PREFERENCE-SENSITIVE DECISION TO PROCEED WITH SURGERY. APPLYING THESE APPROPRIATENESS CRITERIA FOR ESS MAY OPTIMIZE PATIENT SELECTION, REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF UNWARRANTED SURGERY, AND ASSIST CLINICIANS IN PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY, PATIENT-CENTERED CARE TO PATIENTS WITH CRS.","DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY, CALGARY, AB, CANADA.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND SINUS SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA; CHARLESTON, SC, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF ENT, GUYS AND ST THOMAS NHS TRUST, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM.; RALPH H.; JOHNSON VA MEDICAL CENTER, CHARLESTON, SC, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF INTERNAL MEDICINE, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY ALLERGY DIVISION, CHICAGO, IL, USA.; DIVISION OF ALLERGY AND IMMUNOLOGY, SCRIPPS CLINIC, LA JOLLA, CA, USA.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF UTAH, SALT LAKE CITY, UT, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER, AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS.; DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF AUCKLAND, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND SINUS SURGERY, OREGON SINUS CENTER, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, OREGON HEALTH AND SCIENCE UNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OR, USA.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016/03/03 06:00","20160721",NA,2016,"2016/03/05 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,"0300-0729 (PRINT) 0300-0729 (LINKING)","0347242","RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.4193/RHINO16.023 [DOI]","20210617","2016/07/22 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","117-28","NETHERLANDS",NA,NA,"26934470","PPUBLISH","0 (ANTI-BACTERIAL AGENTS)","IM",NA,"RHINOLOGY. 2016 JUN;54(2):117-28.

ALL PATIENTS WERE >18 YEARS OLD, DIAGNOSED WITH CRS BASED ON GUIDELINE RECOMMENDATIONS, FAILED INITIAL MEDICAL THERAPY AND ELECTED ESS. WHILE WAITING FOR ESS, ALL PATIENTS RECEIVED CONTINUED MEDICAL THERAPY. THE PREOPERATIVE WAITING PERIOD OUTCOMES (CONTINUED MEDICAL THERAPY) WERE COMPARED TO THE POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS CHANGE IN DISEASE-SPECIFIC QOL (22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST [SNOT-22]). SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE CHANGE IN ENDOSCOPIC GRADING (LUND-KENNEDY SCORE), MEDICATION CONSUMPTION, AND WORK DAYS MISSED IN THE PRECEDING 90 DAYS. RESULTS: THIRTY-ONE PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED. MEAN BASELINE SNOT-22 SCORE WAS 57.6. AFTER A MEAN OF 7.1 MONTHS OF CONTINUED MEDICAL THERAPY, THERE WAS A WORSENING IN SNOT-22 SCORE (57.6 TO 66.1; P = 0.006). AFTER ESS, WITH A MEAN POSTOPERATIVE FOLLOW-UP OF 14.6 MONTHS, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SNOT-22 SCORE (66.1 TO 16.0; P < 0.001). THERE WAS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ENDOSCOPIC GRADING (P < 0.001) COUPLED WITH A REDUCTION IN BOTH WORK DAYS LOST (P < 0.001) AND MEDICATION CONSUMPTION (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: RESULTS FROM THE STUDY SUGGEST THAT ESS IS A MORE EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION COMPARED TO CONTINUED MEDICAL THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY CRS WHO HAVE SEVERE REDUCTIONS IN THEIR BASELINE DISEASE-SPECIFIC QOL.","DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY, CALGARY, AB, CANADA.;",NA,"© 2014 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2014/09/13 06:00","20150611","20140911",2014,"2014/09/13 06:00",NA,NA,"R01 DC005805/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/UNITED STATES","10",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (PRINT) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.21366 [DOI]","20211021","2015/06/13 06:00","NIHMS625952",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","823-7",NA,"PMC4182136",NA,"25213088","PPUBLISH","0 (ANTI-ALLERGIC AGENTS)","IM","CLINICALTRIALS.GOV/NCT01332136","INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2014 OCT;4(10):823-7.

MATERIALS & METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE STUDY WAS DONE ON THE CITED SUBJECT IN A SAMPLE SIZE OF 30 PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM CRS FAILING MAXIMAL MEDICAL TREATMENT. ALL THE PATIENTS UNDERWENT FESS UNDER GENERAL ANAESTHESIA. CT SCAN WITH LUND MACKEY SCORING WAS DONE PREOPERATIVELY AND POSTOPERATIVELY. THE SYMPTOMATIC IMPROVEMENT WAS ANALYSED USING SNOT-22 SCORE OVER A TIME PERIOD OF ONE YEAR. THE SNOT-22 SCORES WERE STATISTICALLY ANALYSED WITH PRE-OP LUND MACKEY SCORES TO DRAW JUDICIOUS CONCLUSIONS. RESULTS: A MEAN LUND MACKEY PRE-OPERATIVE SCORE [LM] OF 13.1 WAS RECORDED IN THE PATIENTS UNDERGOING FESS FOR CRS. FURTHER, THE PATIENTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: ONE WITH LM SCORE LESS THAN 13.1 [GROUP-A] AND THE OTHER WITH LM SCORE OF MORE THAN 13.1 [GROUP B]. A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SYMPTOMS WITH GOOD LONG-TERM PROGNOSIS WAS RECORDED IN GROUP-B ONLY. IN ADDITION, A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN LUND MACKAY SCORE AND EXTENT OF SURGERY WAS ALSO SEEN, GREATER THE SCORE MORE EXTENSIVE THE FESS. CONCLUSION: THERE IS A PREDICTIVE VALUE OF LM SCORE IN PROGNOSIS OF FESS. WE BELIEVE THAT A MINIMUM LM SCORE OF 13.1 GIVES GOOD CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS WITH CRS WHO UNDERGO FESS AND THUS CAN BE USED AS A THRESHOLD FOR RECRUITING CRS PATIENTS FOR FESS.","DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD & NECK SURGERY, LADY HARDINGE MEDICAL COLLEGE & ASSOCIATED HOSPITALS, SHAHEED BHAGAT SINGH MARG, NEW DELHI 110001, INDIA.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: GBSNIT@YAHOO.;CO.;IN.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, APOLLO HOSPITAL, NEW DELHI, INDIA.; DEPARTMENT OF RADIODIAGNOSIS, LADY HARDINGE MEDICAL COLLEGE & ASSOCIATED HOSPITALS, SHAHEED BHAGAT SINGH MARG, NEW DELHI 110001, INDIA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD & NECK SURGERY, LADY HARDINGE MEDICAL COLLEGE & ASSOCIATED HOSPITALS, SHAHEED BHAGAT SINGH MARG, NEW DELHI 110001, INDIA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD & NECK SURGERY, LADY HARDINGE MEDICAL COLLEGE & ASSOCIATED HOSPITALS, SHAHEED BHAGAT SINGH MARG, NEW DELHI 110001, INDIA.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT © 2020 ELSEVIER INC.

STUDY DESIGN: CASE SERIES WITH CHART REVIEW. SETTING: UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF SINONASAL OUTCOMES WAS CONDUCTED FOR 30 AERD PATIENTS UNDERGOING ASPIRIN DESENSITIZATION AND MAINTENANCE THERAPY FOLLOWING ESS. SINONASAL OUTCOMES WERE PROSPECTIVELY ASSESSED BY THE SINONASAL OUTCOMES TEST-22 (SNOT-22) AND ENDOSCOPIC POLYP GRADING SYSTEM. DATA WERE COLLECTED PREOPERATIVELY, 1 AND 4 WEEKS POSTSURGERY (BEFORE DESENSITIZATION), AND 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, AND 30 MONTHS AFTER ASPIRIN DESENSITIZATION. RESULTS: TWENTY-EIGHT OF 30 PATIENTS (93.3%) SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED ASPIRIN DESENSITIZATION, WHEREAS 2 OF 30 (6.7%) WERE UNABLE TO COMPLETE DESENSITIZATION DUE TO RESPIRATORY INTOLERANCE. OF THE 21 PATIENTS WHO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED A MINIMUM OF 24 WEEKS OF FOLLOW-UP, 20 (95.2%) PATIENTS DEMONSTRATED SUSTAINED ENDOSCOPIC AND SYMPTOMATIC IMPROVEMENT FOR A MEDIAN FOLLOW-UP PERIOD OF 33 MONTHS. AFTER SURGICAL TREATMENT BUT BEFORE DESENSITIZATION, PATIENTS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN SNOT-22 AND POLYP GRADE SCORES. IN THE FIRST 6 MONTHS AFTER ASPIRIN DESENSITIZATION, PATIENTS EXPERIENCED FURTHER SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN SNOT-22 SCORES, WHEREAS POLYP GRADE REMAINED STABLE. THE IMPROVEMENTS IN SYMPTOM ENDOSCOPIC SCORES WERE PRESERVED THROUGHOUT THE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD AFTER DESENSITIZATION. NO PATIENTS REQUIRED ADDITIONAL SINUS SURGERY. ONE PATIENT HAD TO DISCONTINUE ASPIRIN THERAPY DUE TO GASTROINTESTINAL SIDE EFFECTS. NO OTHER ADVERSE REACTIONS TO ASPIRIN WERE NOTED. CONCLUSION: ASPIRIN DESENSITIZATION FOLLOWING ESS APPEARS TO BE A WELL-TOLERATED AND EFFECTIVE ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY FOR LONG-TERM CONTROL OF NASAL POLYPOSIS IN PATIENTS WITH AERD.","DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY AND BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE, PUSAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, PUSAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, BUSAN, REPUBLIC OF KOREA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, STANFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, STANFORD, CALIFORNIA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, STANFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, STANFORD, CALIFORNIA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF PEDIATRICS, DIVISION OF IMMUNOLOGY AND ALLERGY, STANFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, STANFORD, CALIFORNIA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF PEDIATRICS, DIVISION OF IMMUNOLOGY AND ALLERGY, STANFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, STANFORD, CALIFORNIA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, STANFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, STANFORD, CALIFORNIA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, STANFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, STANFORD, CALIFORNIA, USA PHWANG@OHNS.;STANFORD.;EDU.;",NA,"© AMERICAN ACADEMY OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY—HEAD AND NECK SURGERY FOUNDATION 2014.",NA,NA,NA,"2014/08/14 06:00","20150601","20140812",2014,"2014/08/15 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"4",NA,"1097-6817 (ELECTRONIC) 0194-5998 (LINKING)","8508176","OTOLARYNGOLOGY--HEAD AND NECK SURGERY : OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF AMERICAN ACADEMY OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY","ENG","10.1177/0194599814545750 [DOI]","20151119","2015/06/02 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","575-81","ENGLAND",NA,NA,"25118195","PPUBLISH","0 (ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENTS, NON-STEROIDAL) R16CO5Y76E (ASPIRIN)","IM",NA,"OTOLARYNGOL HEAD NECK SURG. 2014 OCT;151(4):575-81.

METHODS: TWO HUNDRED AND SEVEN PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED (FULL ANALYSIS SET, FAS) IN THE STUDY, INCLUDING FIVE VISITS AND LASTING FOR ~25 WEEKS. ALL PATIENTS HAD TWO TREATMENT EPISODES, AND ALL PATIENTS HAD AT LEAST ONE TREATMENT, MEANT AS ACTIVE, WITH HIGH AMPLITUDE PRESSURE FOR 10 MIN IN EACH NOSTRIL. GROUP 1 HAD TWO SUCH TREATMENTS, AND GROUP 2 HAD ONE TREATMENT WITH LOW AMPLITUDE PRESSURE, INITIALLY MEANT AS PLACEBO, ON ONE OCCASION. BECAUSE OF NUMERICAL IMPROVEMENTS IN THESE TWO GROUPS, A NEW CONTROL GROUP, GROUP 3, WAS INTRODUCED. THEY HAD ONE NEW CONTROL TREATMENT WHERE THE BALLOON WAS INSERTED INTO THE NOSE, WITHOUT ANY AIR INFLATION AND WITHOUT OSCILLATIONS. RESULTS: KOS TREATMENT WITH HIGH AMPLITUDE PRESSURE DID NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT BENEFICIAL EFFECTS AS COMPARED TO LOW AMPLITUDE PRESSURE ON TVRSS.

ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY IS RECOMMENDED AS A STANDARD METHOD WHEN MEDICAL TREATMENT FAILS. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF VARIOUS COMPLEMENTARY SURGICAL METHODS SUCH AS ENDOSCOPIC PARTIAL MIDDLE-TURBINECTOMY IS CONTROVERSIAL IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF CRS SYMPTOMS IN THESE PATIENTS. THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF ENDOSCOPIC PARTIAL MIDDLE-TURBINECTOMY ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS AND NASAL POLYPS (CRSWNP) IN IRAN. METHOD: NINETY PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP OF GRADES 3 AND 4 WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER AN INTERVENTION (45 PATIENTS) OR CONTROL GROUP (45 PATIENTS). IN THE CONTROL GROUP, ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY WITHOUT MIDDLE TURBINECTOMY WAS PERFORMED AND IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP, ENDOSCOPIC PARTIAL MIDDLE-TURBINECTOMY WAS PERFORMED IN ADDITION TO ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY. TO EVALUATE THE OUTCOMES, THE SNOT-22 QOL QUESTIONNAIRE WAS USED, AND THE RESULTS WERE ANALYZED USING SPSS VERSION 24. RESULTS: MOST OF THE PATIENTS WERE MALE AND HAD A MEAN AGE OF 39 YEARS. THE MEAN SNOT-22 QOL QUESTIONNAIRE SCORES WERE 49.13 ± 16.72 AND 52.51 ± 16.95 BEFORE SURGERY IN THE CONTROL AND INTERVENTION GROUPS RESPECTIVELY, WHICH DID NOT SHOW ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE. IN CONTRAST, AFTER ENDOSCOPIC SURGERY THESE SCORES CHANGED TO 28.46 ± 12.38 AND 11.13 ± 5.55 IN THE CONTROL AND INTERVENTION GROUPS, RESPECTIVELY AND THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BOTH GROUPS.

ALTHOUGH THE RESULTS OF SINUS SURGERY VARY WIDELY, NO KNOWN GENETIC FACTOR HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED TO PREDICT SURGICAL OUTCOMES. THE BITTER TASTE RECEPTOR T2R38 HAS RECENTLY BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO REGULATE UPPER AIRWAY INNATE DEFENSE AND MAY AFFECT PATIENT RESPONSES TO THERAPY. OUR GOAL WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER TAS2R38 GENETICS PREDICTS OUTCOMES IN CRS PATIENTS FOLLOWING SINUS SURGERY. METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF PATIENTS UNDERGOING SINUS SURGERY EVALUATING POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES THROUGH THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). PATIENTS WERE GENOTYPED FOR TAS2R38. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 123 PATIENTS WITH CRS WERE INITIALLY ANALYZED; 82 PATIENTS SHOWED NASAL POLYPS (CRSWNP) AND 41 PATIENTS WERE WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS (CRSSNP). SIX MONTHS AFTER SURGERY, THE OVERALL SNOT-22 IMPROVEMENT WAS 25 ± 23 POINTS. THE TAS2R38 GENOTYPE WAS FOUND TO SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATE WITH SURGICAL OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS WITHOUT POLYPS; HOMOZYGOTES FOR THE FUNCTIONAL RECEPTOR HAD A MEAN IMPROVEMENT OF 38 ± 21, WHEREAS HETEROZYGOTES OR HOMOZYGOTES FOR THE NONFUNCTIONAL RECEPTOR HAD A MEAN IMPROVEMENT OF 12 ± 22 (P = 0.006). THIS RESULT WAS CONFIRMED WITH A MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION THAT INCORPORATED FURTHER PATIENTS WITH 1-MONTH AND 3-MONTH SCORES (N = 207). CONCLUSION: IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING SINUS SURGERY FOR CRS, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A GENETIC POLYMORPHISM THAT PREDICTS VARIABILITY IN QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENT FOLLOWING SURGERY AT 6 MONTHS IN NONPOLYPOID CRS. THIS IS THE FIRST GENETIC POLYMORPHISM IDENTIFIED THAT HAS DEMONSTRATED TO PREDICT SURGICAL OUTCOME FOR A SELECT GROUP OF CRS PATIENTS.","DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, PHILADELPHIA, PA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, PHILADELPHIA, PA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, PHILADELPHIA, PA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, PHILADELPHIA, PA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, PHILADELPHIA, PA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, PHILADELPHIA, PA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, PHILADELPHIA, PA.; MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES CENTER, PHILADELPHIA, PA.; MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES CENTER, PHILADELPHIA, PA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, PHILADELPHIA, PA.; MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES CENTER, PHILADELPHIA, PA.; MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES CENTER, PHILADELPHIA, PA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, PHILADELPHIA, PA.;",NA,"© 2015 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2015/11/13 06:00","20161011","20151112",2016,"2015/11/13 06:00",NA,NA,"P30DC011735/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/UNITED STATES P30 DC011735/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/UNITED STATES R01DC013588/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/UNITED STATES R01 DC013588/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/UNITED STATES R01DC004698/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/UNITED STATES","1",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (PRINT) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.21666 [DOI]","20181113","2016/10/12 06:00","NIHMS775673",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","25-33",NA,"PMC4830631",NA,"26562612","PPUBLISH","0 (GENETIC MARKERS) 0 (RECEPTORS, G-PROTEIN-COUPLED) 0 (TASTE RECEPTORS, TYPE 2)","IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2016 JAN;6(1):25-33.

CONSEQUENTLY, THE ROLE OF ANTIBIOTICS AS A COMPONENT OF MAXIMAL MEDICAL THERAPY FOR ECRS HAS BEEN CALLED INTO QUESTION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER THE USE OF ANTIBIOTICS, WHICH LACK ANY SECONDARY ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PROPERTIES, ARE USEFUL IN THE TREATMENT OF ECRS. STUDY DESIGN: PROSPECTIVE INDIVIDUAL COHORT STUDY. METHODS: INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD-APPROVED, PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF 39 PATIENTS PRESENTING WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS). IN ALL PATIENTS, LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPY SCORES, LUND-MACKAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SCORES, AND SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22(SNOT-22) SCORES WERE OBTAINED BEFORE AND AFTER TREATMENT WITH AMOXICILLIN-CLAVULANIC ACID TWICE A DAY (625 MG) FOR 4 WEEKS. PATIENTS WERE SUBSEQUENTLY STRATIFIED INTO ECRS AND NON-ECRS GROUPS BASED ON HAVING OVER 10 EOSINOPHILS PER HIGH-POWER FIELD BY HISTOPATHOLOGICAL EXAMINATION. THE EFFICACY OF ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY WAS COMPARED BETWEEN GROUPS USING THE NONPARAMETRIC MANN-WHITNEY U TEST. RESULTS: WITHIN THE NON-ECRS GROUP (N = 14), THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BOTH THE LUND-MACKAY SCORE (P = .002) AND SNOT-22 SCORE (P < .001) BUT NOT THE ENDOSCOPY SCORE. AMONG THE ECRS PATIENTS (N = 25), THE LUND-MACKAY SCORE WAS SIMILARLY IMPROVED (P = .007); HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE ENDOSCOPY OR SNOT-22 SCORES. CONCLUSIONS: THE USE OF ANTIBIOTICS WITHOUT INDEPENDENT ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PROPERTIES HAVE LIMITED EFFICACY IN PATIENTS WITH ECRS. THE CONCEPT OF MAXIMAL MEDICAL THERAPY USING ANTIBIOTICS MUST CONTINUE TO EVOLVE IN THE SETTING OF NEW EVIDENCE FOR INFLAMMATORY SUBTYPES OF CRS. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2B.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEFINE APPROPRIATENESS CRITERIA FOR ESS DURING MANAGEMENT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH UNCOMPLICATED CRS. METHODS: THE RAND/UCLA APPROPRIATENESS METHODOLOGY WAS PERFORMED. AN INTERNATIONAL, MULTIDISCIPLINARY PANEL OF 10 EXPERTS IN CRS WAS FORMED AND COMPLETED 2 ROUNDS OF A MODIFIED DELPHI RANKING PROCESS ALONG WITH A FACE-TO-FACE MEETING.

OTHER PRIMARY SLEEP DISORDERS ALSO AFFECT QOL. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF COMORBID OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA (OSA) ON CRS DISEASE-SPECIFIC QOL AND SLEEP DYSFUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH CRS FOLLOWING FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: PROSPECTIVE MULTISITE COHORT STUDY CONDUCTED BETWEEN OCTOBER 2011 AND NOVEMBER 2014 AT ACADEMIC, TERTIARY REFERRAL CENTERS WITH A POPULATION-BASED SAMPLE OF 405 ADULTS. INTERVENTION: FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY FOR MEDICALLY REFRACTORY SYMPTOMS OF CRS. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES CONSISTED OF PREOPERATIVE AND POSTOPERATIVE SCORES OPERATIONALIZED BY THE RHINOSINUSITIS DISABILITY INDEX (RSDI) SURVEY, THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), AND THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI). OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA WAS THE PRIMARY, INDEPENDENT RISK FACTOR. RESULTS: OF 405 PARTICIPANTS, 60 (15%) HAD COMORBID OSA. A TOTAL OF 285 (70%) PARTICIPANTS PROVIDED PREOPERATIVE AND POSTOPERATIVE SURVEY RESPONSES, WITH A MEAN (SD) OF 13.7 (5.3) MONTHS OF FOLLOW-UP. SIGNIFICANT POSTOPERATIVE IMPROVEMENT (P < .05) WAS REPORTED ACROSS ALL MEAN DISEASE-SPECIFIC QOL MEASURES FOR BOTH PARTICIPANTS WITH AND WITHOUT COMORBID OSA. PARTICIPANTS WITHOUT OSA REPORTED SIGNIFICANT GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN UNADJUSTED MEAN (SD) RSDI GLOBAL SCORES (-25.0 [23.3] VS. -16.5 [22.1]; P = .03), RSDI PHYSICAL (-10.7 [9.2] VS. -7.3 [9.1]; P = .03) AND FUNCTIONAL (-8.4 [8.7] VS. -5.1 [7.5]; P = .03) SUBDOMAIN SCORES, AND SNOT-22 RHINOLOGIC SYMPTOM DOMAIN SCORES (-9.1 [7.7] VS. -5.7 [6.9]; P = .008). PARTICIPANTS WITHOUT OSA ALSO REPORTED GREATER IMPROVEMENTS ON MEAN (SD) PSQI GLOBAL (-1.9 [4.0] VS. -0.5 [3.7]; P = .03), SLEEP QUALITY (-0.4 [0.8] VS. -0.03 [0.7]; P = .02), AND SLEEP DISTURBANCE (-0.4 [0.7] VS. -0.1 [0.7]; P = .03) SCORES. THE MAJORITY OF THESE ASSOCIATIONS WERE FOUND TO BE DURABLE AFTER ADJUSTMENT FOR ALTERNATE INDEPENDENT COFACTORS USING STEPWISE LINEAR REGRESSION MODELING. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: PATIENTS WITH CRS AND COMORBID OSA HAVE POOR QOL WITH SUBSTANTIAL DISEASE-SPECIFIC QOL IMPROVEMENTS FOLLOWING SURGERY. PATIENTS WHO PRESENT WITH CRS SHOULD BE ASSESSED FOR PRIMARY SLEEP DISORDERS AND, IF IDENTIFIED, SHOULD BE TREATED CONCURRENTLY FOR BOTH CRS AND OSA TO IMPROVE SLEEP DYSFUNCTION TO OPTIMIZE SURGICAL OUTCOMES.

METHODS: FIFTY PATIENTS (20 FEMALES AND 30 MALES) WITH SEPTAL DEVIATION WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY AND WERE DIVIDED INTO 6 GROUPS ACCORDING TO DEVIATION TYPE AFTER EXAMINATION BY NASAL ENDOSCOPY AND PARANASAL COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY. THE SACCHARIN CLEARANCE TEST TO EVALUATE THE NASAL MUCOCILIARY CLEARANCE TIME, CONNECTICUT CHEMOSENSORY CLINICAL RESEARCH CENTER SMELL TEST FOR OLFACTORY FUNCTION, AND SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22) FOR PATIENT SATISFACTION WERE APPLIED PREOPERATIVELY AND POSTOPERATIVELY AT THE SIXTH WEEK AFTER SURGERY.

NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND IN OLFACTORY AND SNOT-22 SCORES FOR ANY OF THE DNS TYPES (BOTH CONVEX AND CONCAVE SIDES) (P > 0.05). IN ADDITION, THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE SACCHARIN CLEARANCE TIME (SCT) OF THE CONCAVE AND CONVEX SIDES (P > 0.05). ACCORDING TO THE DNS TYPE, THE MEAN SCT OF THE CONVEX SIDES SHOWED NO DIFFERENCE, BUT THAT OF THE CONCAVE SIDES SHOWED A DIFFERENCE IN TYPES 3, 4, 5, AND 6. THESE TYPES HAD A PROLONGED SCT (P < 0.05). OLFACTORY SCORES REVEALED NO DIFFERENCE POSTOPERATIVELY IN TYPES 5 AND 6 BUT WERE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN TYPES 1 TO 4 (P < 0.05). THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE HEALING OF BOTH THE MUCOCILIARY CLEARANCE (MCC) AND OLFACTORY FUNCTIONS. SNOT-22 RESULTS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN TYPE 3. CONCLUSION: ALL DNS TYPES DISTURB THE QOL REGARDING NASAL MCC AND OLFACTION FUNCTIONS. MCC VALUES, OLFACTORY FUNCTION, AND QOL SCORES ARE SIMILAR AMONG THE DNS TYPES. BOTH SIDES OF THE DNS TYPES AFFECT THE MCC SCORES SYMMETRICALLY. SEPTAL SURGERY IMPROVES OLFACTION FUNCTION AND QOL AT THE SIXTH WEEK FOLLOWING SURGERY BUT DISTURBS NASAL MCC; THUS, THE SIXTH WEEK IS TOO EARLY TO ASSESS NASAL MCC.","OKMEYDANI TRAINING AND RESEARCH HOSPITAL EAR NOSE AND THROAT CLINIC, SISLI, ISTANBUL, TURKEY.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016/06/15 06:00","20170425",NA,2016,"2016/06/15 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"5",NA,"1536-3732 (ELECTRONIC) 1049-2275 (LINKING)","9010410","THE JOURNAL OF CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY","ENG","10.1097/SCS.0000000000002696 [DOI]","20181202","2017/04/26 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","1151-5","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"27300450","PPUBLISH",NA,NA,NA,"J CRANIOFAC SURG. 2016 JUL;27(5):1151-5.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN THE IMPACT OF SINONASAL SYMPTOMATOLOGY ON GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL IN ODONTOGENIC CRS COMPARED TO NON-ODONTOGENIC CRS. THIS WAS A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF 21 ODONTOGENIC CRS PATIENTS WHO VISITED OUR TERTIARY CARE CENTER. THE SEVERITY OF SINONASAL SYMPTOMATOLOGY AND CRS-SPECIFIC QOL DETRIMENT WAS MEASURED USING THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOMES TEST (SNOT-22) AND GENERAL HEALTH-RELATED QOL WAS MEASURED USING THE HEALTH UTILITY INDEX FROM THE 5-ITEM EUROQOL SURVEY (EQ-5D HUV). COMPARED TO NON-ODONTOGENIC CRS, ODONTOGENIC CRS WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH A DIFFERENCE IN SNOT-22 SCORE [LINEAR REGRESSION COEFFICIENT (<U+0392>) = - 1.57, 95% CI - 12.47 TO 9.32, P = 0.777] BUT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED EQ-5D HUV (<U+0392> = - 0.10, 95% CI - 0.17 TO - 0.03, P = 0.008).

ANTIBIOTIC USE FOR AECRS HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED BASED ON EXTRAPOLATION OF DATA FROM ACUTE RHINOSINUSITIS (ARS) OR NON-PLACEBO-CONTROLLED STUDIES. THIS STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE WHETHER ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY MODIFIES THE COURSE OF AECRS IN A RANDOMIZED, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED STUDY. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH AECRS WERE RANDOMIZED IN A DOUBLE-BLINDED MANNER (2:1 RATIO) TO RECEIVE EITHER AMOXICILLIN-CLAVULANATE 875 MG/125 MG TWICE DAILY (BID) (AMX-CLAV, N = 21) OR PLACEBO CAPSULES (N = 11) DURING 14 DAYS. ALL PATIENTS WERE ALSO TREATED WITH MOMETASONE FUROATE AND NASAL WASHES WITH SALINE. GLOBAL SINONASAL SYMPTOMS (SEVERITY SYMPTOM ASSESSMENT [SSA]), QUALITY OF LIFE (22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST [SNOT-22]), NASAL ENDOSCOPIC SCORE (LUND-KENNEDY), AND MICROBIOLOGICAL EVALUATION WERE COMPARED TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY IN AECRS. RESULTS: DESPITE THE MAJORITY OF BACTERIA CULTURED FROM THE MIDDLE MEATUS SWAB WERE SENSITIVE FOR AMX-CLAV (84%), BOTH AMX-CLAV AND PLACEBO-TREATED GROUPS PRESENTED THE SAME CLINICAL COURSE, WITH NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS. BOTH GROUPS EXHIBITED OVERALL IMPROVEMENT OF SYMPTOMS ON DAY 14 COMPARED TO DAY 0 (P < 0.01), ESPECIALLY THE ITEMS \"NASAL SECRETION\" AND \"NASAL OBSTRUCTION\" (P < 0.05). WE ALSO OBSERVED THE SAME EVOLUTION OF NASAL ENDOSCOPIC AND QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES BETWEEN PLACEBO AND AMX-CLAV. CONCLUSION: WE CONCLUDED THAT AMX-CLAV FOR 14 DAYS DID NOT CHANGE THE CLINICAL COURSE OF AECRS COMPARED WITH PLACEBO. THE ADDITION OF AN ORAL ANTIBIOTIC TO ONGOING TOPICAL INTRANASAL STEROID SPRAY MAY NOT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL BENEFIT DURING MANAGEMENT OF AECRS.","DEPARTMENT OF OPHTHALMOLOGY, OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, AND HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DIVISION OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, RIBEIRÃO PRETO MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF SÃO PAULO (USP), SÃO PAULO, BRAZIL.; DEPARTMENT OF OPHTHALMOLOGY, OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, AND HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DIVISION OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, RIBEIRÃO PRETO MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF SÃO PAULO (USP), SÃO PAULO, BRAZIL.; DEPARTMENT OF PEDIATRICS, RIBEIRÃO PRETO MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF SAO PAULO, SÃO PAULO, BRAZIL.; DEPARTMENT OF OPHTHALMOLOGY, OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, AND HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DIVISION OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, RIBEIRÃO PRETO MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF SÃO PAULO (USP), SÃO PAULO, BRAZIL.; DEPARTMENT OF OPHTHALMOLOGY, OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, AND HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DIVISION OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, RIBEIRÃO PRETO MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF SÃO PAULO (USP), SÃO PAULO, BRAZIL.; DEPARTMENT OF INTERNAL MEDICINE, RIBEIRÃO PRETO MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF SÃO PAULO (USP), SÃO PAULO, BRAZIL.; DEPARTMENT OF OPHTHALMOLOGY, OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, AND HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DIVISION OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, RIBEIRÃO PRETO MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF SÃO PAULO (USP), SÃO PAULO, BRAZIL.; DEPARTMENT OF OPHTHALMOLOGY, OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, AND HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DIVISION OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, RIBEIRÃO PRETO MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF SÃO PAULO (USP), SÃO PAULO, BRAZIL.;",NA,"© 2016 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2016/09/10 06:00","20171204","20160909",2017,"2016/09/10 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.21846 [DOI]","20180110","2017/12/05 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","135-142","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"27610609","PPUBLISH","0 (BETA-LACTAMASE INHIBITORS) 74469-00-4 (AMOXICILLIN-POTASSIUM CLAVULANATE COMBINATION)","IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2017 FEB;7(2):135-142.

HOWEVER, WHEN ONLY THE TOTAL SNOT-22 SCORES ARE USED, THE PATTERN OF SYMPTOM DISTRIBUTION AND HETEROGENEITY IN PATIENT SYMPTOMS IS LOST. OBJECTIVES: TO USE A STANDARDIZED SYMPTOM ASSESSMENT TOOL (SNOT-22) ON PREOPERATIVE SYMPTOMS TO UNDERSTAND SYMPTOM HETEROGENEITY IN CRS AND TO AID IN CHARACTERIZATION OF DISTINGUISHING CLINICAL FEATURES BETWEEN SUBGROUPS. METHODS: THIS WAS A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF 97 SURGICAL PATIENTS WITH CRS. SYMPTOM-BASED CLUSTERS WERE DERIVED ON THE BASIS OF PRESURGICAL SNOT-22 SCORES USING UNSUPERVISED ANALYSIS AND NETWORK GRAPHS. COMPARISON BETWEEN CLUSTERS WAS PERFORMED FOR CLINICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS, POSTSURGICAL SYMPTOM SCORES, AND PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF A HISTORY OF ASPIRIN SENSITIVITY. RESULTS: UNSUPERVISED ANALYSIS REVEALS COCLUSTERING OF SPECIFIC SYMPTOMS IN THE SNOT-22 TOOL. USING SYMPTOM-BASED CLUSTERING, PATIENTS WITH CRS WERE STRATIFIED INTO SEVERE OVERALL (MEAN TOTAL SCORE, 90.8), SEVERE SINONASAL (SCORE, 62), MODERATE SINONASAL (SCORE, 40), MODERATE NONSINONASAL (SCORE, 37) AND MILD SINONASAL (SCORE, 16) CLUSTERS. THE LAST 2 CLUSTERS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH LACK OF HISTORY OF ASPIRIN SENSITIVITY. THE FIRST CLUSTER HAD A RAPID RELAPSE IN SYMPTOMS POSTOPERATIVELY, AND THE LAST CLUSTER DEMONSTRATED MINIMAL SYMPTOMATIC IMPROVEMENT AFTER SURGERY.

THIS IS A COMMON CAUSE OF IMPAIRED NASAL BREATHING DURING DAILY ACTIVITIES AND THERE IS ALSO AN ESTABLISHED CONNECTION BETWEEN NASAL OBSTRUCTION AND SNORING. THE CONDITION IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO TREAT, ALTHOUGH EVEN A SMALL ENLARGEMENT OF THE LUMEN AT THE NASAL VALVE CAN LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE EASE OF NASAL BREATHING. METHODS: THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROSPECTIVE STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE VIVAER SYSTEM FOR THE TREATMENT OF NARROWED NASAL VALVES AND TO MEASURE CHANGES IN THE SYMPTOMS OF NASAL OBSTRUCTION AND SNORING. THE VIVAER SYSTEM USES LOW ENERGY RADIOFREQUENCY TO REMODEL THE NASAL SIDEWALL IN ORDER TO IMPROVE AIRFLOW. RESULTS: THE STUDY INVOLVED 31 PATIENTS PRESENTING FROM 1ST SEPTEMBER 2017 TO 1ST MAY 2018 WITH SYMPTOMS OF NASAL OBSTRUCTION AND SNORING. IN ALL PATIENTS, AN IMPROVEMENT WAS OBSERVED IN NASAL BREATHING MEASURED BY NOSE SCORE, SLEEP QUALITY BY SOS QUESTIONNAIRE AND QUALITY OF LIFE AS MEASURED BY EQ-5D AND SNOT-22.

CURRENT GUIDELINES PROPOSE SUBCLASSIFICATION USING POLYP STATUS WHILE OTHERS PROPOSE USING MUCOSAL EOSINOPHILIA. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT APPROPRIATE CRS SUBCLASSIFICATION WOULD INCREASE HOMOGENEITY OF BASELINE SYMPTOMS, AND IDENTIFY CHARACTERISTIC SYMPTOMS OF EACH SUBTYPE. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 57 CRS PATIENTS UNDERGOING SURGERY PROSPECTIVELY COMPLETED A PREOPERATIVE BATTERY OF 73 QUESTIONS RELATING TO SYMPTOMS INCLUDING THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AND 29-ITEM PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES MEASUREMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PROMIS-29) GENERAL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) MEASURES. EOSINOPHILIC CATIONIC PROTEIN (ECP) LEVELS WERE DETERMINED FROM ETHMOID, UNCINATE, AND POLYP TISSUE HOMOGENATES USING ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY (ELISA) AND NORMALIZED TO TOTAL PROTEIN. PATIENTS WERE CLASSIFIED AS EOSINOPHILIC (ECRS) OR NON-EOSINOPHILIC (NECRS) USING A 95TH PERCENTILE THRESHOLD ESTABLISHED FROM CONTROL TISSUE FROM 82 PATIENTS WITHOUT CRS. SEPARATE PAIRWISE COMPARISONS WERE PERFORMED ON PATIENT-REPORTED SYMPTOMS USING POLYP AND EOSINOPHILIC STATUS. RESULTS: OF THE 57 PATIENTS, 28 HAD CRS WITH NASAL POLYPS (CRSWNP); 27 OF 57 PATIENTS HAD ECRS (CRSWNP, N = 21; CRS WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS [CRSSNP], N = 6). CRSWNP PATIENTS HAD INCREASED NEED TO BLOW NOSE, FREQUENCY OF NASAL CONGESTION, MORE SEVERE DIFFICULTY BREATHING THROUGH NOSE, MORE SEVERE NASAL DISCHARGE, BUT LESS COUGH (P < 0.05). ECRS PATIENTS HAD MORE BOTHERSOME LOSS OF TASTE/SMELL, EAR PAIN, SNEEZING, SEVERE DIFFICULTY BREATHING THROUGH NOSE, AND SEVERE NASAL CONGESTION COMPARED TO NECRS PATIENTS (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: SUBCLASSIFYING CRS WITH SYMPTOMS ALONE IS DIFFICULT WITH NEITHER POLYP STATUS NOR EOSINOPHILIA GIVING A DISTINCTIVE CLINICAL SYMPTOM PROFILE. HOWEVER, CERTAIN SYMPTOMS MAY HELP OTOLARYNGOLOGISTS IDENTIFY CRS SUBTYPES, WHICH MAY HELP GUIDE FUTURE TREATMENTS. FURTHER VALIDATION AND EVALUATION OF PROGNOSIS FOLLOWING TREATMENT IS REQUIRED TO EVALUATE APPROPRIATE MEANS OF SUBCLASSIFYING CRS.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FEINBERG SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, CHICAGO, IL.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FEINBERG SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, CHICAGO, IL.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FEINBERG SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, CHICAGO, IL.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FEINBERG SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, CHICAGO, IL.; DIVISION OF ALLERGY-IMMUNOLOGY, DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FEINBERG SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, CHICAGO, IL.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FEINBERG SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, CHICAGO, IL.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FEINBERG SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, CHICAGO, IL.; DIVISION OF ALLERGY-IMMUNOLOGY, DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FEINBERG SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, CHICAGO, IL.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FEINBERG SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, CHICAGO, IL.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FEINBERG SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, CHICAGO, IL.;",NA,"© 2015 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,"NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST","2015/12/20 06:00","20171108","20151218",2016,"2015/12/20 06:00",NA,NA,"P01 AI106683/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/UNITED STATES R01 HL078860/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/UNITED STATES UL1 TR000150/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/UNITED STATES U19 AI106683/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/UNITED STATES R01 HL068546/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/UNITED STATES UL1 TR001422/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/UNITED STATES R01 AI072570/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/UNITED STATES K23 DC012067/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/UNITED STATES K12 HS023011/HS/AHRQ HHS/UNITED STATES R37 HL068546/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/UNITED STATES","5",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (PRINT) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.21687 [DOI]","20181113","2017/11/09 06:00","NIHMS734580",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","500-7",NA,"PMC4856570",NA,"26683389","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2016 MAY;6(5):500-7.

THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) QUALITY-OF-LIFE TOOL INCLUDES TWO QUESTIONS THAT SPECIFICALLY SCREEN FOR SYMPTOMS OF ET DYSFUNCTION (EAR FULLNESS; EAR PAIN). OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE ET SYMPTOMS WERE PRESENT IN PATIENTS WITH CRS, AND WHETHER THESE SYMPTOMS RESPOND TO ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS). METHODOLOGY: SNOT-22 DATA COLLECTED PROSPECTIVELY AT TIME OF RECRUITMENT INTO IRB-APPROVED CLINICAL TRIALS OR CASE-CONTROL STUDIES IN CRS WAS POOLED TO PROVIDE A CROSS SECTION OF THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF ET DYSFUNCTION. WHEN APPLICABLE TO THE TRIALS, THE SNOT-22 WAS REPEATED AT LEAST 3 MONTHS FOLLOWING ESS. RESULTS: FIVE TRIALS RENDERING 131 PATIENTS WERE AVAILABLE FOR ASSESSMENT. THE CONTROL GROUP COMPRISED OF 251 PARTICIPANTS FROM TWO CASE-CONTROL STUDIES. EAR FULLNESS OF EQUAL/GREATHER THAN 1 WAS REPORTED IN 80/131 CRS PATIENTS COMPARED TO 45/251 CONTROL PATIENTS. EAR PAIN OF EQUAL/GREATHER THAN 1 WAS REPORTED IN 39/131 CRS PATIENTS COMPARED TO 33/251 CONTROL PATIENTS. FOLLOWING ESS, MEAN EAR FULLNESS AND EAR PAIN SCORES DECREASED TO 1.17 AND 0.73, RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSION: SYMPTOMS SUGGESTIVE OF ET DYSFUNCTION ARE FREQUENT IN CRS, AND FOR MOST PATIENTS THE SYMPTOMS WILL DECREASE POST-ESS TO A LEVEL COMPARABLE WITH A NON-CRS POPULATION.

THERE IS ONGOING EVIDENCE OF THE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECT OF LONG-TERM MACROLIDE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH CRS. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF LONG-TERM CONSUMPTION OF LOW-DOSE AZITHROMYCIN AFTER FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY. METHODS: SIXTY-SIX PATIENTS WHO FULFILLED THE INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS. THE SUBJECTS RECEIVED THE STANDARD CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT (FLUTICASONE NASAL SPRAY PLUS NORMAL SALINE SOLUTION IRRIGATION) OR THE CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT PLUS 250 MG OF AZITHROMYCIN ON A DAILY BASIS FOR 3 MONTHS. EVALUATION WAS MADE BASED ON THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) IMMEDIATELY BEFORE SURGERY AND 3 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY. RESULTS: THE INTERVENTION GROUP SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SNOT-22 SCORES AFTER THE TREATMENT AND A HIGHER PERCENTAGE CHANGE AFTER 3 MONTHS OF THERAPY COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. A SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE OF SNOT-22 SCORES AND SMOKING IN THE PLACEBO GROUP. LUND-MACKAY SCORES, PATIENT AGE, AND THE DURATION OF SYMPTOMS HAD NO SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION WITH THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE. CONCLUSION: TREATMENT WITH LONG-TERM LOW-DOSE AZITHROMYCIN IN COMBINATION WITH THE CONVENTIONAL THERAPY COULD STATISTICALLY REDUCE THE RECURRENCE RATE OF CRS SYMPTOMS AFTER FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY, BUT THERE WAS NOT SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF AZITHROMYCIN AT THE INVESTIGATED DOSE. FURTHER LARGER SCALE TRIALS, ALONG WITH A LONGER FOLLOW-UP PERIOD, IS NEEDED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE THERAPY.","OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY HEAD AND NECK SURGERY DEPARTMENT, OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY RESEARCH CENTER, TEHRAN UNIVERSITY OF MEDICAL SCIENCES, TEHRAN, IRAN.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015/12/06 06:00","20160920",NA,2015,"2015/12/08 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"6",NA,"1945-8932 (ELECTRONIC) 1945-8932 (LINKING)","101490775","AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RHINOLOGY & ALLERGY","ENG","10.2500/AJRA.2015.29.4244 [DOI]","20151205","2016/09/22 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","421-4","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"26637580","PPUBLISH","0 (ANTI-BACTERIAL AGENTS) 83905-01-5 (AZITHROMYCIN)","IM",NA,"AM J RHINOL ALLERGY. 2015 NOV-DEC;29(6):421-4.

WE HAVE RECENTLY DESCRIBED A HANDHELD SPIRAL PUNCH TO CREATE MINIMALLY INVASIVE ETHMOID PUNCH SINUSOTOMY (EPS) SITES INTO THE ETHMOID BULLA AND BASAL LAMELLA, WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IRRIGANT ACCESS TO THE ETHMOID SINUSES IN CADAVER MODELS. HERE, WE CONDUCTED A CLINICAL FEASIBILITY STUDY TO DETERMINE THE INITIAL SAFETY EVALUATION OF EPS IN CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITHOUT POLYPOSIS (CRSSNP) PATIENTS WITH ACTIVE ETHMOID DISEASE. STUDY DESIGN: SINGLE-ARM, INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD-APPROVED OBSERVATIONAL STUDY. METHODS: THIS STUDY WAS PERFORMED IN CRSSNP PATIENTS WHO FAILED MEDICAL MANAGEMENT; WERE CANDIDATES FOR STANDARD, TRADITIONAL FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY; AND WERE OFFERED THE OPTION OF EPS. EPS CHARACTERISTICS (PATENCY, REMUCOSALIZATION) AND COMPLICATIONS (CLOSURE, MUCUS RECIRCULATION) WERE COLLECTED. ALTERATIONS IN RADIOGRAPHIC DISEASE AND SYMPTOMS AFTER EPS WERE DETERMINED BY LUND MACKAY (LM) SCORING AND 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORING, WHICH WAS COLLECTED UP TO 6 MONTHS POST-PROCEDURE. RESULTS: THIRTY-TWO OF 40 POSSIBLE ETHMOID COMPARTMENTS (17 OF 20 ANTERIOR, 15 OF 20 POSTERIOR) UNDERWENT EPS. TWENTY-NINE OF 32 EPS SITES REMAINED PATENT (N = 29, 90.6%), WITH A MINORITY DISPLAYING EVIDENCE OF RESTENOSIS (N = 9, 28.1%) OR CLOSURE (N = 3, 9.3%). ALL PATENT EPS SITES HAD COMPLETE REMUCOSALIZATION (N = 29, 100%) WITH NO EVIDENCE OF MUCUS RECIRCULATION (N = 0, 0%) OR OTHER COMPLICATIONS SECONDARY TO HEALING OR DEVICE USE. ETHMOID SINUS CAVITIES WITH A PRE-EPS LM SCORE OF 1 OR 2 UNIVERSALLY IMPROVED TO AN LM SCORE OF 0 FOLLOWING EPS (N = 30 OF 30, 100%). SNOT-22 SCORES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED, WITH A MEAN REDUCTION OF 33.1 (49.6 ± 7.5 PRE-EPS VS 16.5 ± 7.7 POST-EPS, P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: THIS FEASIBILITY STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT EPS APPEARS TO BE A SAFE, MINIMALLY INVASIVE PROCEDURE TO TREAT ETHMOID SINUSITIS IN CRSSNP PATIENTS UNRESPONSIVE TO MEDICAL THERAPY THAT ESTABLISHES ETHMOID VENTILATION, AND LIKELY IMPROVES EFFECTIVE SINUS IRRIGATION.

DUE TO THESE FACTORS, THIS APPROACH MAY AFFECT THE RATES OF POSTOPERATIVE RHINOSINUSITIS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DEFINE THE RATES OF POSTOPERATIVE RHINOSINUSITIS IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING THIS APPROACH. METHODS: SINGLE INSTITUTION, RETROSPECTIVE CHART REVIEW OF PATIENTS UNDERGOING TSH FROM 2005 TO 2018. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 415 PATIENTS WERE IDENTIFIED AND 14% DEVELOPED AN EPISODE OF POSTOPERATIVE RHINOSINUSITIS WITHIN 3 MONTHS. THESE PATIENTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO HAVE HAD A HISTORY OF RECURRENT ACUTE OR CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS. MOST CASES WERE SPHENOETHMOIDAL SINUSITIS MANAGED WITH 1 TO 2 COURSES OF ANTIBIOTICS. OF PATIENTS WITH POSTOPERATIVE RHINOSINUSITIS, MOST DID NOT UNDERGO NSF. AVERAGE FOLLOW-UP WAS 38 MONTHS. SIX PATIENTS (1.4%) UNDERWENT POST-TSH FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (FESS). AVERAGE TIME FROM TSH TO FESS WAS 26.3 MONTHS. TWO OF THESE PATIENTS HAD A HISTORY OF PRIOR CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITHOUT POLYPOSIS.

IMMUNOLOGICAL CHANGES DURING ACUTE EXACERBATION OF CRS MAY PROVIDE VALUABLE CLUES TO THE PATHOGENESIS AND PERPETUATION OF THE DISEASE. OBJECTIVE: TO CHARACTERIZE LOCAL AND SYSTEMIC IMMUNE RESPONSES ASSOCIATED WITH ACUTE WORSENING OF SINONASAL SYMPTOMS DURING EXACERBATION IN CRS WITH NASAL POLYPS (CRSWNP) COMPARED TO CONTROLS. METHODS: THIS WAS A NON-INTERVENTIONAL PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF INDIVIDUALS WITH CRSWNP AND NORMAL CONTROLS. SUBJECTS UNDERWENT A BASELINE VISIT WITH COLLECTION OF NASAL SECRETIONS, NASAL WASHES, AND SERUM SPECIMENS. WITHIN 3 DAYS OF ACUTE WORSENING OF SINONASAL SYMPTOMS, SUBJECTS UNDERWENT A STUDY VISIT, FOLLOWED BY A POST-VISIT 2 WEEKS LATER. THE SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22) SCORES AND IMMUNOLOGICAL PARAMETERS IN THE SPECIMENS WERE ANALYSED USING A NOVEL, UNSUPERVISED LEARNING METHOD AND BY CONVENTIONAL UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS. RESULTS: BOTH CRSWNP PATIENTS AND CONTROL SUBJECTS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SNOT-22 SCORES DURING ACUTE EXACERBATION. INCREASED NASAL LEVELS OF IL-6, IL-5, AND EOSINOPHIL MAJOR BASIC PROTEIN WERE OBSERVED IN CRSWNP PATIENTS. A NETWORK ANALYSIS OF SERUM SPECIMENS REVEALED CHANGES IN A SET OF IMMUNOLOGICAL PARAMETERS, WHICH ARE DISTINCTLY ASSOCIATED WITH CRSWNP BUT NOT WITH CONTROLS. IN PARTICULAR, SYSTEMIC INCREASES IN VEGF AND GM-CSF LEVELS WERE NOTABLE AND WERE VALIDATED BY A CONVENTIONAL ANALYSIS. CONCLUSIONS: CRSWNP PATIENTS DEMONSTRATE DISTINCT IMMUNOLOGICAL CHANGES LOCALLY AND SYSTEMICALLY DURING ACUTE EXACERBATION.

ONLY FEMALE GENDER ASSOCIATED WITH THE TOTAL SNOT-22 SCORE (P = 0.004), WHEREAS ONLY LUND-MACKAY SCORE ASSOCIATED WITH THE NASAL SUBSET SCORE (P = 0.015). ALLERGIC RHINITIS ONLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE OTOLOGIC SUBSET SCORE (P = 0.005), WHEREAS ONLY ASTHMA ASSOCIATED WITH THE EMOTIONAL FUNCTION SUBSET SCORE (P = 0.027). NONE OF THE MEASURED COVARIATES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SLEEP SUBSET SCORE. CONCLUSION: VARIABILITY IN SNOT-22 SCORES FROM CRS PATIENTS MAY BE EXPLAINED BY THE INDEPENDENT PRESENCE OF SLEEP, NASAL, OTOLOGIC, AND EMOTIONAL FUNCTION SYMPTOMS, WITH WHICH WE FIND NOVEL CLINICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC ASSOCIATIONS.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE QOL IN THE 2 YEARS FOLLOWING ENDOSCOPIC MALIGNANT TUMOR RESECTION. METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY WAS PERFORMED, INCLUDING PATIENTS WITH BOTH MALIGNANT AND BENIGN SINONASAL TUMORS IN A TERTIARY ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER. PATIENTS UNDERGOING ENDOSCOPIC TUMOR RESECTION WHO HAD COMPLETED SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST 22 (SNOT-22) QUESTIONNAIRES WERE INCLUDED IN THE COHORT.

GIVEN THAT RHINOSINUSITIS IS THE LEADING CONDITION ACCOUNTING FOR ANTIBIOTIC PRESCRIPTIONS IN THE AMBULATORY SETTING, WE AIMED TO EVALUATE CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER ANTIBIOTIC USE IN CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS). METHODS: ADULT CRS PATIENTS ENROLLED IN A PROSPECTIVE, MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL, OBSERVATIONAL COHORT STUDY EVALUATING TREATMENT OUTCOMES WERE INCLUDED IN THIS ANALYSIS. STUDY PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO REPORT THE NUMBER OF DAYS OUT OF THE PREVIOUS 90 DAYS THAT SYSTEMIC ANTIBIOTICS WERE TAKEN FOR SINUS DISEASE. PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS, DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS, AND MEASURES OF DISEASE SEVERITY WERE EVALUATED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 561 PATIENTS FROM 4 INSTITUTIONS WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS, WITH MEAN ANTIBIOTIC USE OF 17.4 ± 22.4 OUT OF THE PRIOR 90 DAYS. NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ANTIBIOTIC-USE GROUPS WERE FOUND FOR OBJECTIVE MEASURES OF DISEASE SEVERITY (COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY [CT], ENDOSCOPY, BRIEF SMELL IDENTIFICATION TEST [BSIT] SCORES), HOWEVER, INCREASED PATIENT-REPORTED SYMPTOM BURDEN (22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST [SNOT-22], RHINOSINUSITIS DISABILITY INDEX [RSDI]) WAS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE ANTIBIOTIC USE. PATIENTS REPORTING THE MOST ANTIBIOTIC USE WERE OLDER (P = 0.004) BUT NO ETHNIC OR GENDER DIFFERENCES WERE SEEN. COMORBID DIAGNOSES OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA, DIABETES, DEPRESSION, OR FIBROMYALGIA WERE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED ANTIBIOTIC USE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH LITERATURE RECOMMENDATIONS, CRS WITH NASAL POLYPS (CRSWNP) PATIENTS WERE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE USED ANTIBIOTICS. ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS) SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED ANTIBIOTIC USE. CONCLUSION: VARIABILITY IN ANTIBIOTIC USE IN CRS APPEARS TO BE DRIVEN BY SYMPTOM BURDEN, INDEPENDENT OF OBJECTIVE MEASURES OF DISEASE SEVERITY, PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS, AND PRESENCE OF COMORBID DISEASE.

ALONG WITH ITS CHRONIC DISEASE BURDEN IT CREATES HIGH SOCIETAL COSTS. THERAPY CONSISTS OF LONG-TERM USE OF MEDICATION AND, IF INSUFFICIENT, ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY. NO CONSENSUS EXISTS ON THE RIGHT TIMING AND EXTENT OF DISEASE THAT WARRANTS SURGERY. FURTHERMORE, THERE IS LACK OF CLINICAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE BENEFIT OF SURGERY OVER MEDICATION ONLY. THE CURRENT TRIAL EVALUATES THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY IN ADDITION TO DRUG TREATMENT VERSUS MEDICATION EXCLUSIVELY IN THE ADULT PATIENT GROUP WITH NASAL POLYPS. METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE, MULTICENTRE, SUPERIORITY, RANDOMISED CONTROLLED (POLYPESS) TRIAL IN 238 PATIENTS AGED 18 YEARS OR OLDER SELECTED FOR PRIMARY OR REVISION ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY BY THE OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGIST WAS DESIGNED. PATIENTS WILL BE RANDOMISED TO EITHER ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY IN ADDITION TO MEDICATION OR MEDICAL THERAPY ONLY. RELEVANT DATA WILL BE COLLECTED PRIOR TO RANDOMISATION, AT BASELINE AND 3, 6, 12, 18 AND 24 MONTHS AFTER START OF TREATMENT. COMPLETE FOLLOW-UP WILL BE 24 MONTHS. PRIMARY OUTCOME IS DISEASE-SPECIFIC HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE QUANTIFIED BY THE SNOT-22 AFTER 12-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. SECONDARY OUTCOMES ARE GENERIC HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, COST-EFFECTIVENESS, OBJECTIVE SIGNS OF DISEASE AND ADVERSE EFFECTS OF TREATMENT. SUBGROUP ANALYSES WILL BE PERFORMED TO VERIFY WHETHER TREATMENT EFFECTS DIFFER AMONG PATIENT PHENOTYPES. DISCUSSION: THE POLYPESS TRIAL WILL INVESTIGATE TAILORED CARE IN ADULT PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITH NASAL POLYPS AND WILL RESULT IN IMPROVED CLINICAL PATHWAYS TO HELP TO DETERMINE IN WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES TO PERFORM SURGERY.

THE STANDARD FOR PRESCRIBING BUDESONIDE IS VIA IMPREGNATED NASAL SALINE IRRIGATION (INSI), ALTHOUGH RECENTLY THE MUCOSAL ATOMIZATION DEVICE (MAD) HAS EMERGED AS A THEORETICALLY SUPERIOR METHOD OF DISTRIBUTING MEDICATION INTO THE SINUSES. THE MAD ATOMIZES MEDICATION INTO SMALL DROPLETS AND THIS IS THOUGHT TO ENHANCE ABSORPTION AND IMPROVE BIOAVAILABILITY. HOWEVER, NO STUDIES HAVE SHOWN WHETHER ENHANCED ABSORPTION AND IMPROVED BIOAVAILABILITY OF BUDESONIDE VIA MAD CAUSES ADRENAL SUPPRESSION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER BUDESONIDE VIA MAD AFFECTS THE HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL (HPA) AXIS. METHODS: TWENTY CRS PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED FROM A TERTIARY RHINOLOGY CLINIC AND RANDOMIZED TO TAKE BUDESONIDE (1 MG) VIA MAD OR VIA INSI TWICE A DAY FOR 60 DAYS.

RESULTS: THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF ADRENAL SUPPRESSION IN EITHER GROUP (N = 20) BASED ON ACTH STIMULATION TEST RESULTS NOR WAS THERE SIGNIFICANT PLASMA BUDESONIDE LEVELS DETECTED IN EITHER GROUP. QUALITY OF LIFE, AS INDICATED BY SNOT-22, DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN GROUPS AT 60 DAYS (P = 0.404; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], -37.2 TO 15.9), BUT SNOT-22 SCORES FOR PATIENTS USING MAD DID SHOW STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT AT 60 DAYS COMPARED TO BASELINE (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: THE MAD IS LIKELY A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE METHOD OF DELIVERING BUDESONIDE TO THE SINUSES IN THE SHORT TERM.","DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, NIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, ST.; PAUL'S SINUS CENTRE, VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA.;",NA,"© 2014 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2014/01/23 06:00","20150416","20140121",2014,"2014/01/23 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"5",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.21280 [DOI]","20181202","2015/04/17 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","397-402","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"24449682","PPUBLISH","0 (ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENTS) 51333-22-3 (BUDESONIDE) WI4X0X7BPJ (HYDROCORTISONE)","IM","CLINICALTRIALS.GOV/NCT01405339","INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2014 MAY;4(5):397-402.

STUDY DESIGN: INDIVIDUAL COHORT STUDY. METHODS: A STUDY WAS PERFORMED OF PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP WHO UNDERWENT ESS FROM JULY 2015 TO MAY 2016 AT A TERTIARY REFERRAL MEDICAL CENTER. THE MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES WERE SUBJECTIVE IMPROVEMENT IN PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES, USING THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AND 10-ITEM VOICE HANDICAP INDEX (VHI-10). RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 50 PATIENTS (AGE 47.9 YEARS; 48% FEMALE), 66% REVISION AND 34% PRIMARY, WERE AVAILABLE AT A FOLLOW-UP OF 3 MONTHS.

STUDY DESIGN: PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL COHORT STUDY, METHODS: PATIENTS ELECTING ESS IN 87 UK HOSPITALS WERE ENROLLED. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS CHANGE IN SNOT-22 SCORE 3 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY. PATIENTS WERE CATEGORIZED ACCORDING TO BASELINE SNOT-22 SCORE, AND THE PROPORTION OF PATIENTS ACHIEVING A SNOT-22 MINIMAL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE (MCID) OF 8.9 WAS CALCULATED, AS WELL AS THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN SNOT-22 SCORE. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 2,263 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED WITHIN THIS STUDY. THERE WAS AN AVERAGE 40% REDUCTION IN SNOT-22 SCORES FOLLOWING SURGERY, AND 66% OF PATIENTS OVERALL ACHIEVED THE MCID. THE PROPORTION OF PATIENTS ACHIEVING THE MCID INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH INCREASING BASELINE SNOT-22. PATIENTS WITH A PREOPERATIVE SCORE OF <20 FAILED TO ACHIEVE A MEAN IMPROVEMENT GREATER THAN THE MCID. PATIENTS WITH A SCORE OF >30 HAD A GREATER THAN 70% CHANCE OF ACHIEVING THE MCID. CRS PATIENTS WITH POLYPS HAD GREATER IMPROVEMENT THAN PATIENTS WITH CRS WITHOUT POLYPS. THE PREDICTIVE VALUE OF THE SNOT-22 IS SIMILAR IN THE UK COHORT, ALTHOUGH OVERALL PATIENTS DID NOT BENEFIT FROM SURGERY AS MUCH AS THEIR NORTH AMERICAN COUNTERPARTS.

THE CHOICE OF TREATMENT IN PRACTICE, HOWEVER, ALSO CONSIDERS THE PATIENT'S DECISION. OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS THE LONG-TERM QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WHO DECIDED TO AVOID SURGERY. METHODS: THIS IS A PROSPECTIVE LONGITUDINAL STUDY WITH A GROUP OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS, WITH AND WITHOUT INDICATION FOR SURGERY, WITH APPLICATION OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE SNOT-22 IN TWO PERIODS: BETWEEN 2011 AND 2012 AND BETWEEN JUNE AND AUGUST 2016, VIA EMAIL. RESULTS: DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 42 PATIENTS, OF WHICH 13 PRESENTED INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY AND 29 WERE NOT INDICATED FOR SURGERY. THE AVERAGE QUALITY OF LIFE SCORE WAS 42.1 (±16.4) IN THE GROUP WITH AN INDICATION FOR SURGERY AND 40.6 (±23.4) IN THE GROUP WITHOUT THIS INDICATION, P=0.84. ALL THE PATIENTS WERE ASSESSED BY A SINGLE DOCTOR WITH BLINDING IN RELATION TO THE INITIAL SCORE. NO DIFFERENCES WERE DETECTED BETWEEN THE GROUPS. THE IMPACT OF THE CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WAS REDUCED EVEN AMONG THE PATIENTS WITH THE INDICATION FOR SURGERY. BOTH GROUPS SCORED OVER 40. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY CAN HELP PREDICT THE IMPACT OF THE CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS OVER TIME AND BETTER ADJUST EXPECTATIONS WITH NON-SURGICAL TREATMENT.","INSTITUTO DE OTORRINOLARINGOLOGIA OTORRINOS ASSOCIADOS (INOOA), SALVADOR, BA, BRAZIL.; ESCOLA BAHIANA DE MEDICINA E SAÚDE PÚBLICA, SALVADOR, BA, BRAZIL.; INSTITUTO DE OTORRINOLARINGOLOGIA OTORRINOS ASSOCIADOS (INOOA), SALVADOR, BA, BRAZIL.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: HELDERMACARIO@GMAIL.;COM.; INSTITUTO DE OTORRINOLARINGOLOGIA OTORRINOS ASSOCIADOS (INOOA), SALVADOR, BA, BRAZIL.; ESCOLA BAHIANA DE MEDICINA E SAÚDE PÚBLICA, SALVADOR, BA, BRAZIL.; INSTITUTO DE OTORRINOLARINGOLOGIA OTORRINOS ASSOCIADOS (INOOA), SALVADOR, BA, BRAZIL.; INSTITUTO DE OTORRINOLARINGOLOGIA OTORRINOS ASSOCIADOS (INOOA), SALVADOR, BA, BRAZIL.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT © 2018 ASSOCIAÇÃO BRASILEIRA DE OTORRINOLARINGOLOGIA E CIRURGIA CÉRVICO-FACIAL.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DESCRIBE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ONLINE MODEL FOR COLLECTION OF CLINICAL OUTCOMES DATA IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS). METHODS: PATIENTS COMPLETED THE SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), CHRONIC SINUSITIS SURVEY (CSS), AND EUROQOL 5-DIMENSION ASSESSMENT (EQ-5D), BEFORE AND AFTER SINUS SURGERY. ONE YEAR AFTER INITIAL PATIENT ENROLLMENT, AN ONLINE TOOL WAS DEVELOPED TO FACILITATE COLLECTION OF POSTOPERATIVE DATA. RESPONSE RATES PREIMPLEMENTATION AND POSTIMPLEMENTATION OF ONLINE DATA COLLECTION WERE COMPARED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 520 SINUS SURGERY PATIENTS PROVIDED OUTCOMES DATA FROM THE PRACTICES OF 7 PRIVATE PRACTICE (N = 308) AND 4 ACADEMIC OTOLARYNGOLOGISTS (N = 212). WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ONLINE COLLECTION INSTRUMENT, THE RESPONSE RATE AT 3 MONTHS INCREASED FROM 67% TO 78.8% (P = 0.004).

DEBATE EXISTS AS TO THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOPICAL THERAPY IN CRS. METHODS: THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO DETERMINE IF CORTICOSTEROID DELIVERED VIA A NASAL IRRIGATION OR VIA A SIMPLE NASAL SPRAY WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN CONTROLLING THE SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS OF CRS. A DOUBLE-BLIND PLACEBO-CONTROLLED RANDOMIZED TRIAL OVER 12 MONTHS WAS PERFORMED BETWEEN 3 TERTIARY RHINOLOGIC CLINICS. AFTER SINUS SURGERY, ALL PATIENTS PERFORMED A NASAL IRRIGATION FOLLOWED BY A NASAL SPRAY ONCE A DAY FOR 12 MONTHS. GROUPS WERE DEFINED BY CORTICOSTEROID (2 MG MOMETASONE) DELIVERED BY EITHER SPRAY OR IRRIGATION. THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE PATIENT-REPORTED SYMPTOMS: VISUAL ANALOGUE SCORE (VAS) AND 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), A GLOBAL RATING OF SINONASAL FUNCTION. SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE ALSO RECORDED FROM RADIOLOGY (LUND-MACKAY SCORE [LMS]) AND ENDOSCOPIC (MODIFIED LUND-KENNEDY SCORE [MLKS]) ASSESSMENTS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 44 PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED (AGE 50.3 ± 13.0 YEARS; 40.9% FEMALE). OVERALL, PATIENTS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM EITHER INTERVENTION. HOWEVER, THE CORTICOSTEROID NASAL IRRIGATION GROUP HAD GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN NASAL BLOCKAGE (-69.91 ± 29.37 VS -36.12 ± 42.94; P = 0.029), A GREATER IMPROVEMENT ON LMS (-12.07 ± 4.43 VS -7.39 ± 6.94; P = 0.031) AND LESS INFLAMMATION ON MLKS AT 12 MONTHS (7.33 ± 11.55 VS 21.78 ± 23.37; P = 0.018). ONE-YEAR POSTTREATMENT BLOCKAGE, DRAINAGE, FEVER, AND TOTAL VAS SCORES WERE ALL LOWER IN THE CORTICOSTEROID IRRIGATION GROUP. CONCLUSION: IN THE SETTING OF DIFFUSE OR PATCHY CRS DISEASE, THE USE OF CORTICOSTEROID DELIVERED BY NASAL IRRIGATION IS SUPERIOR TO SIMPLE NASAL SPRAY IN POSTSURGICAL PATIENTS.","RHINOLOGY AND SKULL BASE RESEARCH GROUP, ST VINCENT'S CENTRE FOR APPLIED MEDICAL RESEARCH, UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.; FACULTY OF MEDICINE AND HEALTH SCIENCES, MACQUARIE UNIVERSITY, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.; FACULTY OF MEDICINE AND HEALTH SCIENCES, MACQUARIE UNIVERSITY, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, FACULTY OF MEDICINE, CHULALONGKORN UNIVERSITY, BANGKOK, THAILAND.; SYDNEY MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, CONCORD GENERAL HOSPITAL, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.; RHINOLOGY AND SKULL BASE RESEARCH GROUP, ST VINCENT'S CENTRE FOR APPLIED MEDICAL RESEARCH, UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF UTAH, SALT LAKE CITY, UT.; FACULTY OF MEDICINE AND HEALTH SCIENCES, MACQUARIE UNIVERSITY, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.; SYDNEY MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, CONCORD GENERAL HOSPITAL, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.;",NA,"© 2018 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2018/02/03 06:00","20190408","20180202",2018,"2018/02/03 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"4",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.22093 [DOI]","20190408","2019/04/09 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","461-470","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"29394004","PPUBLISH","0 (ADRENAL CORTEX HORMONES) 0 (NASAL SPRAYS) 0 (PLACEBOS)","IM","ANZCTR/ACTRN12612000866808","INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2018 APR;8(4):461-470.

CAUSES OF THESE GENDER-BASED DIFFERENCES WARRANTED FURTHER STUDY. OBJECTIVES: TO STUDY GENDER DIFFERENCES IN ANOTHER COHORT OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH CRS WHO UNDERWENT ESS AND TO COMPARE KEY HISTOPATHOLOGIC AND SEROLOGIC FEATURES METHODS: PATIENTS WITH CRS WHO UNDERWENT ESS (FROM 2011 TO 2014) WITH STRUCTURED HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORTS ON SURGICAL SAMPLES WERE STUDIED. THE 13-ITEM STRUCTURED HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT DETAILED KEY METRICS OF INFLAMMATION AND THE PRESENCE OF FUNGAL ELEMENTS. CLINICAL, 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORE, LUND-MACKAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) SCORE, SEROLOGIC (IMMUNOGLOBULIN E [IGE] LEVEL, ABSOLUTE EOSINOPHIL COUNT) AND HISTOPATHOLOGIC DATA WERE COMPARED BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE PATIENTS BY USING STATISTICAL SOFTWARE. RESULTS: WE STUDIED 130 ELIGIBLE SUBJECTS (MEAN AGE, 54.7 YEARS; 49.2% WOMEN). COMPARED WITH THE MEN, THE WOMEN HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PREOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORES (WOMEN, 48.7; MEN 38.0 [P = 0.004]) BUT SIMILAR CT SCORES. SERUM IGE LEVELS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AMONG WOMEN VERSUS MEN (PEAK, 433.3 VERSUS 190.8 KU/L [P = 0.03]; CLOSEST TO SURGERY, 435.0 VERSUS 190.8 KU/L [P = 0.03]). TISSUE FUNGAL ELEMENTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PREVALENT IN WOMEN VERSUS MEN (19.0 VERSUS 5.2%; P = 0.02). UP TO THIS POINT, THE ANALYSIS WAS AGNOSTIC OF CLINICAL DETAILS OF THE SUBJECTS. FURTHER ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED REGARDING CLINICAL FEATURES. ALLERGIC FUNGAL SINUSITIS (AFS) WAS FOUND SIGNIFICANTLY MORE COMMONLY IN THE FEMALE VERSUS MALE PATIENTS (21.9 VERSUS 9.1%; P = 0.04). WOMEN VERSUS MEN HAD A HIGHER PREVALENCE OF MIGRAINE (19.4 VERSUS 4.6%; P = 0.01) OR ANY PRIMARY HEADACHE DISORDERS (23.0 VERSUS 6.2%; P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: WOMEN WHO UNDERWENT ESS FOR CRS HAD HIGHER SNOT-22 SYMPTOM BURDEN. WORSENED SYMPTOMATOLOGY MAY BE SECONDARY TO A HIGHER PREVALENCE OF PRIMARY HEADACHE DISORDERS IN WOMEN. HOWEVER, SURGEONS SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT FEMALE PATIENTS WITH CRS WHO SEEK ESS MAY HAVE A HIGHER PREVALENCE OF SEVERE DISEASE ENDOTYPES (MORE TISSUE FUNGAL ELEMENTS, ELEVATED SERUM IGE LEVELS) AND PHENOTYPES.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MAYO CLINIC IN ARIZONA, PHOENIX, ARIZONA, USA.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017/11/11 06:00","20180808",NA,2017,"2017/11/11 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"6",NA,"1945-8932 (ELECTRONIC) 1945-8932 (LINKING)","101490775","AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RHINOLOGY & ALLERGY","ENG","10.2500/AJRA.2017.31.4471 [DOI]","20180808","2018/08/09 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","370-375","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"29122081","PPUBLISH","37341-29-0 (IMMUNOGLOBULIN E)","IM",NA,"AM J RHINOL ALLERGY. 2017 NOV 1;31(6):370-375.

FIVE-YEAR OUTCOMES WILL BE REPORTED, AND WE WILL REVISIT A PREVIOUS ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EXTENSIVE SURGERY IN THE TREATMENT OF NASAL POLYPOSIS. METHODS: BASELINE CLINICAL DATA WAS COLLECTED FOR 3,128 PATIENTS UNDERGOING SURGERY FOR CRS (WITH OR WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS). OUTCOMES ARE DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF THE PROPORTION OF PATIENTS UNDERGOING REVISION SURGERY AND MEAN SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 1,459 (52.2%) PATIENTS RESPONDED TO 5-YEAR FOLLOW-UP. REVISION SURGERY RATES INCREASED AT EACH TIME POINT. OF THE PATIENTS RESPONDING, 279 PATIENTS (19.1%) HAD UNDERGONE FURTHER SURGERY DURING THE 5 YEARS SINCE THEIR ORIGINAL OPERATION. OF THE PATIENTS WITH POLYPS, 20.6% HAD UNDERGONE REVISION COMPARED TO 15.5% OF PATIENTS WITH CRS ALONE. THE MEAN SNOT-22 SCORE FOR ALL PATIENTS WAS 28.2 (STANDARD DEVIATION [SD] = 22.4) AT 5 YEARS AFTER SURGERY. THIS IS REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO THE RESULTS OBSERVED AT 3 MONTHS (25.5), 12 MONTHS (27.7), AND 36 MONTHS (27.7), AND REPRESENTS A 14-POINT IMPROVEMENT OVER THE BASELINE SCORE. POLYP PATIENTS REPORT BETTER SNOT-22 SCORES AT 5 YEARS (MEAN = 26.2; SD = 21.6) THAN PATIENTS WITH CRS ALONE (MEAN = 33.3; SD = 23.7). OF THE PATIENTS WHO HAD ORIGINALLY RECEIVED SIMPLE POLYPECTOMY, 21.2% HAD UNDERGONE REVISION SURGERY COMPARED TO 20.0% OF PATIENTS WHO HAD ALSO RECEIVED ADDITIONAL SINUS SURGERY. THE DIFFERENCE IN UNADJUSTED REVISION SURGERY RATES IS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (CHI(2) = 0.22; P = .64). HOWEVER, THE DIFFERENCE BECOMES STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT WHEN A MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION IS USED TO ADJUST FOR BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS, WITH PATIENTS UNDERGOING ADDITIONAL SINUS SURGERY BEING LESS LIKELY TO UNDERGO FURTHER SURGERY WITHIN THE STUDY PERIOD (ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO = 0.66; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: WE HAVE SHOWN SINONASAL SURGERY TO BE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH CRS OVER A 5-YEAR PERIOD. THE REDUCTION IN SYMPTOMS IS LARGE, WITH NO SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN SYMPTOMATIC IMPROVEMENT FROM 12 TO 60 MONTHS POSTSURGERY. HOWEVER, REVISION SURGERY RATES APPROACH 20% OVER THIS TIME, AND PATIENTS SHOULD BE COUNSELED ACCORDINGLY PRIOR TO SURGERY.","EAR, NOSE AND THROAT DEPARTMENT, GUYS AND ST.; THOMAS' HOSPITAL , LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM.; CLAIREHOPKINS@YAHOO.;COM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2009/09/26 06:00","20100105",NA,2009,"2009/09/26 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"12",NA,"1531-4995 (ELECTRONIC) 0023-852X (LINKING)","8607378","THE LARYNGOSCOPE","ENG","10.1002/LARY.20653 [DOI]","20151119","2010/01/06 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","2459-65","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"19780032","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"LARYNGOSCOPE. 2009 DEC;119(12):2459-65.

EXISTING CONTROL INSTRUMENTS ARE LIMITED IN THEIR CORRELATION TO PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES, THE NEED FOR ENDOSCOPY, OR LACK OF VALIDATION FROM A MULTIDISCIPLINARY GROUP. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEVELOP A PATIENT-BASED SINUS CONTROL TEST (SCT) FOR DETERMINING CRS CONTROL. METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW AND FOCUS GROUPS CONSISTING OF 20 PATIENTS AND 11 MEDICAL EXPERTS IN CRS FROM VARIOUS MEDICAL SPECIALTIES WERE USED TO GENERATE ITEMS. A DRAFT 13-ITEM QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ADMINISTERED TO 50 PATIENTS WITH CRS IN A PROSPECTIVE FASHION. PATIENTS WERE EVALUATED USING THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) INSTRUMENT, LUND-MACKAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) SCORE, AND LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPY SCORE. A RHINOLOGIST BLINDED TO THE QUESTIONNAIRE RESULTS ALSO PROVIDED AN OVERALL CONTROL OF THE DISEASE FOR EACH PATIENT. A REGRESSION MODEL WAS GENERATED TO IDENTIFY WHICH SUBSET OF ITEMS SHOWED THE GREATEST DISCRIMINATE ABILITY IN RELATION TO SPECIALIST'S AND PATIENT'S GLOBAL RATING OF DISEASE CONTROL. RESULTS: FOUR QUESTIONS WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL QUESTIONNAIRE (P < 0.05), EACH WITH A SCALE OF 0 TO 4, WITH AN OVERALL TOTAL SCORE RANGING FROM 0 TO 16. OPTIMAL CLASSIFICATION RESULTED IN PATIENTS WITH A SCORE FROM 1 TO 3 (WELL CONTROLLED), 4 TO 11 (PARTIALLY CONTROLLED), AND 12 TO 16 (UNCONTROLLED). SCT SCORES CORRECTLY CLASSIFIED CONTROL LEVELS 72% OF THE TIME WHEN COMPARED TO PHYSICIAN'S ASSESSMENT. CONCLUSION: THE SCT IS A SIMPLE, PATIENT GENERATED QUESTIONNAIRE THAT CAN MEASURE THE CONTROL OF CRS WITHOUT REQUIREMENT OF ENDOSCOPY OR CT EVALUATION.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO, TORONTO, ON, CANADA.; DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY DIVISION, MCMASTER UNIVERSITY, HAMILTON, ON, CANADA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY, NASHVILLE, TN.; DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY DIVISION, MCMASTER UNIVERSITY, HAMILTON, ON, CANADA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN, MILWAUKEE, WI.; DEPARTMENT OF PEDIATRICS, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO, TORONTO, ON, CANADA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY, CALGARY, AB, CANADA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, OREGON HEALTH AND SCIENCE UNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OR.; DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY DIVISION, MCMASTER UNIVERSITY, HAMILTON, ON, CANADA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, OREGON HEALTH AND SCIENCE UNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OR.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SC.;",NA,"© 2015 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2015/12/20 06:00","20171108","20151218",2016,"2015/12/20 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"5",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.21690 [DOI]","20171108","2017/11/09 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","491-9","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"26683532","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2016 MAY;6(5):491-9.

DESIGN: A PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMISED, NON-BLINDED, CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED. SETTING: THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT AT THE DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, TAMPERE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, FINLAND. PARTICIPANTS: ADULT PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMATIC ISOLATED CHRONIC OR RECURRENT RHINOSINUSITIS WITHOUT SEVERE FINDINGS IN THE SINUSES, AS DOCUMENTED IN THE SINUS' COMPUTER TOMOGRAPHY SCAN AND CLINICAL EXAMINATION, WERE RANDOMISED INTO TWO GROUPS: UNCINECTOMY AND BALLOON SINUPLASTY. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: THE VARIABLES IN OUR STUDY ARE THE SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT 22), ACOUSTIC RHINOMETRY AND RHINOMANOMETRY. THESE PARAMETERS WERE ANALYSED PREOPERATIVELY AND POSTOPERATIVELY (AFTER 3 AND 6 MONTHS). RESULTS: THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF OUR STUDY HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED. BOTH BALLOON SINUPLASTY AND UNCINECTOMY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED ALMOST ALL THE PARAMETERS OF SNOT22 (P < 0.05), WITH NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BEING FOUND BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUPS (P > 0.05).

CORTICOSTEROID THERAPY HAS BEEN WIDELY USED IN CRS. EFFECTIVE TOPICAL DELIVERY HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY PROBLEMATIC. THE POST-ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS) CORRIDOR IS ESSENTIAL FOR ADEQUATE TOPICAL DRUG ACCESS. DEVICES DELIVERING LARGE VOLUME WITH POSITIVE PRESSURE ALLOW BETTER DISTRIBUTION TO SINUS MUCOSA. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF POSTOPERATIVE TOPICAL SINONASAL STEROID IRRIGATIONS FOR CRS. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH CRS UNDERGOING ESS AFTER FAILING PREVIOUS MEDICAL THERAPY WERE RECRUITED. STRUCTURED HISTOPATHOLOGY INCLUDING MARKERS OF EOSINOPHILIA WAS PERFORMED. AFTER SURGERY, PATIENTS RECEIVED EITHER BUDESONIDE 1 MG OR BETAMETHASONE 1 MG DELIVERED IN A 240-ML SQUEEZE BOTTLE DAILY. OUTCOMES OF THE SYMPTOM SCORE, SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST 22 (SNOT-22) SCORE, AND ENDOSCOPY SCORE WERE RECORDED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 111 PATIENTS (MEAN 50.1 ± 13.5 STANDARD DEVIATION [SD] YEARS, 40.5% FEMALE) WERE INCLUDED. MEAN FOLLOW-UP WAS 55.5 ± 33.9 WEEKS. BASELINE AND POSTTREATMENT SYMPTOM SCORES (2.6 ± 1.1 VS 1.2 ± 1.0), SNOT-22 SCORES (2.2 ± 1.1 VS 1.0 ± 0.8), AND ENDOSCOPY SCORES (6.7 ± 3.0 VS 2.5 ± 2.0) REVEALED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT (ALL, P < 0.001). CONTRARY TO PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS, PATIENTS WITH HIGH TISSUE EOSINOPHILIA (>10/HIGH POWER FIELD [HPF]) HAD SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPROVEMENT ON SYMPTOM SCORE (1.9 ± 1.4 VS 1.1 ± 1.0, P = 0.04), SNOT-22 SCORE (1.6 ± 1.3 VS 1.0 ± 0.8, P = 0.03), AND ENDOSCOPY SCORE (5.12 ± 3.4 VS 3.06 ± 3.0, P = 0.01) THAN THOSE WITHOUT. CONCLUSION: THE PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACH TO ESS IN CRS IS EVOLVING. TOPICAL THERAPIES, WHEN USED APPROPRIATELY, ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE FOR THE MOST CHALLENGING EOSINOPHILIC PATIENTS.

TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF OMALIZUMAB THERAPY IN IMPROVING SINONASAL OUTCOMES IN REFRACTORY ALLERGIC FUNGAL RHINOSINUSITIS (AFRS) PATIENTS WITH MODERATE OR SEVERE ASTHMA. 2. TO DETERMINE IF OMALIZUMAB THERAPY REDUCES THE USAGE OF CORTICOSTEROIDS OR ANTIFUNGAL THERAPY IN AFRS PATIENTS DESIGN: THE CLINICAL CHARTS OF PATIENTS WITH AFRS WITH MODERATE OR SEVERE ASTHMA WHO RECEIVED AT LEAST THREE SUBCUTANEOUS INJECTIONS OF OMALIZUMAB THERAPY BETWEEN 1ST JANUARY 2012 AND 1ST MAY 2014 WERE RETROSPECTIVELY REVIEWED. THESE PATIENTS HAD UNDERGONE BILATERAL FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (FESS) AND FAILED ADJUNCT MEDICAL TREATMENTS (ORAL OR TOPICAL CORTICOSTEROIDS AND/OR ANTIFUNGAL THERAPY) PRIOR TO OMALIZUMAB THERAPY. RESULTS: SEVEN PATIENTS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA AND WERE INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY. THE MEAN AGE OF THE PATIENTS WAS 48.14. THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF SUBCUTANEOUS OMALIZUMAB INJECTIONS WAS 7.57 (RANGE 6-11) WITH A MEAN DOSAGE OF 287MG (RANGE 225-375MG). THE MEAN PRE-OMALIZUMAB TREATMENT SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22) SCORE WAS 52.14 WHILE THE MEAN POST-OMALIZUMAB TREATMENT SNOT-22 SCORE WAS 35.86 (31% IMPROVEMENT). THE MEAN PRE-OMALIZUMAB THERAPY PHILLPOTT-JAVER ENDOSCOPIC SCORE (OVER THE LAST ONE YEAR BEFORE OMALIZUMAB THERAPY) WAS 36 WHILE THE MEAN POST-OMALIZUMAB THERAPY ENDOSCOPIC SCORE (FROM THE LAST CLINIC VISIT) WAS 14 (61% IMPROVEMENT). OMALIZUMAB THERAPY REDUCED THE DEPENDENCE OF AFRS PATIENTS ON CORTICOSTEROID AND ANTIFUNGAL TREATMENTS. CONCLUSION: OMALIZUMAB THERAPY CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A POTENTIAL ADJUNCT FOR THE TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY AFRS WITH MODERATE OR SEVERE ASTHMA. HOWEVER, LARGER PROSPECTIVE STUDIES TO CONFIRM THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY WILL BE REQUIRED.","DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, ST.; PAUL'S SINUS CENTRE, 1081 BURRARD ST.;, VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD & NECK SURGERY, CHANGI GENERAL HOSPITAL, 2 SIMEI STREET 3, SINGAPORE.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: ENGCERN@GMAIL.;COM.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, ST.; PAUL'S SINUS CENTRE, 1081 BURRARD ST.;, VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, ST.; PAUL'S SINUS CENTRE, 1081 BURRARD ST.;, VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, ST.; PAUL'S SINUS CENTRE, 1081 BURRARD ST.;, VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA.;",NA,"CROWN COPYRIGHT © 2015.

METHOD: A COHORT OF 40 PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC FRONTAL RHINOSINUSITIS WAS PROSPECTIVELY EVALUATED USING THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) IMAGING, AND ENDOSCOPIC EXAMINATION. ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS) WAS PERFORMED IN THE USUAL FASHION, HOWEVER, WHEN APPROACHING THE FRONTAL SINUS, A 10F FOLEY CATHETER WAS INSERTED AND THE BALLOON INFLATED IN THE FRONTAL OUTFLOW. PATIENTS WERE ASSESSED POSTOPERATIVELY WITH SNOT-22, CT IMAGING, AND ENDOSCOPIC ASSESSMENT AT 6 MONTHS. RESULTS: SUCCESSFUL INTRAOPERATIVE DILATION OF THE FRONTAL RECESS WAS ACHIEVED IN 62 OF 69 FRONTAL SINUSES (90%). NO CEREBROSPINAL FLUID LEAK OR ORBITAL ENTRY OCCURRED. SIX MONTHS POSTOPERATIVE, SNOT-22 SCORES SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT, WHEREAS ENDOSCOPIC ASSESSMENT REVEALED PATENT FRONTAL RECESS IN 55 OF 62 (89%) FRONTAL SINUSES. COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY IMAGING WAS COMPLETED IN 25 PATIENTS COMPRISING 41 OPERATED FRONTAL SINUSES WITH NO MUCOSAL THICKENING SEEN IN 37 OF 41 (90%). CONCLUSION: THE 10F FOLEY CATHETER IS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO DILATE THE FRONTAL RECESS BY COMPRESSION OF EDEMA DURING ESS. IT MAY BE A SAFE AND COST-EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO HIGH-COST COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE SINUS BALLOONS, ESPECIALLY IN RESOURCE-POOR ENVIRONMENTS.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, TANTA UNIVERSITY, TANTA, EGYPT.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, TANTA UNIVERSITY, TANTA, EGYPT.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, TANTA UNIVERSITY, TANTA, EGYPT DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL, CHAPEL HILL, NORTH CAROLINA, USA MOHAMEDTOMOUM@YAHOO.;COM.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL, CHAPEL HILL, NORTH CAROLINA, USA.;",NA,"© THE AUTHOR(S) 2014.",NA,NA,NA,"2014/09/11 06:00","20150908","20140909",2015,"2014/09/11 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,"0003-4894 (PRINT) 0003-4894 (LINKING)","0407300","THE ANNALS OF OTOLOGY, RHINOLOGY, AND LARYNGOLOGY","ENG","10.1177/0003489414550242 [DOI]","20181202","2015/09/09 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","194-7","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"25204713","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"ANN OTOL RHINOL LARYNGOL. 2015 MAR;124(3):194-7.

PARTICIPANTS: CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS UNDERGOING SURGERY FOR NASAL POLYPOSIS AND/OR CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: THE TOTAL SCORE DERIVED FROM A 22-ITEM VERSION OF THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). LOWER SCORES REPRESENT BETTER HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 3128 CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS AT 87 NHS HOSPITALS WERE ENROLLED. THERE IS A LARGE IMPROVEMENT IN SNOT-22 SCORES FROM THE PRE-OPERATIVE PERIOD (MEAN = 42.0) TO 3 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY (MEAN = 25.5). THE SCORES FOR PATIENTS UNDERGOING NASAL POLYPECTOMY IMPROVED FROM 41.0 BEFORE SURGERY TO 23.1 AT 3 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY, WHILE THE SCORES FOR PATIENTS UNDERGOING SURGERY FOR CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS ALONE IMPROVED FROM 44.2 TO 31.2. THE SNOT-22 SCORES REPORTED AT 12 AND 36 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE REPORTED AT 3 MONTHS. EXCESSIVE BLEEDING OCCURRED IN 5% OF PATIENTS DURING THE OPERATION AND IN 1% OF PATIENTS AFTER THE OPERATION. INTRA-ORBITAL COMPLICATIONS WERE REPORTED IN 0.2%. OF THOSE PATIENTS UNDERGOING PRIMARY SURGERY FOR BILATERAL GRADE I OR II POLYPOSIS, 18% HAD NOT RECEIVED A PRE-OPERATIVE COURSE OF STEROID TREATMENT. AT THE 36-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, 11.4% OF PATIENTS HAD UNDERGONE REVISION SURGERY. CONCLUSIONS: THE AUDIT CONFIRMS THAT SINO-NASAL SURGERY IS GENERALLY SAFE AND EFFECTIVE.

FOR CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITH NASAL POLYPOSIS, THE NEED FOR SYSTEMIC CORTICOSTEROIDS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY WHEN USING A STEROID-ELUTING SPACER HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED. STUDY DESIGN: A RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: ACADEMIC RHINOLOGY PRACTICE. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS PATIENTS WITH NASAL POLYPOSIS WHO FAILED MEDICAL THERAPY AND ELECTED ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY WERE ENROLLED. PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO EITHER THE TREATMENT ARM (POSTOPERATIVE PREDNISONE 30 MG DAILY × 7 DAYS; N = 18) OR PLACEBO ARM (POSTOPERATIVE PLACEBO PILL DAILY × 7 DAYS; N = 18). OUTCOMES WERE EVALUATED AT 1 WEEK, 3 WEEKS, AND 2 MONTHS POSTOPERATIVELY. PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS ENDOSCOPIC GRADING AT POSTOPERATIVE MONTH 2 USING THE LUND-KENNEDY SYSTEM. SECONDARY OUTCOME INCLUDED DISEASE-SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE USING THE SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SURVEY. PATIENT ENROLLMENT OCCURRED FROM JANUARY 2012 THROUGH FEBRUARY 2013 (NCT01564355). RESULTS: BOTH ARMS RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ENDOSCOPIC GRADING AND DISEASE-SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE FROM BASELINE COMPARED TO 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (P < .001). THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN MEAN ENDOSCOPIC SCORES BETWEEN THE POSTOPERATIVE PREDNISONE AND CONTROL GROUPS AT 1 WEEK (P = .715), 3 WEEKS (P = .883), OR 2 MONTHS (P = .343). THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN SNOT-22 SCORES BETWEEN GROUPS AT ALL FOLLOW-UP POINTS (ALL P > .119). CONCLUSION: MINIMIZING SYSTEMIC CORTICOSTEROID USE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITH NASAL POLYPOSIS MAY AVOID ADVERSE EVENTS.

DESIGN: PROSPECTIVE LONGITUDINAL STUDY. SETTING: DISTRICT GENERAL HOSPITAL. PARTICIPANTS: A POPULATION OF 71 PATIENTS WITH A MEAN AGE OF 33 YEARS, CONTAINING 36 MALES, PRESENTED WITH NASAL OBSTRUCTION FOR CONSIDERATION OF NASAL SURGERY. ALL PATIENTS UNDERWENT A STRUCTURED CLINICAL ASSESSMENT, SKIN PRICK ALLERGY TESTING AND ORAL-NASAL FLOW-VOLUME LOOP EXAMINATION. FIFTY-ONE PATIENTS COMPLETED THE FOLLOW-UP, AND MEAN FOLLOW-UP WAS 11 MONTHS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: NOSE, SNOT-22 AND NASION SCALES. RESULTS: OF THE 51 PATIENTS WHO COMPLETED FOLLOW-UP, SIX HAD CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT, 28 HAD SEPTAL/TURBINATE SURGERY, AND 17 UNDERWENT NASAL VALVE SURGERY. MEAN NOSE SCORE FELL FROM 68 ± 18 TO 39 ± 31 FOLLOWING THE TREATMENT. MEAN SNOT-22 SCORE FELL FROM 47 ± 20 TO 29 ± 26 FOLLOWING THE TREATMENT. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRE-TREATMENT AND POST-TREATMENT NOSE AND SNOT-22 SCORES WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. SUCCESS RATE OF SEPTAL/TURBINATE SURGERY IN PATIENTS WITHOUT NASAL ALLERGY WAS 88%, AND THIS FELL TO 42% IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING SEPTAL/TURBINATE SURGERY WHO ALSO HAD NASAL ALLERGY. PRESENCE OF NASAL ALLERGY WAS THE ONLY INDEPENDENT PREDICTOR OF TREATMENT FAILURE. PATIENTS WITH NASAL VALVE SURGERY REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER SYMPTOMATIC IMPROVEMENT FOLLOWING SURGERY.

INCREASINGLY, PRACTITIONERS ARE USING BUDESONIDE RESPULES DELIVERED TO THE SINONASAL CAVITIES, WHICH IS AN OFF-LABEL USE, IN LIEU OF TRADITIONAL NASAL STEROIDS. THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE RESEARCH COMPARING BUDESONIDE WITH TRADITIONAL NASAL STEROIDS AND THE MOST EFFECTIVE DELIVERY METHOD OF BUDESONIDE. METHODS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS PERFORMED ON PATIENTS AFTER ESS FOR CRSWNP IN A TERTIARY CARE CENTER. PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO 1 OF 3 GROUPS: GROUP A RECEIVED FLUTICASONE NASAL SPRAY TWICE DAILY; GROUP B RECEIVED BUDESONIDE RESPULES VIA A MUCOSAL ATOMIZATION DEVICE (MAD) TWICE DAILY; AND GROUP C RECEIVED BUDESONIDE RESPULES INSTILLED VIA THE VERTEX-TO-FLOOR (VF) POSITION TWICE DAILY. PRIMARY ENDPOINTS WERE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AND LUND-KENNEDY SCORES AT 6 MONTHS. RESULTS: THIRTY-TWO PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED IN THE STUDY, 23 OF WHOM COMPLETED THE 6-MONTH TRIAL. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AMONG GROUPS A, B, AND C WITH RESPECT TO AGE, GENDER, ASTHMA, ASPIRIN SENSITIVITY, OR PREVIOUS ESS. GROUP B HAD A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT GREATER REDUCTION IN SNOT-22 AND LUND-KENNEDY SCORES AT THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT OF 6 MONTHS COMPARED TO GROUPS A AND C. GROUP C HAD THE NEXT GREATEST REDUCTION, WHICH WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, FOLLOWED BY GROUP A. CONCLUSION: PATIENTS TREATED WITH BUDESONIDE AFTER ESS FOR CRSWNP HAD GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN SNOT-22 AND LUND-KENNEDY SCORES COMPARED TO FLUTICASONE AT 6 MONTHS. THE DATA SUPPORTS THE USE OF BUDESONIDE RESPULES, PARTICULARLY WITH A MAD, OVER FLUTICASONE FOR CRSWNP PATIENTS AFTER ESS.","SECTION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, YALE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, NEW HAVEN, CT.; YALE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, NEW HAVEN, CT.; SECTION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, YALE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, NEW HAVEN, CT.;",NA,"© 2015 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2015/12/19 06:00","20161223","20151217",2016,"2015/12/19 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.21688 [DOI]","20161230","2016/12/24 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","233-7","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"26679480","PPUBLISH","0 (NASAL SPRAYS) 51333-22-3 (BUDESONIDE) CUT2W21N7U (FLUTICASONE)","IM","CLINICALTRIALS.GOV/NCT02194062","INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2016 MAR;6(3):233-7.

DESIGN: PROSPECTIVE RANDOMISED SINGLE-BLINDED STUDY. SETTING: TERTIARY REFERRAL CENTRE. PARTICIPANTS: THIRTY-ONE PATIENTS, UNDERGOING FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY FOR CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITH AND WITHOUT POLYPS, WERE RECRUITED FOR THE STUDY. THE PATIENTS ACTED AS THEIR OWN COMPARATORS SELF-ADMINISTERING EACH DOUCHE THREE TIMES DAILY INTO ONE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED NOSTRIL FOR A PERIOD OF 12 WEEKS FOLLOWING THE SURGERY. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS A BLINDED OBJECTIVE ENDOSCOPIC ASSESSMENT OF EACH OPERATED SIDE USING A MODIFIED LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPIC ASSESSMENT TOOL UNDERTAKEN AT 2, 4 AND 12 WEEKS POSTOPERATIVELY. AS SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES, THE PATIENTS WERE ASKED TO EXPRESS A PREFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO PRODUCTS BASED ON PERCEIVED EFFECTIVENESS AND EASE OF USE. RESULTS: COMPARED WITH THE PREOPERATIVE SCORES, THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE SNOT-22 SCORE AT ALL THREE POSTOPERATIVE TIME POINTS (P < 0.001). COMPARED WITH WEEK 2, THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE MODIFIED LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPIC SCORES (P < 0.05) FOR BOTH STERIMAR™ AND SINUS RINSE™ AT WEEKS 4 AND 12. WHEN COMPARING STERIMAR™ WITH SINURINSE™, THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT LOWER MODIFIED LUND-KENNEDY SCORE AT 2 AND 4 WEEKS POSTOPERATIVELY FOR THE SIDE TREATED WITH SINUS RINSE™ (P = 0.05), INDICATING A MORE FAVOURABLE OUTCOME. HOWEVER, THIS DIFFERENCE WAS NOT APPARENT AT 12 WEEKS POSTOPERATIVELY (P = 0.66). AT ALL TIME POINTS, PATIENTS PERCEIVED SINUS RINSE™ TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN STERIMAR™ (P < 0.0001), BUT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE PATIENTS' PREFERENCE FOR EITHER PRODUCT (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: HIGH-VOLUME LOW-PRESSURE SALINE IRRIGATION IS RECOMMENDED AS AN EFFICACIOUS, EASY TO USE AND WELL-TOLERATED ADJUNCT TO ENDOSCOPIC SINONASAL TOILET IN THE EARLY POSTOPERATIVE PERIOD FOLLOWING FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY.","ACADEMIC UNIT OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCES, DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL SOUTHAMPTON NHS FOUNDATION TRUST, SOUTHAMPTON, UK.; R.;J.;SALIB@SOUTHAMPTON.;AC.;UK",NA,"© 2013 JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD.",NA,NA,NA,"2013/05/30 06:00","20140326",NA,2013,"2013/05/30 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"4",NA,"1749-4486 (ELECTRONIC) 1749-4478 (LINKING)","101247023","CLINICAL OTOLARYNGOLOGY : OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF ENT-UK ; OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF NETHERLANDS SOCIETY FOR OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY & CERVICO-FACIAL SURGERY","ENG","10.1111/COA.12132 [DOI]","20151119","2014/03/29 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","297-305","ENGLAND",NA,NA,"23714166","PPUBLISH","0 (ISOTONIC SOLUTIONS) 451W47IQ8X (SODIUM CHLORIDE)","IM",NA,"CLIN OTOLARYNGOL. 2013 AUG;38(4):297-305.

ENDOSCOPIC NASAL SURGERY HAS BEEN INDICATED FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS, RESULTING IN IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE, BUT IT IS STILL UNKNOWN IF THERE IS A SIMILAR IMPROVEMENT IN SLEEP QUALITY AFTER THE SURGICAL PROCEDURE. OBJECTIVE: TO ESTIMATE THE SLEEP QUALITY OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS AFTER UNDERGOING ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY. METHODS: THE LITERATURE SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED IN THE INDEXED DATABASES PUBMED, EMBASE, LILACS, SCIELO, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, WEB OF SCIENCE, SCOPUS, DATABASE OF THESIS AND DISSERTATIONS OF CAPES, COCHRANE LIBRARY, CLINICAL TRIALS AND IN THE GREY LITERATURE. IT INCLUDED STUDIES THAT REPORTED THE SLEEP QUALITY OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS AFTER UNDERGOING ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY BASED ON QUESTIONNAIRES ASSESSING QUALITY OF LIFE. TWO RESEARCHERS INDEPENDENTLY CONDUCTED THE STUDY SELECTION AND EXTRACTION. THE RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL WAS CHOSEN TO CONDUCT THE META-ANALYSIS THAT WAS PERFORMED USING THE STATISTICAL PACKAGE STATA, VERSION 11. RESULTS: OVERALL, 4 STUDIES AND 509 SUBJECTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. IMPROVED SLEEP QUALITY WAS OBSERVED IN 90% OF THE PATIENTS. THERE WAS AN IMPROVEMENT (ON AVERAGE, FROM 57% TO 67%) IN EACH OF THE FIVE SYMPTOMS RELATED TO SLEEP QUALITY. THE RESULTS OF THE META-ANALYSIS REVEALED HIGH HETEROGENEITY. CONCLUSIONS: THIS REVIEW SHOWS THAT A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS REPORT IMPROVED SLEEP QUALITY AFTER ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY.","UNIVERSIDADE DE BRASÍLIA (UNB), FACULDADE DE MEDICINA, BRASÍLIA, DF, BRAZIL; HOSPITAL UNIVERSITÁRIO DE BRASÍLIA, DIVISÃO DE CIRURGIA, DEPARTAMENTO DE OTORRINOLARINGOLOGIA - CIRURGIA DE CABEÇA E PESCOÇO, BRASÍLIA, DF, BRAZIL.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: MANUDOWSLEY@YAHOO.;COM.;BR.; UNIVERSIDADE DE BRASÍLIA (UNB), FACULDADE DE MEDICINA, BRASÍLIA, DF, BRAZIL.; HOSPITAL UNIVERSITÁRIO DE BRASÍLIA, DIVISÃO DE CIRURGIA, DEPARTAMENTO DE OTORRINOLARINGOLOGIA - CIRURGIA DE CABEÇA E PESCOÇO, BRASÍLIA, DF, BRAZIL.; UNIVERSIDADE DE BRASÍLIA (UNB), FACULDADE DE MEDICINA, BRASÍLIA, DF, BRAZIL.; UNIVERSIDADE DE BRASÍLIA (UNB), FACULDADE DE MEDICINA, BRASÍLIA, DF, BRAZIL.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT © 2019 ASSOCIAÇÃO BRASILEIRA DE OTORRINOLARINGOLOGIA E CIRURGIA CÉRVICO-FACIAL.

IT IS HYPOTHESISED THAT THE PERFORMANCE OF AN EXTENSIVE ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (EESS), INVOLVING COMPLETE REMOVAL OF NASAL POLYPS ALONG WITH FULL ETHMOID CLEARANCE, WILL DECREASE THE RECURRENCE RATE AND THEREFORE BE AN ADVANTAGE TO THE PATIENT. THIS STUDY IS A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF 149 PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT EESS IN A DISTRICT GENERAL HOSPITAL. SURGICAL REVISION RATES AND PERIOPERATIVE COMPLICATION DATA WERE RECORDED. A COMPARISON WAS MADE WITH PATIENTS ENLISTED WITH THE UK NATIONAL COMPARATIVE AUDIT WHO UNDERWENT POLYP DISEASE REMOVAL LIMITED TO THE ANTERIOR ETHMOID CAVITY. A FURTHER MEASURE REGARDING QUALITY OF LIFE WAS DERIVED FROM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST 22 (SNOT-22). AT 36 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY, FIVE PATIENTS FROM THE EXTENSIVE SURGERY GROUP HAD UNDERGONE A REVISION PROCEDURE, WHICH WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THE NATIONAL AUDIT FIGURE (4.0 VS. 12.3% P = <0.006). THE PERIOPERATIVE ADVERSE COMPLICATION RATE WAS SIMILAR (7.4 VS. 6.6% P = <0.774). THERE IS A LARGE IMPROVEMENT IN SNOT-22 SCORES FROM THE PRE-OPERATIVE PERIOD (MEAN 39) TO THE POST-OPERATIVE PERIOD (MEAN 8). THIS STUDY PROVIDES SOME EVIDENCE THAT EXTENSIVE SINUS SURGERY PERFORMED BY AN EXPERIENCED RHINOLOGIST CAN LEAD TO A LOWER REVISION RATE WITHOUT COMPROMISING PATIENT SAFETY.

THIS SYMPTOM, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN INSUFFICIENTLY STUDIED IN THE GROUP OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITH NASAL POLYPS (CRSWNP). THE AIM OF THIS WORK IS TO STUDY THE SYMPTOM OF FACIAL PAIN IN PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH CRSWNP WERE PROSPECTIVELY ASKED TO SCORE THEIR FACIAL PAIN ACCORDING TO THE SCORING SYSTEM USED IN THE SINO NASAL OUTCOME TEST 22 (SNOT 22). RESULTS: FIFTY PATIENTS FULFILLED THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THIRTY-ONE PATIENTS HAD GRADE II POLYPS AND 19 PATIENTS HAD GRADE III POLYPS. OF THESE PATIENTS, 76% HAD ABSENT OR VERY MILD FACIAL PAIN. ONLY 16% OF PATIENTS HAD MODERATE OR SEVERE FACIAL PAIN. ALL PATIENTS WITH SEVERE FACIAL PAIN HAD VISCID SECRETIONS WITHIN THEIR SINUSES.

METHOD: THIS IS A PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL STUDY IN A TERTIARY REFERRAL CENTER INVOLVING ADULT PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH NSP. THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22) AND ITS CLINICO-PSYCHOMETRIC DOMAINS WERE ANALYZED, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL NSP-SPECIFIC SYMPTOMS (NASAL CRUSTING, EPISTAXIS, AND WHISTLING NOISE DURING NASAL BREATHING). THE SIZE OF NSP WAS MEASURED RADIOLOGICALLY BY CALCULATING THE AREA IN CM(2) AND ANTEROPOSTERIOR (AP) DIAMETER. POSITION OF PERFORATION WAS DETERMINED CLINICALLY BY DISTANCE FROM COLUMELLA TO THE ANTERIOR EDGE OF THE PERFORATION. RESULTS: FORTY PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY (22 MALES). THE MOST COMMON ETIOLOGY OF NSP WAS IATROGENIC. THE MEAN SNOT-22 SCORE WAS 50.8 (STANDARD DEVIATION 23.8), AND MEAN NSP SIZE WAS 3.0 CM(2) . NO STATISTICAL CORRELATION WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN THE TOTAL SNOT-22 SCORE WITH EITHER POSITION OR SIZE OF NSP. AS FOR NSP-SPECIFIC SYMPTOMS, THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CORRELATION WITH THE SIZE OF PERFORATION (A-P DIAMETER) (R = -0.34, P = 0.03) AND POSITION OF THE PERFORATION (R = -0.49, P = 0.0016), SUGGESTING THAT THESE SYMPTOMS IMPROVED WITH POSTERIOR AND LARGER PERFORATIONS. CONCLUSION: REPORTED SNOT-22 SCORES WERE COMPARABLE TO PATIENTS WITH RECALCITRANT CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS, ALTHOUGH THE SCORES DID NOT CORRELATE WITH SIZE AND POSITION OF NSP. SINONASAL SYMPTOMS TYPICALLY OBSERVED IN NSP IMPROVED WITH MORE POSTERIORLY PLACED AND LARGER SIZED PERFORATIONS. THIS STUDY PROVIDES AN INSIGHT INTO THE QUALITY-OF-LIFE IMPACT OF NSP AND AFFIRMS THE CLINICAL OBSERVATION THAT ANTERIOR NSP ARE MORE SYMPTOMATIC.

STANDARDIZED QUESTIONNAIRES TO ASSESS THE POSTOPERATIVE SEQUELAE ARE MISSING. THE AUTHORS PRESENT A CUSTOM-MADE QUESTIONNAIRE FOR THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST FOR NEUROSURGERY (SNOT-NC) IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SNOT-22. METHODS: THE SNOT-NC WAS DEVELOPED WITH RESPECT TO THE GERMAN VERSION OF THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) WHICH IS USED FOR PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM RHINOSINUSITIS. IT CONSISTS OF 23 ITEMS COVERING \"NASAL DISCOMFORT\", SLEEP PROBLEMS/REDUCED PRODUCTIVITY\", \"EAR AND HEAD DISCOMFORT\", \"VISUAL IMPAIRMENT\" AND \"OLFACTORY IMPAIRMENT\". THE SNOT-NC WAS SPECIFICALLY ADAPTED TO PATIENTS UNDERGOING TRANSNASAL OPERATIONS OF SKULL BASE LESIONS. THE SHORT FORM 36 HEALTH SURVEY (SF-36), A NASAL AD HOC QUESTIONNAIRE AND THE \"SNIFFIN' STICKS\" TEST WERE USED FOR ANALYZING CONVERGENT AND DIVERGENT VALIDITY. THE PSYCHOMETRIC AND CLINIMETRIC ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED USING THE DATA OF 102 CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS TREATED BY TRANSNASAL OPERATIONS FOR SKULL BASE LESIONS. RESULTS: FACTORIAL VALIDITY WAS SECURED BY A CONFIRMATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS. THE INTERNAL CONSISTENCY (CRONBACH'S ALPHA) FOR THE SUBSCALES RANGED FROM .62 TO .85, WHILE IT WAS .84 FOR THE WHOLE INSTRUMENT. THE GUTTMAN'S LOWER RELIABILITY LIMITS RANGE ESTIMATES CORRESPONDED CLOSELY TO THE CRONBACH'S ALPHA COEFFICIENTS OBTAINED. EXAMINATION OF CONVERGENT AND DIVERGENT VALIDITY REVEALED SUBSTANTIAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN THE SNOT-NC AND A WIDE RANGE OF RELATED NASAL SYMPTOMS (P < .05). DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF SENSITIVITY WERE ANALYZED STATISTICALLY WITH COHEN'S T STATISTIC FOR CHANGE (PAIRWISE T TESTS) EXHIBITING AT LEAST P < .05) UNDERLINING THE SENSITIVITY OF THE SNOT-NC.

A SNOT-22 SCORE OF =25 POINTS OR LOWER, OR AN EQ-5D VAS SCORE OF =77 WAS PREDICTIVE OF HAVING WELL - (I.E. 'VERY' OR 'COMPLETELY') CONTROLLED CRS. CONCLUSIONS: PATIENT-REPORTED CRS DISEASE CONTROL IS A VALID MEASURE OF CRS DISEASE BURDEN AND GENERAL QOL. A PATIENT-REPORTED ASSESSMENT OF CRS DISEASE CONTROL COULD BE CONSIDERED AS A COMPONENT OF A MORE COMPREHENSIVE MEASURE OF CRS DISEASE CONTROL.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, CINCINNATI, OH, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, CINCINNATI, OH, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, CINCINNATI, OH, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, CINCINNATI, OH, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, CINCINNATI, OH, USA.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021/11/11 12:20","20211207",NA,2021,"2021/11/12 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"6",NA,"0300-0729 (PRINT) 0300-0729 (LINKING)","0347242","RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.4193/RHIN21.282 [DOI]","20211214","2021/12/15 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","545-551","NETHERLANDS",NA,NA,"34762075","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"RHINOLOGY. 2021 DEC 1;59(6):545-551.

IN ADDITION TO THE THERAPEUTIC ROUTINES AND SURGICAL OPTIONS AVAILABLE, A LOW DIETARY INTAKE OF FOOD SALICYLATE HAS BEEN SUGGESTED AS ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY FOR THIS CONDITION. THIS STUDY AIMED TO ASSESS THE INFLUENCE OF A SHORT-TERM LOW SALICYLATE DIET ON INFLAMMATORY MARKERS IN PATIENTS WITH AERD AND WHETHER THAT WOULD RESULT IN SYMPTOMATIC IMPROVEMENT. METHODS: PROSPECTIVE STUDY WITH RANDOMIZATION TO EITHER A HIGH OR LOW SALICYLATE DIET FOR 1 WEEK, FOLLOWED BY CROSS-OVER TO THE OTHER STUDY ARM. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO RECORD THEIR DIETARY SALICYLATE FOR EACH WEEK OF THE STUDY. URINARY CREATININE, SALICYLATE AND LEUKOTRIENE LEVELS WERE MEASURED AT THE TIME OF RECRUITMENT, END OF WEEK ONE AND END OF WEEK TWO AND THE SNOT-22 QUESTIONNAIRE WAS FILLED OUT AT THE SAME TIME POINTS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF SEVEN PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. THERE WAS NO STATISTICAL DIFFERENCE IN THE URINARY SALICYLATE AND LEUKOTRIENE LEVELS BETWEEN THE TWO DIETS; NEVERTHELESS, PARTICIPANTS ON LOW SALICYLATE DIET REPORTED IMPROVED SNOT-22 SYMPTOMS SCORES (P = 0.04), MAINLY IN THE RHINOLOGIC, EAR/FACIAL, AND SLEEP DYSFUNCTION SYMPTOM DOMAINS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: TELEHEALTH CONSULTATIONS WERE PERFORMED BY THE DEPARTMENTS OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY OF FOGGIA AND BARI UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS. PARTICIPANTS TOOK PART IN A PHONE INTERVIEW AND WERE ASKED ABOUT THEIR SINONASAL SYMPTOMS DURING THE COVID-19 LOCKDOWN, BY ANSWERING THE SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (I-SNOT-22) QUESTIONNAIRE. FURTHER DATA CONCERNING THE MEDICATIONS USED TO TREAT ALLERGY AND THE NUMBER OF DAYS PER MONTH IN WHICH THEY WERE USED WERE COLLECTED. THE RESPONSES ABOUT THE COVID-19 LOCKDOWN WERE COMPARED TO THOSE OBTAINED BY THE SAME PATIENTS IN OUR CLINICS THE PREVIOUS YEAR. THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS EXECUTED BY USING THE PAIRED SAMPLE T-TEST AND THE BARTLETT TEST CONSIDERING AS SIGNIFICANT VALUES WITH P VALUES <0.05. RESULTS: FORTY PATIENTS AFFECTED BY CYPRESS POLLEN ALLERGY VISITED AT FOGGIA AND BARI UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS WERE ENROLLED IN THIS STUDY. ALL I-SNOT-22 SCORES CONCERNING THE COVID-19 LOCKDOWN WERE LOWER THAN THOSE OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR; MOREOVER, 18 (81.8%) CLINICAL PARAMETERS WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05). ALSO, IN REGARD TO THE TREATMENT, RESULTS ABOUT COVID-19 LOCKDOWN WERE OVERALL BETTER THAN THOSE OF 2019, WITH 50% (N=3) OF THE INVESTIGATED DRUGS, REPORTING STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: THE PRESENT STUDY WAS ABLE TO EVIDENCE THE FUNDAMENTAL ROLE OF PRIMARY PREVENTION IN ALLERGOLOGY.

STUDY DESIGN: THIS WAS A PROSPECTIVE, MULTICENTER COHORT STUDY OF ADULTS UNDERGOING SINONASAL SURGERY. METHODS: EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY-FOUR PATIENTS RECEIVED SIMPLE POLYPECTOMY AND 1,004 PATIENTS RECEIVED POLYPECTOMY WITH ADDITIONAL SURGERY. HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE WAS COMPARED AT 12 AND 36 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY USING THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). TOTAL SNOT-22 SCORES MAY RANGE FROM ZERO TO 110 WITH LOWER SCORES REPRESENTING BETTER OUTCOMES. WE USED LINEAR REGRESSION TO ADJUST POSTOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORES FOR BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS. WHEN COMPARING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SURGICAL TECHNIQUES, POSITIVE SNOT-22 SCORES REPRESENT A BETTER OUTCOME FOR THOSE UNDERGOING ADDITIONAL SURGERY. RESULTS: THERE WERE ONLY SMALL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS AT 12 MONTHS (DIFFERENCE IN SNOT-22 -0.5; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI]=-2.3-1.3; P=.58) AND 36 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY (DIFFERENCE -2.1; 95% CI=-4.4-0.2; P=.08). THE ADDITIONAL SURGERY GROUP HAD A SLIGHTLY HIGHER RISK OF EXCESSIVE PERIOPERATIVE BLEEDING (8.6% VS. 6.0%; P=.04) BUT A SLIGHTLY LOWER RISK OF REVISION SURGERY WITHIN 36 MONTHS (10.4% VS. 13.3%; P=.12).

ALTHOUGH EARLIER WORK HAS DEMONSTRATED AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN OLFACTORY LOSS AND MUCUS CYTOKINES, THE IMPACT ON OTHER SYMPTOMS IS UNKNOWN. IN THIS STUDY WE INVESTIGATED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CYTOKINES, INFLAMMATORY CELL COUNTS, AND PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES MEASURES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THE INFLAMMATORY MICROENVIRONMENT CORRELATES WITH CRS SYMPTOMATOLOGY. METHODS: THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AND 8-ITEM SHORT FORM HEALTH SURVEY (SF-8) WERE ADMINISTERED TO 76 PATIENTS UNDERGOING ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY FOR CRS. MUCUS WAS COLLECTED INTRAOPERATIVELY FROM THE MIDDLE MEATUS AND TESTED FOR 17 CYTOKINES USING A MULTIPLEX FLOW CYTOMETRIC BEAD ASSAY. EOSINOPHIL/NEUTROPHIL COUNTS WERE OBTAINED FROM HISTOPATHOLOGIC SLIDE REVIEW. SPEARMAN CORRELATIONS BETWEEN CYTOKINES, CELL COUNTS, AND QUALITY-OF-LIFE SUBDOMAIN SCORES WERE ASSESSED WITHOUT MULTIPLE COMPARISONS CORRECTION DUE TO THE SMALL SAMPLE SIZE. RESULTS: INTERLEUKIN-4 (IL-4) CORRELATED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH THE RHINOLOGIC DOMAIN (R(S) = 0.25, P = 0.03), WHEREAS EOSINOPHIL AND NEUTROPHIL COUNTS WERE INVERSELY CORRELATED WITH THE EXTRANASAL RHINOLOGIC DOMAIN (R(S) = -0.32, P = 0.01; AND R(S) = -0.27, P = 0.03). SUBGROUP ANALYSIS FOR NASAL POLYPOSIS (CRSWNP) SHOWED SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS BETWEEN IL-6 AND TOTAL SF-8 (R(S) = 0.35, P = 0.02), GENERAL HEALTH (R(S) = 0.34, P = 0.03), AND EMOTIONAL (R(S) = 0.47, P = 0.002) SCORES. IN PATIENTS WITHOUT POLYPS (CRSSNP), IL-21 CORRELATED POSITIVELY WITH EXTRANASAL RHINOLOGIC SYMPTOMS DOMAIN (R(S) = 0.41, P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: THIS PILOT STUDY IDENTIFIES POSSIBLE PAIRWISE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN MUCUS CYTOKINE LEVELS AND BASELINE QUALITY-OF-LIFE MEASURES THAT NEED CONFIRMATION IN LARGER, TARGETED STUDIES. DUE TO THE EXPLORATORY METHODOLOGY, POSITIVE RESULTS MAY BE SPURIOUS AND SHOULD ONLY BE USED AS A STARTING POINT FOR FUTURE CONFIRMATORY WORK.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, NASHVILLE, TN.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, NASHVILLE, TN.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, NASHVILLE, TN.; DEPARTMENT OF PATHOLOGY, MICROBIOLOGY, IMMUNOLOGY, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, NASHVILLE, TN.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, NASHVILLE, TN.;",NA,"© 2019 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2019/01/11 06:00","20200303","20190110",2019,"2019/01/11 06:00",NA,NA,"R03 DC014809/NH/NIH HHS/UNITED STATES L30 AI113795/NH/NIH HHS/UNITED STATES CTSA AWARD UL1TR000445/NH/NIH HHS/UNITED STATES","5",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.22287 [DOI]","20200303","2020/03/04 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","538-544","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"30629853","PPUBLISH","0 (CYTOKINES)","IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2019 MAY;9(5):538-544.

LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PAIN AND DEPRESSION IN CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS). OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO INVESTIGATE THIS RELATIONSHIP AND TO ANALYZE THE EFFECT OF PAIN AND DEPRESSION ON QOL IN CRS. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH CRS WERE PROSPECTIVELY RECRUITED AS PART OF AN OBSERVATIONAL COHORT STUDY. A TOTAL OF 70 PARTICIPANTS PROVIDED PAIN SCORES USING BOTH THE BRIEF PAIN INVENTORY SHORT FORM (BPI-SF) AND THE SHORT FORM MCGILL PAIN QUESTIONNAIRE (SF-MPQ). PATIENTS AT RISK FOR DEPRESSION WERE IDENTIFIED USING THE PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE-2 (PHQ-2). CRS-SPECIFIC QOL WAS DETERMINED USING THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATIONS WERE FOUND BETWEEN DEPRESSION SCORES AND ALL PAIN MEASURES (R = 0.475 TO 0.644, P < 0.001). PATIENTS WITH A PHQ-2 SCORE =1 HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SCORES ON ALL REPORTED PAIN MEASURES. SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATIONS WERE FOUND BETWEEN ALL PAIN MEASURES, THE TOTAL SNOT-22 SCORE, AND 3 SNOT-22 SUBDOMAINS (SLEEP, PSYCHOLOGICAL DYSFUNCTION, AND EAR/FACIAL SYMPTOMS; R = 0.323 TO 0.608, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: ADULT PATIENTS WITH CRS AT RISK FOR DEPRESSION EXPERIENCE MORE PAIN AND HAVE OVERALL WORSE DISEASE-SPECIFIC QOL.

TO WHAT EXTENT ELITE SWIMMERS SUFFER FROM UPPER AIRWAY SYMPTOMS AND HOW THESE ASSOCIATE WITH NASAL INFLAMMATION IS LESS CLEAR. WE HERE AIMED TO EVALUATE UPPER AIRWAY SYMPTOMS AND NASAL INFLAMMATION IN ELITE ATHLETES. METHODOLOGY: ELITE SWIMMERS, INDOOR ATHLETES AND AGE-MATCHED CONTROLS WERE RECRUITED. UPPER AIRWAY SYMPTOMS WERE ASSESSED BY SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT)-22 QUESTIONNAIRE. VISUAL ANALOGUE SCORE (VAS) FOR NASAL SYMPTOMS AS WELL AS NEUROGENIC AND INFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS IN NASAL FLUID WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, IMMEDIATELY AND 24-HOURS AFTER SPORT-SPECIFIC TRAINING. THE EFFECT OF HYPOCHLORITE ON NASAL EPITHELIAL CELLS WAS EVALUATED IN VITRO. RESULTS: BASELINE SNOT-22 AND VAS FOR NASAL ITCH AND IMPAIRED SMELL WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN SWIMMERS COMPARED TO CONTROLS.

STUDIES EVALUATING THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACT OF CRS ARE MOSTLY LIMITED TO THE US POPULATION. CURRENTLY THERE IS NO STUDY THAT HAS EVALUATED THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC COSTS OF CRS IN THE UK. METHODS: A CASE-CONTROL STUDY OF PATIENTS WITH CRS AND HEALTHY CONTROLS WAS CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE THE WIDER SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE DISEASE. DATA ON DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS, OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENDITURE (OOPE), HEALTH RESOURCE UTILISATION, PRODUCTIVITY LOSSES AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) VIA THE EQ-5D AND SNOT-22 INSTRUMENTS, WERE COLLECTED FROM QUESTIONNAIRES. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 139 CRS PARTICIPANTS AND 67 CONTROL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE QUESTIONNAIRES. THE AVERAGE TOTAL OOPE PER PATIENT EXTRAPOLATED TO A 12-MONTH PERIOD WAS £304.84. OTHER IMPORTANT FINDINGS INCLUDE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REPORTED PRIMARY CARE INTERACTIONS (4.14 VS. 1.16) AS WELL AS SECONDARY CARE INTERACTIONS (2.61 VS 0.4) IN CRS GROUP AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS OVER THREE-MONTHS. THE AVERAGE TOTAL MISSED WORKDAYS WAS ESTIMATED TO BE 18.7 PER PATIENT PER YEAR. THE ESTIMATED INCREMENTAL HEALTHCARE COST OF CRS PER YEAR IS £16.8 BILLION OR £2.8 BILLION PER MILLION INHABITANTS. FACTORS PREDICTIVE OF A HIGHER OOPE INCLUDE HIGHER HOUSEHOLD OCCUPANCY AND INCOME AND THESE ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY 9.7% OF THE TOTAL VARIANCE IN TOTAL OOPES. OTHER SOCIOECONOMIC, DEMOGRAPHIC AND HRQOL VARIABLES WERE NOT FOUND TO BE PREDICTIVE FACTORS OF OOPE. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT CRS HAS A SIGNIFICANT WIDER ECONOMIC BURDEN BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE DIRECT HEALTHCARE COSTS. CRS PARTICIPANTS HAD A HIGH LEVEL OF HEALTHCARE SERVICE USE, OOPE AND PRODUCTIVITY LOSS. RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY WILL ADD TO THE EXISTING LIMITED DATA BOTH FOR THE UK AND ABROAD AND EMPHASISES THE NEED FOR EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS FOR THESE PATIENTS TO REDUCE THE DISEASE IMPACT.","NORWICH MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA, NORFOLK, UNITED KINGDOM.; NORWICH MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA, NORFOLK, UNITED KINGDOM.; NORWICH MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA, NORFOLK, UNITED KINGDOM.; THE IPSWICH HOSPITAL, IPSWICH, UNITED KINGDOM.; NORWICH MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA, NORFOLK, UNITED KINGDOM.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020/03/16 06:00","20200904",NA,2020,"2020/03/17 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,"0300-0729 (PRINT) 0300-0729 (LINKING)","0347242","RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.4193/RHIN19.424 [DOI]","20200904","2020/09/05 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","112-125","NETHERLANDS",NA,NA,"32172284","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"RHINOLOGY. 2020 APR 1;58(2):112-125.

THE HISTOPATHOLOGIC FEATURES OF RADIATION-INDUCED CRS HAVE YET TO BE DETERMINED AND MAY HAVE MAJOR IMPLICATIONS IN DISEASE MANAGEMENT. METHODS: A STRUCTURED HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT WAS UTILIZED TO ANALYZE SINUS TISSUE REMOVED DURING FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (FESS). HISTOPATHOLOGY VARIABLES, LUND-MACKAY SCORE (LMS), AND 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES WERE COMPARED AMONG PATIENTS WITH RADIATION-INDUCED CRS (CRSR), CRS WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS (CRSSNP), AND CRS WITH NASAL POLYPS (CRSWNP). RESULTS: FIFTEEN CRSR, 43 CRSSNP, AND 56 CRSWNP PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT FESS WERE ANALYZED.

THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO COMPARE PNIF AND UNILATERAL PNIF WITH NASAL RESISTANCES MEASURED BY MEANS OF AAR IN THE EVALUATION OF THE NASAL CYCLE. METHODS: PNIF, UNILATERAL PNIF AND AAR MEASUREMENTS WERE RANDOMLY PERFORMED IN 20 NON-SMOKERS, NON-ASTHMATIC VOLUNTEERS, WITH A SNOT 22 SCORE LOWER THAN 1. NASAL MEASUREMENTS WERE DONE FOUR TIMES IN A SINGLE DAY AT 08.30, 11.00, 13.30 AND 16.00. THE CORRELATION BETWEEN PNIF, UNILATERAL PNIF AND NASAL RESISTANCES WAS STUDIED. THE PATTERN OF NASAL AIRFLOW FOR EACH SUBJECT WAS ALSO ANALYZED. RESULTS: A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN PNIF-LPNIF-RPNIF AND RESPECTIVELY AAR-LAAR-RAAR WAS FOUND. ONLY 1 SUBJECT DID NOT SHOW NASAL CYCLE, WHILE ALL THE REST WERE EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED BETWEEN A RECIPROCAL PATTERN OF THE NASAL CYCLE, OR AN IN-PHASE CHANGES OF THE NASAL CYCLE, BOTH AT PNIF AND AAR. CONCLUSIONS: NASAL CYCLE CAN BE EASILY ASSESSED BY MEANS OF PNIF. IN FACT, AAR AND PNIF SHOWED A REASONABLE CORRELATION IN THE MEASUREMENT OF NASAL CYCLE, ALTHOUGH PNIF OFFERED A LOWER VARIABILITY.

METHODS: THIRTY-FIVE PATIENTS WITH RECALCITRANT NASAL OBSTRUCTION AND NVB PRESENCE WERE RETROSPECTIVELY REVIEWED BETWEEN 2013 AND 2019, INCLUDING 25 PATIENTS (48 SIDES) WHO HAD NVBS REDUCED VIA RADIOFREQUENCY ABLATION (RFA) AND 10 PATIENTS (20 SIDES) WHO HAD UNTREATED NVBS. POSTTREATMENT HEALING AND COMPLICATIONS WERE REVIEWED AT EARLY (<1 MONTH) AND LATE (MEAN, 7.3 MONTHS) TIME-POINTS AFTER RFA OF THE NVB. A SUBSET OF THE NVB-TREATMENT PATIENTS (18 OF 25 PATIENTS) WERE COMPARED WITH 10 NVB-CONTROL PATIENTS FOR PRE-/POSTTREATMENT OUTCOMES USING 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AND SUBDOMAIN SCORING.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER SECRETED P-GP CONCENTRATIONS ARE ELEVATED IN CRS AND CAN BE USED TO PREDICT DISEASE SEVERITY. METHODS: INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD-APPROVED STUDY EXAMINING MUCUS CONCENTRATIONS OF P-GP IN 36 PATIENTS (10 CONTROL, 16 CRS WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS [CRSSNP], AND 10 CRS WITH NASAL POLYPS [CRSWNP]). P-GP CONCENTRATIONS WERE DETERMINED BY ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY AND NORMALIZED TO TOTAL PROTEIN (TP). CLINICAL INDICES OF DISEASE SEVERITY, INCLUDING THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOMES TEST (SNOT-22) AND LUND-MACKAY SCORE, WERE COLLECTED FOR ALL PATIENTS. RESULTS: SECRETED P-GP CONCENTRATION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN CRS VERSUS CONTROL PATIENTS (MEAN ± STANDARD DEVIATION; 247.8 ± 224.8 VS. 102.4 ± 81.7 PCG P-GP/<U+039C>G TP, P = 0.022).

HOWEVER, THE APPROPRIATE DEGREE OF ITR IS HIGHLY DEBATABLE. METHODS: WE APPLIED INDIVIDUAL COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT)-BASED COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS (CFD) TO 5 PATIENTS RECEIVING RELATIVELY AGGRESSIVE ITR BUT WITH NO ENS SYMPTOMS, AND COMPARED THEM TO 27 SYMPTOMATIC ENS PATIENTS WHO ALL HAD HISTORIES OF AGGRESSIVE ITRS, AND 42 HEALTHY CONTROLS. PATIENTS' SURGICAL OUTCOMES WERE CONFIRMED WITH 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) (ITR: 6.40 ± 4.56; ENS: 58.2 ± 15.9; HEALTHY: 13.2 ± 14.9), NASAL OBSTRUCTION SYMPTOM EVALUATION (NOSE) SCORES (ITR: 4.00 ± 2.24; ENS: 69.4 ± 17.1; HEALTHY: 11.9 ± 12.9), AND EMPTY NOSE SYNDROME 6-ITEM QUESTIONNAIRE (ENS6Q) (=11 FOR ENS). RESULTS: BOTH AGGRESSIVE ITR WITHOUT ENS SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOMATIC ENS PATIENTS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NASAL RESISTANCE (ITR: 0.059 ± 0.020 PA·S/ML; ENS: 0.052 ± 0.015 PA·S/ML; HEALTHY: 0.070 ± 0.021 PA·S/ML) AND HIGHER CROSS-SECTIONAL AREAS SURROUNDING THE INFERIOR TURBINATE (ITR: 0.94 ± 0.21 CM(2) ; ENS: 1.19 ± 1.05 CM(2) ; HEALTHY: 0.42 ± 0.22 CM(2) ) THAN HEALTHY CONTROLS. THE LACK OF SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AMONG PATIENT GROUPS INDICATED SIMILAR DEGREES OF SURGERIES BETWEEN ITR WITH AND WITHOUT ENS SYMPTOM COHORTS. HOWEVER, SYMPTOMATIC ENS PATIENTS HAVE PARADOXICAL SIGNIFICANTLY LESS AIRFLOW IN THE INFERIOR MEATUS (ITR: 47.7% ± 23.6%; ENS: 25.8% ± 17.6%; HEALTHY: 36.5 ± 15.9%; BOTH P < 0.01), BUT HIGHER AIRFLOW AROUND THE MIDDLE MEATUS (ITR: 49.7% ± 22.6%; ENS: 66.5% ± 18.3%; HEALTHY: 49.9% ± 15.1%, P < 0.0001) THAN AGGRESSIVE ITR WITHOUT SYMPTOMS AND CONTROLS. AGGRESSIVE ITR PATIENTS HAVE INCREASED INFERIOR MEATUS AIRFLOW AS EXPECTED (P < 0.05). THIS IMBALANCED AIRFLOW PRODUCED LESS INFERIOR WALL-SHEAR-STRESS DISTRIBUTION AMONG SYMPTOMATIC ENS PATIENTS ONLY (ITR: 42.45% ± 11.4%; ENS: 32.2% ± 12.6%; HEALTHY: 49.7% ± 9.9%). ENS PATIENTS (N = 12) ALSO HAD IMPAIRED NASAL TRIGEMINAL FUNCTION, AS MEASURED BY MENTHOL LATERALIZATION DETECTION THRESHOLDS (ITR: 15.2 ± 1.2; ENS: 10.3 ± 3.9; HEALTHY: 13.8 ± 3.09, BOTH P < 0.0001). SURPRISINGLY, AGGRESSIVE ITR PATIENTS WITHOUT ENS SYMPTOMS HAVE BETTER MENTHOL LATERALIZATION DETECTION THRESHOLDS (LDTS) THAN HEALTHY CONTROLS. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH TURBINATE TISSUE LOSS IS LINKED WITH ENS, THE DEGREE OF ITR THAT MIGHT DISTINGUISH POSTOPERATIVE PATIENT SATISFACTION IN THEIR NASAL BREATHING VS DEVELOPMENT OF ENS SYMPTOMS IS UNCLEAR. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT A COMBINATION OF DISTORTED NASAL AERODYNAMICS AND LOSS OF MUCOSAL SENSORY FUNCTION MAY POTENTIALLY LEAD TO ENS SYMPTOMOLOGY.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OH.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OH.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OH.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OH.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OH.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OH.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OH.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OH.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OH.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OH.;","ORCID: 0000-0002-8379-2423 ORCID: 0000-0002-3931-3544","© 2019 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,"CONFLICT OF INTEREST: THERE ARE NO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST TO DISCLOSE.","2019/05/12 06:00","20200423","20190511",2019,"2019/05/12 06:00",NA,NA,"R01 DC013626/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/UNITED STATES","8",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (PRINT) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.22350 [DOI]","20200801","2020/04/24 06:00","NIHMS1025919",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","891-899",NA,"PMC6687526",NA,"31077575","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2019 AUG;9(8):891-899.

METHODS: PATIENTS WITH CRS, BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT POLYPS, AND COMORBID ASTHMA COMPLETED THE MINI ASTHMA QOL QUESTIONNAIRE (MINIAQLQ) AND ASTHMA CONTROL TEST (ACT) AT BASELINE AND 6 MONTHS POSTOPERATIVELY AS PART OF A MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL, PROSPECTIVE STUDY. RESULTS: BASELINE METRICS WERE AVAILABLE ON 86 PATIENTS.

THE SYSTEMIC PROFILE OF MODCS AND THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH TH1/TH2 SKEWING IN CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS) IS UNCLEAR. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO CHARACTERIZE CIRCULATING MODCS IN CONTROLS, CRS WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS (CRSSNP), AND CRS WITH NASAL POLYPS (CRSWNP) AND CORRELATE MODCS WITH TH1/TH2 SKEWING, MUCOSAL INFLAMMATION ON COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT), AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). STUDY DESIGN: CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY. SETTING: TERTIARY CARE HOSPITAL. SUBJECTS: BLOOD WAS DRAWN FROM CONTROL (N = 12), CRSSNP (N = 18), AND CRSWNP (N = 15) PATIENTS DURING ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY. METHODS: PERIPHERAL BLOOD MODCS WERE ANALYZED WITH FLOW CYTOMETRY FOR EXPRESSION OF HLA-DR, CD209, AND CD14. TH1 AND TH2 CELLS WERE IDENTIFIED BY CXCR3 AND CCR8 EXPRESSION, RESPECTIVELY. LUND-MACKAY CT SCORES WERE ASSIGNED BY BLINDED GRADERS. SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST 22 (SNOT-22) SURVEYS WERE COMPLETED BY PATIENTS BEFORE SURGERY. RESULTS: CRSSNP AND CRSWNP DISPLAYED ELEVATIONS IN SYSTEMIC MODCS COMPARED WITH CONTROLS. IN CRSWNP, SYSTEMIC TH2 SKEWING WAS OBSERVED AND CIRCULATING CD4+ TH2 CELLS CORRELATED WITH PERCENT MODCS. MODCS STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH HIGHER LUND-MACKAY CT SCORES IN CRSSNP BUT NOT IN CRSWNP. NO RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MODCS AND SNOT-22 SCORES WAS OBSERVED FOR EITHER SUBSET OF CRS. CONCLUSION: THESE DATA SUPPORT THAT CRSWNP AND CRSSNP DISPLAY ALTERATIONS IN SYSTEMIC IMMUNE PROFILES. CRSWNP IS CHARACTERIZED BY SIGNIFICANT ELEVATIONS IN CIRCULATING MODCS, WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH SYSTEMIC TH2-BIASED INFLAMMATION. CIRCULATING MODCS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH MUCOSAL INFLAMMATION ON CT IMAGING IN CRSSNP.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EVALUATE THE OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE EFFECT OF THE TITANIUM BUTTERFLY IMPLANT ON NASAL PATENCY AND CORRESPONDING QUALITY OF LIFE. METHODS: NASAL PATENCY AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF 32 PATIENTS UNDERGOING A TITANIUM BUTTERFLY IMPLANT WERE EVALUATED BY MEASURING PEAK NASAL INSPIRATORY FLOW (PNIF) AND COMPLETING THREE VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRES: THE NOSE, SNOT-22 AND GBI, BEFORE SURGERY, SIX WEEKS AND SIX MONTHS AFTER SURGERY. RESULTS: THE MEAN PNIF INCREASED SIGNIFICANT AFTER 6 WEEKS, AS WELL AS AFTER 6 MONTHS. BOTH THE NOSE AND SNOT-22 QUESTIONNAIRE SCORES SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE AT BOTH POST-OPERATIVE MEASUREMENTS. THE GBI INDICATED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE AT 6 WEEKS AND 6 MONTHS. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BOTH OF THE POST-OPERATIVE MEASUREMENTS.

HOWEVER, THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MENTAL HEALTH AND PATIENT SATISFACTION WITH FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES OF RHINOPLASTY IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE WHETHER PREOPERATIVE MENTAL HEALTH IS ASSOCIATED WITH SATISFACTION WITH FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES OF RHINOPLASTY. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: THIS CASE-CONTROL STUDY ASSESSED BASELINE NASAL FUNCTION AND POSTSURGICAL FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES FOR 88 CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS UNDERGOING RHINOPLASTY WITH BOTH COSMETIC AND FUNCTIONAL GOALS AT 2 TERTIARY RHINOLOGIC CENTERS IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA. EXPOSURES: POOR MENTAL WELL-BEING WAS DEFINED PREOPERATIVELY BY THE OPTUM SF-36V2 HEALTH SURVEY MENTAL COMPONENT SUMMARY. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: NASAL FUNCTION WAS ASSESSED WITH PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME MEASURES, INCLUDING VISUAL ANALOG SCALES, THE NASAL OBSTRUCTION SYMPTOM EVALUATION SCALE (NOSE), THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), AND LIKERT SCALES. OBJECTIVE OUTCOMES INCLUDED NASAL PEAK INSPIRATORY FLOW, NASAL AIRWAY RESISTANCE, AND MINIMUM CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA. ALL OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED PREOPERATIVELY AND 6 MONTHS POSTOPERATIVELY. THE 36-ITEM OPTUM SF-36V2 HEALTH SURVEY MENTAL COMPONENT SUMMARY WAS USED TO ASSESS MENTAL WELL-BEING, WITH A SCORE OF LESS THAN 40 INDICATING POOR MENTAL WELL-BEING AND A SCORE 40 OR HIGHER INDICATING NORMAL WELL-BEING. RESULTS: MEAN (SD) PATIENT AGE WAS 37.6 (12.9) YEARS AND 53 OF 88 (60.2%) WERE WOMEN. THE MENTAL COMPONENT SUMMARY DEFINED IMPAIRED WELL-BEING IN N = 24 (CASES) AND NORMAL WELL-BEING IN N = 64 (CONTROLS). THERE WERE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE TOTAL STUDY POPULATION ACROSS MOST NASAL FUNCTION OUTCOMES AND IN BOTH GROUPS. AFTER RHINOPLASTY, BENEFIT WAS SEEN FOR BOTH GROUPS IN VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (LEFT SIDE MEAN [SD] CHANGE, 18 [30]; P < .001 AND RIGHT SIDE MEAN [SD] CHANGE, 24 [30]; P < .001); NOSE (MEAN [SD] CHANGE, 1.35 [1.21]; P < .001); AND SNOT-22 (MEAN [SD] CHANGE, 0.81 [0.88]; P < .001) SCORES. NASAL PEAK INSPIRATORY FLOW IMPROVED FOR BOTH GROUPS (MEAN [SD] CHANGE, 32 [45] L/MIN; P < .001), WHILE NASAL AIRWAY RESISTANCE AND MINIMUM CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA REMAINED SIMILAR (CHANGE IN NASAL AIRWAY RESISTANCE, 0.086 PA/CM3/S; 95% CI, -0.007 PA/CM3/S TO 0.179 PA/CM3/S AND CHANGE IN MINIMUM CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA, -0.04 CM2; 95% CI, -0.21 CM2 TO 0.13 CM2). PATIENTS WITH POOR MENTAL HEALTH HAD SIMILAR IMPROVEMENTS IN NASAL FUNCTION COMPARED WITH CONTROLS. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: RHINOPLASTY IMPARTS SIMILAR BENEFITS TO NASAL FUNCTION ASSESSED BY PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME MEASURES AND OBJECTIVE AIRFLOW MEASURES REGARDLESS OF PREOPERATIVE MENTAL HEALTH STATUS.

METHODS: INDIVIDUAL COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT)-BASED COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS (CFD) WAS APPLIED TO 27 ENS PATIENTS TO SIMULATE THEIR NASAL AERODYNAMICS AND COMPARED WITH 42 HEALTHY CONTROLS. PATIENTS' SYMPTOMS WERE CONFIRMED WITH EMPTY NOSE SYNDROME 6-ITEM QUESTIONNAIRE (ENS6Q), 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), AND NASAL OBSTRUCTION SYMPTOM EVALUATION (NOSE) SCORES. NASAL TRIGEMINAL SENSITIVITY WAS MEASURED WITH MENTHOL LATERALIZATION DETECTION THRESHOLDS (LDTS). RESULTS: ENS PATIENTS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER (~25.7%) NASAL RESISTANCE AND HIGHER (~2.8 TIMES) CROSS-SECTIONAL AREAS COMPARED TO HEALTHY CONTROLS (BOTH P < 0.001). DESPITE INFERIOR TURBINATE REDUCTIONS, CFD ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATED THAT ENS PATIENTS HAD INCREASED AIRFLOW CONCENTRATED IN THE MIDDLE MEATUS REGION (66.5% ± 18.3%) COMPARED TO HEALTHY CONTROLS (49.9% ± 15.1%, P < 0.0001). SIGNIFICANTLY LESS AIRFLOW (25.8% ± 17.6%) AND LOWER PEAK WALL SHEAR STRESS (WSS) (0.58 ± 0.24 PA) WERE FOUND IN THE INFERIOR MEATUS (VS HEALTHY: 36.5% ± 15.9%; 1.18 ± 0.81 PA, BOTH P < 0.05), WITH THE LATTER SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH THE SYMPTOM SCORES OF ENS6Q (R = -0.398, P = 0.003). ITEM-WISE, COMPLAINTS OF \"SUFFOCATION\" AND \"NOSE FEELS TOO OPEN\" WERE ALSO FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH PEAK WSS AROUND THE INFERIOR TURBINATE (R = -0.295, P = 0.031; AND R = -0.388, P = 0.004, RESPECTIVELY). THESE CORRELATIONS WERE ALL NEGATIVE, INDICATING THAT LESS AIR-MUCOSAL STIMULATIONS RESULTED IN WORSE SYMPTOM SCORES. ENS PATIENTS (N = 12) ALSO HAD IMPAIRED MENTHOL LDT WHEN COMPARED TO HEALTHY CONTROLS (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: THIS IS THE FIRST CFD EXAMINATION OF NASAL AERODYNAMICS IN A LARGE COHORT OF ENS PATIENTS. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT A COMBINATION OF LOSS OF NEURAL SENSITIVITY AND POORER INFERIOR AIR-MUCOSAL STIMULATION MAY POTENTIALLY LEAD TO ENS SYMPTOMOLOGY.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OH.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OH.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OH.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OH.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OH.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OH.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY, PHILADELPHIA, PA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OH.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OH.; DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OH.;","ORCID: 0000-0002-8379-2423","© 2017 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,"THE AUTHORS HAVE NO FINANCIAL INTEREST AND CONFLICT OF INTEREST TO DISCLOSE.","2017/11/23 06:00","20190214","20171122",2018,"2017/11/23 06:00",NA,NA,"R01 DC013626/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/UNITED STATES","3",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (PRINT) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.22045 [DOI]","20190301","2019/02/15 06:00","NIHMS974568",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","444-452",NA,"PMC6015742",NA,"29165896","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2018 MAR;8(3):444-452.

DURING THE PRECEDING DECADE, GREATER AWARENESS HAS FOCUSED NOT ONLY ON THE SYMPTOMS BUT ALSO ON PATIENTS' QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF SEPTOPLASTY, AS MEASURED BY GENERIC AND DISEASE-SPECIFIC QOL QUESTIONNAIRES. THE GENERIC 15D AND DISEASE-SPECIFIC SNOT-22 QUESTIONNAIRES WERE GIVEN TO PATIENTS BEFORE THE OPERATION AND 6 MONTHS AFTER THE OPERATION. DATA ANALYSIS CONSISTED ORIGINALLY OF 188 SEPTOPLASTY PATIENTS. ONE-HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SIX PATIENTS (67%) ANSWERED THE SNOT-22 QUESTIONS, AND IN THE 15D, THE RESPONSE RATE WAS 76%. IN THE POST-OPERATIVE SNOT-22, THE NEED TO BLOW THE NOSE, SNEEZING, RUNNY NOSE, NASAL OBSTRUCTION, LOSS OF SMELL OR TASTE, POST-NASAL DISCHARGE, FACIAL PAIN/PRESSURE, DIFFICULTY IN FALLING ASLEEP AND WAKING UP AT NIGHT IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY. HOWEVER IN THE 15D THE MEAN QOL, I.E., GENERAL WELL-BEING, BECAME SIGNIFICANTLY POORER. THE QOL BECAME INCREASINGLY POOR ESPECIALLY IN THE OLDER AGE GROUPS AND AMONG THE PATIENTS IN WHICH THE IMPROVEMENT ACHIEVED IN NASAL SYMPTOMS POSTOPERATIVELY WAS MINOR. THE MORE NASAL SYMPTOMS THE PATIENTS HAD PRE- OR POSTOPERATIVELY, THE POORER THE QOL WAS IN GENERAL. BASED ON OUR RESULTS, CRITICAL EVALUATION OF THE SYMPTOMS AND FINDINGS IN THE PATIENTS IS ESSENTIAL IN DECIDING WHETHER SURGERY OR OTHER TREATMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS HAVING NASAL BLOCKAGE SYMPTOMS. ESPECIALLY IN PATIENTS WITH MILD SYMPTOMS OR AMONG OLDER PATIENTS, ADEQUATE MEDICAL TREATMENT HAS TO BE TRIED BEFORE EVEN CONSIDERING SURGERY. THE RESULTS ALSO ENCOURAGE THE USE OF A SYSTEMATIC QUESTIONNAIRE TO ESTIMATE THE SEVERITY OF SYMPTOMS IN DAILY CLINICAL PRACTICE.","DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, HELSINKI UNIVERSITY CENTRAL HOSPITAL AND UNIVERSITY OF HELSINKI, P.;O.; BOX 220, 00029 HELSINKI, HUS, FINLAND.; MAIJA.;HYTONEN@HUS.;FI",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2012/01/26 06:00","20130503","20120125",2012,"2012/01/26 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"12",NA,"1434-4726 (ELECTRONIC) 0937-4477 (LINKING)","9002937","EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY : OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN FEDERATION OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGICAL SOCIETIES (EUFOS) : AFFILIATED WITH THE GERMAN SOCIETY FOR OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY","ENG","10.1007/S00405-012-1931-9 [DOI]","20211021","2013/05/04 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","2497-503","GERMANY",NA,NA,"22274692","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"EUR ARCH OTORHINOLARYNGOL. 2012 DEC;269(12):2497-503.

METHODS: PATIENTS UNDERGOING ADENOIDECTOMY-ONLY FOR OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA (N = 50) AND CRS (N = 37) WERE RECRUITED. PREOPERATIVE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) OR SINUS AND NASAL QUALITY OF LIFE SURVEY (SN-5) WERE COLLECTED. EACH PATIENT HAD SAMPLES COLLECTED FROM THEIR NASOPHARYNX (ADENOID BED) AND NASAL CAVITY (SINUS) AT THE ONSET OF SURGERY. 16S RIBOSOMAL RIBONUCLEIC ACID (RRNA) GENE SEQUENCING WAS SUBSEQUENTLY PERFORMED TO OBTAIN PER SAMPLE TAXONOMIC ABUNDANCES. STATISTICAL ANALYSES INCLUDED PERMUTATIONAL MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (PERMANOVA), ALPHA (WITHIN SAMPLE) DIVERSITY MEASURES, AND CHANGES IN TAXONOMIC ABUNDANCE. RESULTS: MORAXELLA WAS THE MOST ABUNDANT ORGANISM. NASOPHARYNGEAL SWABS DEMONSTRATED HIGHER ALPHA DIVERSITY COMPARED TO THE NASAL CAVITY. THE DIVERSITY WAS NOT DIFFERENT BASED ON CRS VS OBSTRUCTIVE HISTORY. THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN DIVERSITY WITH INCREASING AGE, AND ECZEMA CONTRIBUTED TO A GREATER DIFFERENCE IN DIVERSITY BETWEEN THE NASOPHARYNX AND NASAL CAVITY. DIVERSITY WAS NOT AFFECTED BY ADENOID SIZE; HOWEVER, USE OF NASAL STEROIDS, INHALED STEROIDS, AND ANTIHISTAMINES INFLUENCED DIVERSITY IN BOTH THE NASOPHARYNX AND NASAL CAVITY. NASOPHARYNGEAL SAMPLES WERE HIGHER IN RELATIVE ABUNDANCE FOR FUSOBACTERIUM, PREVOTELLA, PORPHYROMONAS, AND CAMPYLOBACTER COMPARED TO THE NASAL CAVITY. CONCLUSION: THE NASOPHARYNX AND NASAL CAVITY DIFFERED IN BOTH MICROBIOTA COMPOSITION AND DIVERSITY. IN CONTRAST, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN COMPOSITION OR DIVERSITY WERE FOUND IN CRS VS CONTROL PATIENTS.

THIS STUDY AIMED TO ASSESS THE 3-YEAR CLINICAL EFFICACY, SAFETY, AND SATISFACTORY DEGREE OF BALLOON SINUPLASTY THROUGH MULTIPLE ASPECTS. ALSO THE EXPERIENCE ABOUT TREATMENT FOR POSTOPERATIVE ADHESION WAS DESCRIBED. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A STUDY WAS PERFORMED IN 30 CHILDREN WHO HAD FAILED MEDICAL THERAPY, AND RECEIVED BALLOON SINUPLASTY OF SELECTED SINUSES. DATA IN 3-YEAR FOLLOW-UP INCLUDING QUESTIONNAIRE, VAS, CT, AND NASAL ENDOSCOPY FINDINGS WERE COLLECTED. ALSO POSTOPERATIVE NOSE-RELATED MEDICATIONS OR AUXILIARY THERAPIES, REVISION SURGERY, AND INCIDENCE OF COMPLICATIONS WERE COLLECTED. THE SATISFACTORY DEGREE OF CHILDREN AND PARENTS WERE ASSESSED. RESULTS: COMPARED TO PREOPERATIVE, THE VAS SCORES, QUESTIONNAIRE (SN-5 OR SNOT-22) SCORES AND LUND-MACKAY SCORES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER. IN THE 3-YEAR FOLLOW-UP, MOST OF THEM DID NOT REQUIRE NOSE-RELATED MEDICATIONS OR AUXILIARY THERAPIES, AND WERE FREE OF SYMPTOMS, OR THE SYMPTOMS DID NOT AFFECT THEIR DAILY ACTIVITIES. NONE OF THE 30 CHILDREN HAD COMPLICATIONS OF FACIAL PAIN, TEETH NUMBNESS, FACIAL DEFORMITY, AND DYSOSMIA. HOWEVER, NASAL CAVITY ADHESION STILL REMAINED THE MOST FREQUENT. THE SATISFACTORY DEGREE WAS RELATIVELY HIGH. CONCLUSION: THE 3-YEAR FOLLOW-UP DEMONSTRATED THAT BALLOON SINUPLASTY HAD HIGH CLINICAL EFFICACY AND SAFETY, THE SATISFACTORY DEGREE OF CHILDREN AND PARENTS REMAINED RELATIVELY HIGH. IMPROVED THE UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTION AND INCREASED THE IMMUNITY, WHICH WERE CONSIDERED EFFECTIVE METHODS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF RECURRENCE.

GUIDELINES ARE CONFLICTING REGARDING WHETHER ANTIBIOTICS SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN PRIMARY MEDICAL MANAGEMENT, REFLECTING THE LACK OF EVIDENCE IN SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS. INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO INFORM THE ROLE OF SURGERY CONTRIBUTES TO A FIVEFOLD VARIATION IN UK INTERVENTION RATES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS TRIAL IS TO ESTABLISH THE COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS) OR A PROLONGED COURSE OF ANTIBIOTICS (CLARITHROMYCIN) IN ADULT PATIENTS WITH CRS IN TERMS OF SYMPTOMATIC IMPROVEMENT AND COSTS TO THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE COMPARED WITH STANDARD MEDICAL CARE (INTRANASAL MEDICATION) AT 6 MONTHS. METHODS/DESIGN: A THREE-ARM PARALLEL-GROUP TRIAL WILL BE CONDUCTED WITH PATIENTS WHO REMAIN SYMPTOMATIC AFTER RECEIVING APPROPRIATE MEDICAL THERAPY (EITHER IN PRIMARY OR SECONDARY CARE). THEY WILL BE RANDOMISED TO RECEIVE: (1) INTRANASAL MEDICATION PLUS ESS, (2) INTRANASAL MEDICATION PLUS CLARITHROMYCIN (250 MG) OR (3) INTRANASAL MEDICATION PLUS A PLACEBO. INTRANASAL MEDICATION (CURRENT STANDARD MEDICAL CARE) IS DEFINED AS A SPRAY OR DROPS OF INTRANASAL CORTICOSTEROIDS AND SALINE IRRIGATIONS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE IS THE SNOT-22 QUESTIONNAIRE, WHICH ASSESSES DISEASE-SPECIFIC HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. THE STUDY SAMPLE SIZE IS 600. PRINCIPAL ANALYSES WILL BE ACCORDING TO THE RANDOMISED GROUPS IRRESPECTIVE OF COMPLIANCE. THE TRIAL WILL BE CONDUCTED IN AT LEAST 16 SECONDARY OR TERTIARY CARE CENTRES WITH AN INTERNAL PILOT AT SIX SITES FOR 6 MONTHS. DISCUSSION: THE POTENTIAL CARDIOVASCULAR SIDE EFFECTS OF MACROLIDE ANTIBIOTICS HAVE BEEN RECENTLY HIGHLIGHTED. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANTIBIOTICS WILL BE ESTABLISHED THROUGH THIS TRIAL, WHICH MAY HELP TO REDUCE UNNECESSARY USAGE AND POTENTIAL MORBIDITY. IF ESS IS SHOWN TO BE CLINICALLY EFFECTIVE AND COST-EFFECTIVE, THE TRIAL MAY ENCOURAGE EARLIER INTERVENTION. IN CONTRAST, IF IT IS SHOWN TO BE INEFFECTIVE, THEN THERE SHOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SURGERY RATES. THE TRIAL RESULTS WILL FEED INTO THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE MACRO RESEARCH PROGRAMME TO ESTABLISH BEST PRACTICE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF ADULTS WITH CRS AND DESIGN THE IDEAL PATIENT PATHWAY ACROSS PRIMARY AND SECONDARY CARE.

WE FOUND REDUCTION OF PATIENT SYMPTOMS IN ETD QUESTIONNAIRE (P<.001), POSTOPERATIVE NORMALIZATION OF THE TYMPANIC MEMBRANE, CONVERSION OF TYPE B OR TYPE C INTO TYPE A TYMPANOGRAMS, REDUCED MUCOSAL INFLAMMATION, INCREASED NUMBER OF POSITIVE VALSALVA TEST AND SWALLOWING TESTS, IMPROVEMENT IN EUSTACHIAN TUBE SCORE, REDUCTION IN SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT)-22 SCORE (P=.001), AND INCREASED QUALITY OF LIFE (P=.001). NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS WERE FOUND. CONCLUSION: THE EVIDENCE OF BET IS POOR AND BIASED. NO FIRM CONCLUSIONS CAN BE MADE TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THE PROCEDURE OR TO ACCURATELY PREDICT SURGICAL RESULTS.

ALTHOUGH ODS CASE SERIES HAVE SHOWN SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES WITH DENTAL TREATMENT AND ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (ESS), NO STUDIES HAVE CONSIDERED THE OPTIMAL TIMING OF THESE TREATMENTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ANALYZE TIMES TO ODS RESOLUTION AFTER PRIMARY DENTAL TREATMENT AND ESS BASED ON SYMPTOM, 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), AND ENDOSCOPIC OUTCOMES. STUDY DESIGN: PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. METHODS: THIRTY-SEVEN SYMPTOMATIC ODS PATIENTS WHO FAILED MEDICAL MANAGEMENT WERE OFFERED PRIMARY DENTAL TREATMENT OR ESS. ELEVEN PATIENTS SELECTED PRIMARY DENTAL TREATMENT, AND 26 PATIENTS SELECTED ESS. THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES WERE COLLECTED PROSPECTIVELY AT EVERY OFFICE VISIT BEFORE AND AFTER DENTAL TREATMENT OR ESS: SNOT-22, PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF CARDINAL SINUSITIS SYMPTOMS, AND PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF MIDDLE MEATAL ENDOSCOPY FINDINGS (EDEMA, POLYPS, PURULENCE). TIMES TO RESOLUTION OF THESE CLINICAL VARIABLES WERE ANALYZED WITH T TEST, CHI-SQUARE TEST, FISHER EXACT TEST, MCNEMAR TEST, AND KAPLAN-MEIER SURVIVAL ANALYSIS. RESULTS: PATIENTS IN THE DENTAL TREATMENT AND ESS GROUPS SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN PREOPERATIVE SINUSITIS DISEASE BURDENS BASED ON SYMPTOMS, SNOT-22, ENDOSCOPY, AND COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY. THE ESS GROUP EXPERIENCED FASTER AND MORE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN NEARLY ALL SYMPTOM, SNOT-22, AND ENDOSCOPIC OUTCOMES. CONCLUSIONS: FOR SYMPTOMATIC ODS, PRIMARY ESS RESULTED IN FASTER RESOLUTION OF SNOT-22, SINUSITIS SYMPTOMS, AND ENDOSCOPIC FINDINGS IN ODS PATIENTS COMPARED WITH PRIMARY DENTAL TREATMENT.

WE EVALUATED THE SNOT-22 SCORE AS A QUALITY-OF-LIFE OUTCOME MEASURE IN SEPTORHINOPLASTY SURGERY. STUDY DESIGN: OUTCOME RESEARCH. METHODS: WE CARRIED OUT A PROSPECTIVE CASE SERIES IN 76 PATIENTS UNDERGOING SEPTORHINOPLASTY. THEIR SNOT-22 SCORES WERE COMPARED PRE- AND POSTOPERATIVELY. WE ALSO RECORDED INDIVIDUAL SYMPTOM SCORES TO STUDY THE IMPACT OF SURGERY. TO CHECK ITS RELIABILITY, THE SNOT-22 SCORE WAS CORRELATED TO PATIENT-REPORTED SYMPTOMS ON A VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE. PATIENTS WERE SCREENED FOR COMORBID CONDITIONS. INTERACTIONS WITH THE SURGICAL TECHNIQUE AND/OR WITH THE INITIAL SINONASAL DISEASE WERE SOUGHT. RESULTS: THE SNOT-22 IS A RELIABLE AND RESPONSIVE OUTCOME MEASURE IN SEPTORHINOPLASTY SURGERY. SEPTORHINOPLASTY WAS ESPECIALLY EFFECTIVE AT ADDRESSING NASAL OBSTRUCTION, DISCHARGE, OLFACTION, RELATED SLEEP DISTURBANCE, AND EMOTIONAL SYMPTOMS SUCH AS EMBARRASSMENT OR FRUSTRATION. COMPARISON TO THE VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE INSTRUMENT CONFIRMED THE OUTCOME MEASURED BY THE SNOT-22.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY GENOTYPIC AND PHENOTYPIC FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH CF THAT ARE PREDICTIVE OF SINONASAL DISEASE, RECURRENT NASAL POLYPOSIS, AND FAILURE TO RESPOND TO STANDARD TREATMENT. METHODS: A RETROSPECTIVE CASE SERIES WAS CONDUCTED OF 30 PEDIATRIC PATIENTS WITH CF CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITH AND WITHOUT POLYPS. PATIENT SPECIFIC MUTATIONS WERE DIVIDED BY CLASS AND CATEGORIZED INTO HIGH RISK (CLASS I-III) AND LOW RISK (CLASS IV-V). SEVERITY OF PULMONARY AND PANCREATIC MANIFESTATIONS OF CF, NUMBER OF SINUS SURGERIES, NASAL POLYPOSIS AND RECURRENCE, AGE AT PRESENTATION TO OTOLARYNGOLOGY, AND PEDIATRIC SINONASAL SYMPTOM SURVEY (SN-5)/SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES WERE EXAMINED. RESULTS: 27/30 PATIENTS (90%) HAD HIGH RISK MUTATIONS (CLASS I-III). 21/30 (70.0%) PATIENTS HAD NASAL POLYPOSIS AND 10/30 (33.3%) HAD RECURRENT NASAL POLYPOSIS.

THE PRE- AND POSTOPERATIVE 6-MONTH MEAN VALUES OF FIRST MINIMAL CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA (MCA1), SECOND MINIMAL CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA (MCA2), THE DISTANCE FROM THE TIP OF THE PROBE TO THE FIRST MINIMAL CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA, THE DISTANCE FROM THE TIP OF THE PROBE TO THE SECOND MINIMAL CROSS SECTIONAL AREA, NASAL VOLUME 1, AND NASAL VOLUME 2 WERE MEASURED. FACIAL ANALYSIS WAS MADE WITH THE RHINOBASE SOFTWARE, DESIGNED FOR FACIAL ANALYSIS. RESULTS: THE MEAN PRE- AND POSTOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORES WERE 25.55 ± 6.64 AND 15.70 ± 8.11, RESPECTIVELY (P < .05). THE MEAN PRE- AND POSTOPERATIVE NASOLABIAL ANGLES WERE 82.26º ± 5.69º AND 101.47º ± 7.70º, RESPECTIVELY (P < .05). THE MEAN PRE- AND POSTOPERATIVE NASOFRONTAL ANGLES WERE 144.30º ± 3.81º AND 138.25º ± 3.26º, RESPECTIVELY (P < .05). THE MEAN PRE- AND POSTOPERATIVE NASAL LENGTH WAS 54.22 ± 4.62 MM AND 49.95 ± 2.75 MM, RESPECTIVELY (P < .05). THE MEAN PRE- AND POSTOPERATIVE TIP PROJECTION WAS 25.77 ± 3.64 MM AND 28.40 ± 2.97 MM, RESPECTIVELY (P < .05). ONLY POSTOPERATIVE MCA2 VALUES ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT SIDE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM PREOPERATIVE MCA2 VALUES (P < .05). NONE OF THE REMAINING POSTOPERATIVE ACOUSTIC RHINOMETRY SCORES SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERED FROM PREOPERATIVE SCORES. TWO PATIENTS (10%) REQUIRED REVISION AT AROUND 1 MONTH AFTER SURGERY DUE TO SUTURE LOOSENING AND BREAKAGE. CONCLUSIONS: ESPECIALLY IN THE ERA OF MINIMAL INVASIVE SURGERY, TRANSCUTANEOUS SUSPENSION TIP PLASTY IS PROMISING, WITH RAPID AND RELIABLE FUNCTIONAL AND COSMETIC RESULTS. FURTHER STUDIES WITH LONGER FOLLOW-UP DURATIONS ARE NEEDED TO ASSESS THE LONG-TERM OUTCOMES OF THIS TECHNIQUE.","1 OTOLARYNGOLOGY DEPARTMENT, EGE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, IZMIR, TURKEY.; 1 OTOLARYNGOLOGY DEPARTMENT, EGE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, IZMIR, TURKEY.; 1 OTOLARYNGOLOGY DEPARTMENT, EGE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, IZMIR, TURKEY.; 1 OTOLARYNGOLOGY DEPARTMENT, EGE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, IZMIR, TURKEY.; 1 OTOLARYNGOLOGY DEPARTMENT, EGE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, IZMIR, TURKEY.; 2 OTOLARYNGOLOGY DEPARTMENT, ADNAN MENDERES SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, AYDIN, TURKEY.; 1 OTOLARYNGOLOGY DEPARTMENT, EGE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, IZMIR, TURKEY.;","ORCID: 0000-0003-0020-1921",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019/04/23 06:00","20190819","20190421",2019,"2019/04/23 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"9",NA,"1943-572X (ELECTRONIC) 0003-4894 (LINKING)","0407300","THE ANNALS OF OTOLOGY, RHINOLOGY, AND LARYNGOLOGY","ENG","10.1177/0003489419843549 [DOI]","20190819","2019/08/20 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","789-794","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"31007036","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"ANN OTOL RHINOL LARYNGOL. 2019 SEP;128(9):789-794.

WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT SOFTWARE-AIDED, QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENT OF SINUS INFLAMMATION WOULD GENERATE A METRIC OF DISEASE BURDEN THAT WOULD CORRELATE WITH CLINICAL PARAMETERS IN PATIENTS WITH SUSPECTED SINUS DISEASE. METHODS: ADULTS WITH RHINOLOGIC COMPLAINTS UNDERGOING COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY IMAGING WERE RECRUITED AT AN URBAN, ACADEMIC, TERTIARY CARE CENTER (N = 45 WITH LUND-MACKAY [LM] SCORES =4). THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) VOLUMETRIC IMAGE ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED USING A SEMIAUTOMATED METHOD TO OBTAIN A \"CHICAGO-MODIFIED LUND-MACKAY\" (CHICAGO MLM) SCORE, WHICH PROVIDES A CONTINUOUS SCALE TO QUANTIFY EXTENT OF OPACIFICATION. LINEAR REGRESSION WAS USED TO TEST THE ASSOCIATION OF THE CHICAGO MLM SCORE WITH CONCURRENT SYMPTOMS (TOTAL NASAL SYMPTOM SCORE [TNSS]) AND DISEASE-SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE, BASED ON THE SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22). RESULTS: CHICAGO MLM SCORES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH SYMPTOMS (P = 0.037) AND DISEASE-SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE (P = 0.007). INFLAMMATION IN THE ETHMOID AND SPHENOID SINUSES APPEARED TO INFLUENCE THESE ASSOCIATIONS. THESE FINDINGS WERE EVEN MORE ROBUST WHEN ANALYSIS WAS LIMITED TO PATIENTS WITH MORE SEVERE DISEASE (LM >6). CONCLUSION: THE QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENT OF SINUS INFLAMMATION BY COMPUTER-AIDED 3D ANALYSIS CORRELATES MODESTLY WITH BOTH SYMPTOMS AND DISEASE-SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE. POSTERIOR SINUSES APPEAR TO HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT ON THESE FINDINGS, POTENTIALLY PROVIDING AN ANATOMIC TARGET FOR CLINICIANS TO BASE THERAPY. THE CHICAGO MLM SCORE IS A PROMISING IMAGING BIOMARKER FOR CLINICAL AND RESEARCH USE.","PRITZKER SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, CHICAGO, IL.; PRITZKER SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, CHICAGO, IL.; PRITZKER SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, CHICAGO, IL.; DEPARTMENT OF RADIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, CHICAGO, IL.; SECTION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, CHICAGO, IL.; DEPARTMENT OF RADIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, CHICAGO, IL.; SECTION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, CHICAGO, IL.; DEPARTMENT OF RADIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, CHICAGO, IL.; SECTION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, CHICAGO, IL.; CENTER ON DEMOGRAPHY AND ECONOMICS OF AGING, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, CHICAGO, IL.;","ORCID: 0000-0001-5955-4268","© 2017 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,"DISCLOSURE: SGA RECEIVES LOYALTIES AND LICENSING FEES THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO FOR COMPUTER-AIDED DIAGNOSIS TECHNOLOGY.

WE INVESTIGATE RISK FACTORS AND OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH REVISION ESS (RESS) AFTER ENDOSCOPIC SKULL-BASE SURGERY (SBS) FOR NEOPLASMS WITH COMBINED SINONASAL AND SKULL BASE INVOLVEMENT. METHODS: A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF PATIENTS WITH NEOPLASMS WITH BOTH SINONASAL AND SKULL BASE INVOLVEMENT WHO UNDERWENT ENDOSCOPIC RESECTION AT A SINGLE TERTIARY CARE ACADEMIC INSTITUTION FROM 2004 THROUGH 2017 WAS PERFORMED. EIGHTY-THREE PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED INCIDENCE AND TIMING OF REVISION SURGERY, LUND-MACKAY (LM) SCORES, AND 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES. RESULTS: RESS WAS PERFORMED IN 21 (25%) CASES, 15 (18%) OF WHICH WERE DUE TO CRS. TIME BETWEEN INITIAL RESECTION AND RESS WAS AN AVERAGE OF 42 MONTHS (RANGE, 6 TO 142 MONTHS). PRE-SBS AND POST-SBS LM SCORES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT (5.0 VS 4.7, P = 0.640), ALTHOUGH PRE-SBS AND POST-SBS SNOT-22 SCORES SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT (32.6 VS 24.5, P = 0.030).

PURPOSE OF STUDY: IS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE METHOD OF RESTORING THE MEDIAL WALL OF THE MS WITH AN AUTOGRAFT - A QUADRANGULAR CARTILAGE OF THE NASAL SEPTUM USING THE BUTTERFLY TECHNIQUE (PATENT APPLICATION NO. 2018140468, PRIORITY OF 11/19/2018). MATERIAL AND METHODS: THE STUDY INCLUDED PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT SEPTOPLASTY, ENDOSCOPIC SURGERY ON THE MS WITH PLASTY OF THE MEDIAL WALL OF THE MS (1ST, MAIN GROUP, N=136), AS WELL AS PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT SURGERY ACCORDING TO CALDWELL-LUC WITH THE FORMATION OF PERSISTENT NASOANTRAL ANASTOMOSIS IN THE LOWER NASAL PASSAGE (2ND, CONTROL GROUP, N=56). THE CRITERIA FOR THE INCLUSION OF PATIENTS IN THE STUDY WERE AS FOLLOWS: THE PRESENCE OF MS FUNGAL BODY; INVERTED PAPILLOMA WITH LESIONS OF THE MS; CYSTS AND/OR A FOREIGN BODY OF THE MS WITH LOCALIZATION IN THE ALVEOLAR BAY WITHOUT INVOLVING THE NATURAL ANASTOMOSIS IN THE PATHOLOGICAL PROCESS; CONCOMITANT 3RD OR 4TH, OR 5TH OR 6TH TYPES OF CURVATURE OF THE NASAL SEPTUM ACCORDING TO R. MLADINA (1987). AN OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE CONDITION OF THE PATIENTS WAS CARRIED OUT USING THE SNOT-22 CLINICAL QUESTIONNAIRE, AND FOR ANALYSIS THE STATE OF AERODYNAMICS OF THE NASAL CAVITY AND MS IN PATIENTS OF VARIOUS GROUPS AFTER SURGICAL TREATMENT USED THE METHOD OF COMPUTATIONAL AERODYNAMICS. RESULTS: IN PATIENTS WITH NASOANTRAL OSTIUM IN THE LOWER NASAL MEATUS, THE PATHOLOGICAL MAXILLARY SINUS AERATION ONE WAS OBSERVED. IT IS RECOMMENDED TO CLOSE THE NASOANTRAL OSTIUM TO PREVENT VIOLATIONS OF THE AERODYNAMICS OF THE NASAL CAVITY AND THE MAXILLARY SINUS DURING SURGERY THROUGH THE LOWER NASAL MEATUS. CONCLUSION: OUR PROPOSED METHOD FOR CLOSING A DEFECT IN THE LOWER NASAL PASSAGE IS EFFECTIVE. THE AUTOGRAFT IS WELL ESTABLISHED, CONTRIBUTES TO THE SPEEDY RESTORATION OF NORMAL SINUS AERODYNAMICS.","ALL-RUSSIAN CENTER FOR EYE AND PLASTIC SURGERY OF THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH OF RUSSIA, UFA, RUSSIA.; NEFTYANIK HOSPITAL, TYUMEN, RUSSIA.; SVERZHEVSKY RESEARCH CLINICAL INSTITUTE OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY OF THE MOSCOW HEALTHCARE DEPARTMENT, MOSCOW, RUSSIA.;","ORCID: 0000-0002-4334-3789 ORCID: 0000-0003-1098-9492 ORCID: 0000-0002-9164-6282",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020/06/02 06:00","20200826",NA,2020,"2020/06/02 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"2",NA,"0042-4668 (PRINT) 0042-4668 (LINKING)","0416577","VESTNIK OTORINOLARINGOLOGII","RUS","10.17116/OTORINO20208502137 [DOI]","20200826","2020/08/28 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","37-40","RUSSIA (FEDERATION)",NA,NA,"32476387","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"VESTN OTORINOLARINGOL. 2020;85(2):37-40.

IMPAIRED SINONASAL VISUALIZATION DUE TO MUCOSAL BLEEDING MAY BE BURDENSOME IN CASES OF CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS) WITH HIGH-GRADE INFLAMMATORY DISEASE, SUGGESTING A ROLE FOR TIVA IN THAT DISEASE SUBGROUP. METHODS: A DOUBLE-BLIND, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED OF ADULTS UNDERGOING ESS AT A TERTIARY MEDICAL CENTER. PATIENTS CONSIDERED FOR INCLUSION HAD HIGH-GRADE CRS DEFINED AS EITHER SINONASAL POLYPOSIS OR A PREOPERATIVE LUND-MACKAY SCORE OF =12. SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE EITHER TIVA OR INHALED ANESTHESIA (IA) DURING ESS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS INTRAOPERATIVE VISIBILITY AS RATED BY 3 BLINDED REVIEWERS UTILIZING THE 10-POINT WORMALD SURGICAL FIELD GRADING SCALE. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED OPERATIVE BLOOD LOSS, COMPLICATIONS, AND CHANGE IN QUALITY OF LIFE EVALUATED BY THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 72 PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TIVA (N = 37) AND IA (N = 35) STUDY ARMS. AGGREGATE MEDIAN (INTERQUARTILE RANGE) WORMALD SCORES ACROSS ALL REVIEWERS DEMONSTRATED A MORE FAVORABLE VISUAL FIELD WITH TIVA COMPARED TO IA (3.5 [2.4-3.9] VS IA 4.1[3.0-5.8], P = 0.0089). THERE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS BLOOD LOSS IN THE TIVA GROUP COMPARED TO THE IA GROUP (200 ML [100-450] VS 300 ML [200-500], P = 0.046). BASELINE PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS WERE COMPARABLE BETWEEN COHORTS WITH NO SIGNIFICANT POSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE DETECTED BETWEEN POSTOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORES AT 3 MONTHS (P = 0.278) AND AT 6 MONTHS (P = 0.396) FOLLOWING ESS.

METHODS: ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT CHRONIC SINUSITIS AND NASAL POLYPS RECEIVED ANTERIOR-TO-POSTERIOR-TO-ANTERIOR REVISION ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY. THIS SURGICAL TECHNIQUE HAS 5 IMPORTANT STEPS, INCLUDING EXPOSING THE CHOANA, ENLARGING THE MAXILLARY SINUS OSTIUM, OPENING THE SPHENOID SINUS AND POSTERIOR ETHMOID SINUS ANTERIORLY TO POSTERIORLY, RESECTING THE ETHMOID SINUS POSTERIORLY TO ANTERIORLY, AND OPENING THE FRONTAL SINUS POSTERIORLY TO ANTERIORLY. THE CHOANA, MAXILLARY SINUS OSTIUM, MIDDLE TURBINATE REMNANT, AND THE ROOF AND LATERAL WALL OF THE SPHENOID SINUS ARE 4 STABLE ANATOMIC REFERENCE POINTS. RESULTS: TWELVE MONTHS POSTOPERATIVELY, THE MEAN SNOT-22 SCORE HAD IMPROVED BY 18.48 AND 100 (88.50%) PATIENTS HAD AN IMPROVEMENT IN NASAL OBSTRUCTION; THICK NASAL DISCHARGE, LOSS OF SMELL OR TASTE, AND FACIAL PAIN/PRESSURE IMPROVEMENTS WERE NOTED IN 102 (90.27%), 64 (56.64%) AND 76 (67.26%) PATIENTS, RESPECTIVELY. POSTOPERATIVE ENDOSCOPIC EVALUATION AFTER 12 MONTHS INDICATED THAT 29 (25.66%), 12 (10.62%), 5 (4.42%), 6 (5.31%), AND 2 (1.77%) PATIENTS HAD MUCOSAL EDEMA, NASAL DISCHARGE, SYNECHIAE, POLYPS, AND CRUSTING, RESPECTIVELY. NO SEVERE COMPLICATIONS WERE OBSERVED. CONCLUSION: THE ANTERIOR-TO-POSTERIOR-TO-ANTERIOR TECHNIQUE IS AN EFFECTIVE AND SAFE APPROACH TO REVISION ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY. THE 4 STABLE ANATOMIC REFERENCE POINTS ARE HELPFUL FOR PREVENTING SEVERE COMPLICATIONS IN TOTAL ETHMOIDECTOMY.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, FIRST AFFILIATED HOSPITAL OF NANCHANG UNIVERSITY, NANCHANG, CHINA.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT 2009 S.

THIS STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE SEPTOPLASTY-RELATED CHANGES IN OLFACTORY FUNCTION AND THEIR EFFECT ON PATIENTS' QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). METHODS: PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF SIXTY PATIENTS WITH NASAL OBSTRUCTION AND SEPTAL DEVIATION AND 25 HEALTHY CONTROLS. OBJECTIVE MEASUREMENTS WERE PERFORMED FOR THE EVALUATION OF NASAL PATENCY AND \"SNIFFIN' STICKS\" TESTS WERE USED FOR QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF LATERALIZED AND BILATERAL OLFACTORY PERFORMANCE. ALL PARTICIPANTS SELF-ASSESSED THEIR SMELL USING A VISUAL ANALOG SCALE AND COMPLETED VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRES FOR NASAL OBSTRUCTION (NASAL OBSTRUCTION SYMPTOM EVALUATION: NOSE), FOR NASAL SYMPTOMS QOL (SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST-22: SNOT-22), FOR OLFACTION-ASSOCIATED QOL (QUESTIONNAIRE OF OLFACTORY DEFICITS: QOD) PREOPERATIVELY AND SIX MONTHS AFTER SEPTOPLASTY AND REPORTED PERSONAL BENEFIT AFTER SURGERY (GLASGOW BENEFIT INVENTORY: GBI), SIX MONTHS POSTOPERATIVELY. RESULTS: SMELL WAS SIGNIFICANTLY COMPROMISED DUE TO SEPTAL DEVIATION ESPECIALLY IN THE MORE OBSTRUCTED NASAL CAVITY SIDE. SMELL IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER SEPTOPLASTY (SUBJECTIVE REPORT AND OLFACTORY MEASUREMENTS), ALONG WITH INCREASED NASAL PATENCY. INCREASED NASAL CAVITY VOLUME WAS SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH OLFACTORY THRESHOLDS BUT NOT WITH SUPRATHRESHOLD MEASUREMENTS. SUBJECTIVE HYPOSMIA AND LATERALIZED OLFACTION WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED POSTOPERATIVELY. POSTOPERATIVELY, NORMOSMIC PATIENTS REPORTED HIGHER PERSONAL BENEFIT FROM SURGERY THAN PATIENTS WITH OLFACTORY DISORDERS. THE PATIENTS' QOL IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY, BUT IT REMAINED LOWER THAN THE CONTROLS' GROUP. OLFACTION-ASSOCIATED QOL WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN PATIENTS AND CONTROLS BEFORE AND AFTER SEPTOPLASTY. CONCLUSION: SEPTOPLASTY LEADS TO IMPROVEMENT IN SMELL PERCEPTION, AND PATIENTS WITH IMPROVED SMELL REPORT GREATER PERSONAL BENEFIT FROM SEPTOPLASTY THAN PATIENTS WITH REMAINING OLFACTORY DEFICITS.","1ST OTOLARYNGOLOGY DEPARTMENT, MEDICAL DEPT, SCHOOL OF HEALTH SCIENCES, ARISTOTLE UNIVERSITY OF THESSALONIKI, 54124 THESSALONIKI, GREECE.; 1ST OTOLARYNGOLOGY DEPARTMENT, MEDICAL DEPT, SCHOOL OF HEALTH SCIENCES, ARISTOTLE UNIVERSITY OF THESSALONIKI, 54124 THESSALONIKI, GREECE.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: NAN@MED.;AUTH.;GR.; OTOLARYNGOLOGY DEPARTMENT, GENERAL HOSPITAL GEORGIOS GENNIMATAS, ETHNIKIS AMYNIS 41, 54635 THESSALONIKI, GREECE.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: KOTITELI@OTENER.;GR.; 1ST OTOLARYNGOLOGY DEPARTMENT, MEDICAL DEPT, SCHOOL OF HEALTH SCIENCES, ARISTOTLE UNIVERSITY OF THESSALONIKI, 54124 THESSALONIKI, GREECE.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: JANCONST@OTENET.;GR.; 1ST OTOLARYNGOLOGY DEPARTMENT, MEDICAL DEPT, SCHOOL OF HEALTH SCIENCES, ARISTOTLE UNIVERSITY OF THESSALONIKI, 54124 THESSALONIKI, GREECE.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: TRIARIDIS@HOTMAIL.;COM.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT © 2019 ELSEVIER INC.

MOST SEPTOPLASTIES AIM TO IMPROVE DIURNAL AND NOCTURNAL NASAL OBSTRUCTION. THE EVIDENCE BASE FOR SEPTOPLASTY CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS IS HITHERTO VERY LIMITED. AIMS: TO ESTABLISH, AND INFORM GUIDANCE FOR, THE BEST MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH NASAL OBSTRUCTION ASSOCIATED WITH A DEVIATED SEPTUM. METHODS/DESIGN: A MULTICENTRE, MIXED-METHODS, OPEN LABEL, RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF SEPTOPLASTY VERSUS MEDICAL MANAGEMENT FOR ADULTS WITH A DEVIATED SEPTUM AND A REDUCED NASAL AIRWAY. ELIGIBLE PATIENTS WILL HAVE SEPTAL DEFLECTION VISIBLE AT NASENDOSCOPY AND A NASAL SYMPTOM SCORE = 30 ON THE NOSE QUESTIONNAIRE. SURGICAL TREATMENT COMPRISES SEPTOPLASTY WITH OR WITHOUT REDUCTION OF THE INFERIOR NASAL TURBINATE ON THE ANATOMICALLY WIDER SIDE OF THE NOSE. MEDICAL MANAGEMENT COMPRISES A NASAL SALINE SPRAY FOLLOWED BY A FLUORINATED STEROID SPRAY DAILY FOR SIX MONTHS. THE RECRUITMENT TARGET IS 378 PATIENTS, RECRUITED FROM UP TO 17 SITES ACROSS SCOTLAND, ENGLAND AND WALES. RANDOMISATION WILL BE ON A 1:1 BASIS, STRATIFIED BY GENDER AND SEVERITY (NOSE SCORE). PARTICIPANTS WILL BE FOLLOWED UP FOR 12 MONTHS POST RANDOMISATION. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE IS THE TOTAL SNOT-22 SCORE AT 6 MONTHS. CLINICAL AND ECONOMIC OUTCOMES WILL BE MODELLED AGAINST BASELINE SEVERITY (NOSE SCALE) TO INFORM CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING. THE STUDY INCLUDES A RECRUITMENT ENHANCEMENT PROCESS, AND AN ECONOMIC EVALUATION. DISCUSSION: THE NAIROS TRIAL WILL EVALUATE THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF SEPTOPLASTY VERSUS MEDICAL MANAGEMENT FOR ADULTS WITH A DEVIATED SEPTUM AND SYMPTOMS OF NASAL BLOCKAGE.

WE PRESENT A COMPARISON OF THE CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF PCMT WITH PARANASAL SINUS POLYPOSIS (PSP), A COMMON CONDITION WITH POTENTIALLY SIMILAR APPEARANCE. STUDY DESIGN PARALLEL CASE SERIES. SETTING TERTIARY RHINOLOGY CLINIC. SUBJECTS AND METHODS DATA WERE PROSPECTIVELY COMPILED FROM CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS DURING A 12-MONTH PERIOD WITH EITHER PSP ARISING FROM THE MIDDLE MEATUS OR PCMT LIMITED TO THE MIDDLE TURBINATE AS IDENTIFIED ON NASAL ENDOSCOPY. RECORDED DATA INCLUDED COMORBIDITIES, THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), NASAL OBSTRUCTION SYMPTOM EVALUATION (NOSE), LUND-MACKAY SCORE FROM COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) IMAGING, AND TOTAL EOSINOPHIL LEVELS. RESULTS OF 593 PATIENTS, 23 (3.9%) HAD PCMT AND 44 (7.4%) HAD PSP. THE PSP GROUP WAS PREDOMINANTLY MALE (75% VS 52%, P < .001) WITH AN OLDER MEAN AGE (53.4 VS 35.4 YEARS, P < .0001). PCMT WAS MORE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH ALLERGIC RHINITIS (83% VS 34%, P < .001), WHEREAS PCMT WAS RARELY ASSOCIATED WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (10% VS 100%, P < .0001). MEAN EOSINOPHIL COUNT (7.1 VS 3.1, P = .096) WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN GROUPS, WHEREAS MEAN LUND-MACKAY SCORE WAS HIGHER IN PSP (14.9 VS 2.8, P < .0008). MEAN NOSE SCORE WAS GREATER IN PSP (65.3 VS 46.8, P = .025), WHEREAS SNOT-22 SCORE WAS COMPARABLE BETWEEN GROUPS (40.6 VS 34.6, P = .29). CONCLUSION PCMT IS A UNIQUE PHYSICAL FINDING WITH CLINICAL ASSOCIATIONS THAT DISTINGUISH IT FROM PSP. PCMT HAS GREATER ASSOCIATION WITH ALLERGIC RHINITIS THAN CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS, AND BOTH PCMT AND PSP ARE ASSOCIATED WITH IMPAIRED QUALITY OF LIFE.","1 TULANE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA, USA.; 1 TULANE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA, USA.; 1 TULANE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA, USA.; 2 OCHSNER CLINIC FOUNDATION, DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA, USA.; 3 UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, OCHSNER CLINICAL SCHOOL, NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA, USA.;",NA,NA,"OTOLARYNGOL HEAD NECK SURG. 2018 JAN;158(1):199.

HOWEVER, IN CLINICAL RESEARCH PATIENTS CAN BE OVERWHELMED WITH MULTIPLE QUESTIONNAIRES. WE RECENTLY DEVELOPED THE 7-ITEM BRIEF QOD-NS (B-QOD). OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO EVALUATE THE PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES OF THE B-QOD IN BOTH THE DEVELOPMENT (D) SAMPLE, AND IN A SEPARATE REPLICATION (R) SAMPLE. METHODS: TESTING ON D (N = 203) AND R (N = 281) SAMPLES INCLUDED INITIAL EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS (EFA), FOLLOWED BY INTERNAL RELIABILITY, INFORMATION LOSS, AND CONFIRMATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS (CFA). FINALLY, INCREMENTAL PREDICTIVE UTILITY ANALYSIS (IPUA) WAS PERFORMED BY CORRELATING THE B-QOD WITH THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SURVEY. RESULTS: EFAS OF BOTH D AND R DEMONSTRATED AN UNDERLYING SINGLE-FACTOR STRUCTURE (EIGENVALUE = 4.17 AND 3.57, RESPECTIVELY) WITH COMPARABLE LOADING FACTORS (R > 0.30 FOR BOTH). B-QOD ALSO HAD GOOD INTERNAL RELIABILITY IN BOTH D AND R (CRONBACH'S ALPHA = 0.88 AND 0.83, RESPECTIVELY). ALSO, THERE IS MINIMAL INFORMATION LOSS WITH B-QOD COMPARED TO QOD-NS IN BOTH D AND R (R = 0.98 AND 0.96, RESPECTIVELY). CFA INDICATES THAT THE B-QOD SINGLE-FACTOR MODEL HAS GOOD OVERALL FIT AS MEASURED BY THE COMPARATIVE FIT INDEX (CFI) AND THE STANDARDIZED ROOT MEAN SQUARED RESIDUALS (SRMSR) IN THE D AND R SAMPLES (CFI = 0.99 AND 0.97; SRMSR = 0.035 AND 0.053). IPUA SHOWS THAT THE QOD-NS OFFERS NO ADDITIONAL PREDICTIVE BENEFIT OF SNOT-22 SCORES WHEN COMPARED WITH B-QOD. CONCLUSION: THE 7-ITEM B-QOD CAPTURES A STRUCTURALLY COHERENT AND RELIABLE SINGLE DIMENSION, WITH MINIMAL INFORMATION LOSS AND EXCELLENT EXTERNAL PREDICTIVE UTILITY WHEN COMPARED TO THE QOD-NS.","DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND SINUS SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY, PORTLAND STATE UNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OREGON, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, OREGON HEALTH AND SCIENCE UNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OREGON, USA.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND SINUS SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, RALPH H.; JOHNSON VETERANS AFFAIRS (VA) MEDICAL CENTER, CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO, DENVER, COLORADO, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO, DENVER, COLORADO, USA.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF UTAH, SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, USA.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND SINUS SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, OREGON HEALTH AND SCIENCE UNIVERSITY, PORTLAND, OREGON, USA.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY AND SINUS SURGERY, DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA, USA.;","ORCID: 0000-0001-8766-1626 ORCID: 0000-0001-8612-5442 ORCID: 0000-0001-9736-4561 ORCID: 0000-0002-6424-7083","© 2021 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,"POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: Z.M.S.: OLYMPUS, OPTINOSE, REGENERON, HEALTHY HUMMING, AND NOVARTIS, CONSULTANT (NOT AFFILIATED WITH THIS STUDY).

RESULTS: THE MEDIAN MLK-DISCHARGE SCORE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED IN ALL PATIENTS BY 1.50 POINTS POST-PVP-I RINSING (P VALUE < 0.01). THE TOTAL MLK SCORE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED IN ALL PATIENTS BY 1.50 POINTS (P VALUE = 0.01). UP TO A 17% REDUCTION IN SERUM INFLAMMATORY MARKERS WAS MEASURED POST-PVP-I RINSING. SINONASAL CULTURE REVEALED A SHIFT FROM MODERATE-HEAVY GROWTH TO LIGHTER BACTERIAL GROWTH OVERALL. SUBJECTIVE SNOT-22 SCORES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED OVERALL BY = 1 MINIMAL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE (MCID > 12; BASELINE MEDIAN = 33; FOLLOW-UP MEDIAN = 20; P VALUE < 0.01; N = 22). TSH LEVELS INCREASED NON-SIGNIFICANTLY WITHIN NORMAL RANGES (BASELINE MEDIAN = 1.59 MU/L; FOLLOW-UP MEDIAN = 1.92 MU/L; P = 0.10; N = 15). MUCOCILIARY CLEARANCE TIME INCREASED NON-SIGNIFICANTLY WITHIN NORMAL RANGES (BASELINE MEDIAN = 9 MIN; FOLLOW-UP MEDIAN = 10 MIN; P VALUE = 0.53; N = 17). OLFACTORY SNIFFIN'16 SCORES NON-SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED WITHIN AGE-RELATED NORMAL RANGES (BASELINE MEDIAN = 14; FOLLOW-UP MEDIAN = 13; P VALUE = 0.72; N = 18). CONCLUSION: A DILUTE 0.08% PVP-I SINONASAL RINSE AS AN ANCILLARY THERAPY IN RECALCITRANT CRS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES SIGNS OF INFECTION ALONGSIDE NOTABLE SYMPTOM IMPROVEMENT, WITHOUT AFFECTING THYROID FUNCTION, MUCOCILIARY CLEARANCE OR OLFACTION.","DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, ST.; PAUL'S SINUS CENTRE, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, ST.; PAUL'S SINUS CENTRE, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, ST.; PAUL'S SINUS CENTRE, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, ST.; PAUL'S SINUS CENTRE, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, ST.; PAUL'S SINUS CENTRE, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, ST.; PAUL'S SINUS CENTRE, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, ST.; PAUL'S SINUS CENTRE, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA.; SINUSDOC@ME.;COM.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019/09/28 06:00","20200218","20190927",2019,"2019/09/29 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"12",NA,"1434-4726 (ELECTRONIC) 0937-4477 (LINKING)","9002937","EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY : OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN FEDERATION OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGICAL SOCIETIES (EUFOS) : AFFILIATED WITH THE GERMAN SOCIETY FOR OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY","ENG","10.1007/S00405-019-05628-W [DOI]","20210110","2020/02/19 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","3373-3381","GERMANY",NA,NA,"31560120","PPUBLISH","0 (ANTI-INFECTIVE AGENTS, LOCAL) 85H0HZU99M (POVIDONE-IODINE)","IM",NA,"EUR ARCH OTORHINOLARYNGOL. 2019 DEC;276(12):3373-3381.

OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE THE ABILITY OF CLINICAL HISTORY AND BIOMARKERS TO DISTINGUISH THESE CONDITIONS. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 74 CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS UNDERGOING SURGERY FOR NP WERE ENROLLED. CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS WERE EVALUATED USING THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22). BIOMARKERS INCLUDED ABSOLUTE EOSINOPHIL COUNT, IGE, AND EXTENT OF TISSUE HYPERPLASIA ON SINUS COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SCAN. TISSUE EOSINOPHILIA WAS QUANTIFIED IN 10 RANDOM HPF AND DATA ANALYZED ADDRESSING BOTH PEAK AND AVERAGE RESULTS. RESULTS: NO COMPONENT OF THE SNOT-22 WAS PREDICTIVE OF TISSUE EOSINOPHILIA. SIMILARLY, A MEDICAL HISTORY OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS, ASTHMA, OR ASPIRIN-EXACERBATED RESPIRATORY DISEASE WAS NOT PREDICTIVE. AN ABSOLUTE EOSINOPHIL COUNT OF MORE THAN 300 WAS ASSOCIATED WITH NP TISSUE EOSINOPHILIA. IN CONTRAST, NEITHER IGE NOR EXTENT OF SINUS COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY HYPERPLASIA WAS PREDICTIVE. CONCLUSIONS: THE ABILITY TO INDIVIDUALIZE THERAPIES FOR NP IS DEPENDENT ON IDENTIFYING CLINICAL FEATURES OR BIOMARKERS OF EOSINOPHILIA.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO CHARACTERIZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ET INFLAMMATION AND ETD SYMPTOMS AND TO DETERMINE THE DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE OF A QUANTITATIVE SCORE. METHODS: PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED IN A RHINOLOGY CLINIC BETWEEN OCTOBER 2018 AND JUNE 2019. PATIENTS UNDERWENT NASAL ENDOSCOPY AND COMPLETED THE 7-ITEM EUSTACHIAN TUBE DYSFUNCTION QUESTIONNAIRE (ETDQ-7). NASOPHARYNGEAL INFLAMMATION IDENTIFIED ON ENDOSCOPY WAS QUANTIFIED USING THE ENDOSCOPIC EVALUATION OF THE EUSTACHIAN TUBE (3ET) SCORE. TYMPANOMETRY WAS PERFORMED AS INDICATED. COMORBID CONDITIONS WERE ASSIGNED DURING THE PATIENT ENCOUNTER. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 414 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. PATIENTS WITH CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT ETD SYMPTOMS (ETDQ-7 =2.1) HAD HIGHER 3ET SCORES THAN THOSE WITHOUT SYMPTOMS. A 1-POINT INCREASE IN 3ET SCORE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A 1.7-FOLD INCREASE IN ODDS OF CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT ETD SYMPTOMS (ADJUSTED OR [AOR], 1.72; 95% CI, 1.46 TO 2.05). THE 3ET SCORES WERE CORRELATED WITH ETDQ-7 SCORES (<U+03A1> = 0.54) AND 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORES (<U+03A1> = 0.52). 3ET SCORES WERE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH TYMPANOMETRIC PEAK PRESSURES. PATIENTS WITH ETD SYMPTOMS WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE LARYNGOPHARYNGEAL REFLUX (AOR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.24 TO 6.18). A 3ET SCORE OF 4 PREDICTED SYMPTOMATIC STATE IN 80% OF CASES WITH A SPECIFICITY OF 97.8% AND POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE OF 96.6%. CONCLUSION: INFLAMMATORY FINDINGS AT THE NASOPHARYNGEAL ET ORIFICE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT ETD SYMPTOMS.

STUDY DESIGN: SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF PROSPECTIVELY COLLECTED DATA. METHODS: PATIENTS ENROLLED IN A SINUS SURGERY OUTCOMES STUDY BETWEEN MAY 2011 AND MARCH 2013 WERE STRATIFIED INTO TWO GROUPS--THOSE WHO WERE OPERATED ON BY AN ATTENDING ALONE AND THOSE OPERATED ON BY AN ATTENDING WITH A TRAINEE PRESENT (RESIDENT, FELLOW, OR BOTH). PATIENTS COMPLETED QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) SURVEYS INCLUDING THE CHRONIC SINUSITIS SURVEY (CSS), 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), AND EUROQOL 5-DIMENSION SURVEY PREOPERATIVELY AND 1 YEAR POSTOPERATIVELY. OPERATIVE TIME, ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS (EBL), COMPLICATION RATES, AND SURVEY SCORES WERE COMPARED BETWEEN GROUPS. RESULTS: THE STUDY POPULATION CONSISTED OF 452 PATIENTS. THE ATTENDING ALONE (N = 119) AND TRAINEE (N = 333) GROUPS WERE STATISTICALLY COMPARABLE IN TERMS OF PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS, DISEASE SEVERITY, AND EXTENT OF SURGERY. MEAN OPERATIVE TIME WAS SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTER IN THE ATTENDING-ALONE GROUP (80.0 VS. 90.6 MINUTES, P < .01). MEAN EBL (105 ML ATTENDING VS. 117 ML TRAINEE, P = .39) AND COMPLICATION RATES (3.3% ATTENDING VS. 0.6% TRAINEE, P = .07) WERE SIMILAR BETWEEN GROUPS. OBSERVED CHANGES IN QOL MEASURES FOLLOWING ESS WERE COMPARABLE BETWEEN GROUPS, ALTHOUGH ABSOLUTE IMPROVEMENT IN THE SNOT-22 SCORES (19.0 ATTENDING VS. 24.5 TRAINEE, P = .05) DID SHOW A TREND TOWARD GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN THE TRAINEE GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: TRAINEE PARTICIPATION IN ESS IS ASSOCIATED WITH PROLONGATION IN SURGICAL TIME; HOWEVER, SUCH PARTICIPATION WAS NOT FOUND TO ADVERSELY AFFECT PATIENT SAFETY OR CLINICAL OUTCOMES.

ALTHOUGH RESPIRATORY REACTIONS FOLLOWING INGESTION OF ASA AND OTHER NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDS) ARE CONSIDERED A HALLMARK OF THE CONDITION, RESPIRATORY INFLAMMATION PERSISTS DESPITE PATIENTS' AVOIDANCE OF NSAIDS. TREATMENT OF THIS CONDITION REMAINS CHALLENGING AND INCLUDES BOTH MEDICAL AND SURGICAL OPTIONS. METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE CROSSOVER SINGLE-BLIND MULTICENTER STUDY INVOLVING 4 TERTIARY RHINOLOGY CARE CENTERS (N = 30) WAS CONDUCTED IN WHICH PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO START WITH EITHER 6 WEEKS OF A REGULAR DIET OR 6 WEEKS OF A LOW-SALICYLATE DIET AND THEN CROSSED-OVER FOR A TOTAL STUDY DURATION OF 12 WEEKS. PATIENTS WERE EVALUATED AT BASELINE, 6 WEEKS (AT CROSSOVER) AND 12 WEEKS USING SUBJECTIVE MEASURES (22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 [SNOT-22], NASAL SINUS SYMPTOM SCALE [NSSS], AND 7-ITEM ASTHMA CONTROL QUESTIONNAIRE [ACQ-7]) AND OBJECTIVE OUTCOME INSTRUMENTS (PERIOPERATIVE SINUS EVALUATION [POSE] AND LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPIC SCORE [LKES]). RESULTS: DATA WAS ANALYZED FOR 30 PATIENTS. WILCOXON RANK SUM TESTS DETERMINED THAT PATIENTS HAD IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR MEDIAN DIFFERENCE IN SCORES, WHICH WERE ALL STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, WHEN THEY FOLLOWED THE LOW-SALICYLATE DIET COMPARED TO THEIR REGULAR DIET: SNOT-22: 15 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], 10 TO 23.25), P < 0.001; NSSS: 3 (95% CI, 1.75 TO 4), P < 0.001; ACQ-7: 4.5 (95% CI, 1.5 TO 8.5), P < 0.001; POSE 6 (95% CI, 2.5 TO 10), P < 0.001; AND LKES: 2.5 (95% CI, 1.5 TO 4), P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: THE LOW-SALICYLATE DIET MAY OFFER A NOVEL TREATMENT ADJUNCT TO THE CURRENT MANAGEMENT OF AERD.

NECK PAIN HAS RECEIVED EXTENSIVE ATTENTION IN MIGRAINE, TENSION-TYPE AND CERVICOGENIC HEADACHE BUT NOT AS A COMORBID FEATURE OF HEADACHE IN THOSE WITH RHINOSINUSITIS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE OCCURRENCE OF NECK PAIN AND CERVICAL MUSCULOSKELETAL DYSFUNCTION IN INDIVIDUALS WITH SELF-REPORTED SINUS HEADACHES (SRSH). METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WITH AND WITHOUT SRSH ATTENDED A SINGLE DATA COLLECTION SESSION. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE HEADACHE IMPACT TEST (HIT)-6 AND THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT)-22. CERVICAL RANGE OF MOTION (ROM), SEGMENTAL EXAMINATION, MUSCLE ENDURANCE AND PRESSURE-PAIN THRESHOLD (PPT) WERE MEASURED . RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED 31 WITH SRSH (77.4% FEMALE; AGE 43.7 (9.9) YEARS) AND 30 WITHOUT HEADACHE. AVERAGE SYMPTOM DURATION WAS 89.7 (±85.6) MONTHS. MEAN SNOT-22 AND HIT-6 SCORES WERE 36.2 (15.3) AND 56.7 (7.1), RESPECTIVELY. IN THE SRSH GROUP, 83.9% (N = 26) REPORTED NECK PAIN.

OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY COMPARES PATIENT SATISFACTION SCORES BETWEEN IN-PERSON CLINIC VISITS AND TELEMEDICINE VIDEO VISITS IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS). METHODS: SIXTY-NINE PATIENTS WITH CRS PRESENTING TO AN ACADEMIC RHINOLOGY CLINIC BETWEEN MARCH TO APRIL 2020 WERE RETROSPECTIVELY DIVIDED INTO VIDEO VISITS (VV) AND CLINIC VISITS (CV) GROUPS BASED ON MANDATED STATE QUARANTINE ORDERS ON MARCH 19. PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS, DISEASE SEVERITY MEASURES, AND PATIENT SATISFACTION QUESTIONNAIRE-18 (PSQ-18) SCORES WERE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED. CHI SQUARE TEST AND FISHER'S EXACT TEST WERE PERFORMED. RESULTS: THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN AGE (P = 0.81), GENDER (P = 0.55), CRS PHENOTYPE (P = 0.16), AND DISEASE SEVERITY MEASURES (SINONASAL OUTCOMES TEST-22 (SNOT-22) (P = 0.92); LUND-MACKAY SCORE (P = 0.96)) BETWEEN THE VIDEO AND CLINIC VISIT GROUPS.

HOWEVER, SURGEONS HAVE NOT ADOPTED UNTIL NOW ANY SYSTEMATIC OUTCOME INSTRUMENT. THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) IS A VALIDATED SINONASAL OUTCOME SCORE IN SINONASAL AND SEPTORHINOPLASTY SURGERY BUT DOES NOT MEASURE AESTHETIC OUTCOME. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO VALIDATE A MODIFICATION TO THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOMES TEST-22 (SNOT-22) WITH A NEW QUESTION REGARDING THE SHAPE OF THE NOSE (SNOT-23). METHODOLOGY: WE CONDUCTED A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY ON 69 CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS UNDERGOING SEPTORHINOPLASTY AND A CONTROL GROUP OF HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS. REPRODUCIBILITY, RESPONSIVENESS TO TREATMENT, KNOWN GROUP DIFFERENCES AND VALIDITY OF THE SNOT-23 WERE ANALYSED. SCORES WERE COMPARED TO VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALES, NASAL OBSTRUCTION SYMPTOMS EVALUATION (NOSE) SCORE AND NASAL INSPIRATORY PEAK FLOW. RESULTS: SNOT-23 HAS GOOD TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY AND IS A VALID OUTCOME MEASURE FOR ASSESSING RESPONSE TO SURGERY ESPECIALLY WITH REGARDS TO SHAPE OF THE NOSE AND NASAL OBSTRUCTION WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER PATIENT REPORTED MEASURES. CONCLUSION: SNOT-23 IS A VALID AND RELIABLE TOOL THAT CAN BE EASILY USED IN ROUTINE CLINICAL PRACTICE TO ASSESS THE FUNCTIONAL AND AESTHETIC OUTCOMES FROM SEPTORHINOPLASTY SURGERY. THE SNOT-23 COULD BE ADOPTED AS A UNIVERSAL, EASY TO USE TOOL IN RHINOLOGY CLINICS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF RESPONSE TO SEPTORHINOPLASTY AND SINUS SURGERY.","DEPARTMENT OF FACIAL PLASTICS AND RHINOLOGY, THE ROYAL NATIONAL THROAT, NOSE AND EAR HOSPITAL, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM.; DEPARTMENT OF FACIAL PLASTICS AND RHINOLOGY, THE ROYAL NATIONAL THROAT, NOSE AND EAR HOSPITAL, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM.; DEPARTMENT OF FACIAL PLASTICS AND RHINOLOGY, THE ROYAL NATIONAL THROAT, NOSE AND EAR HOSPITAL, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM.; DEPARTMENT OF FACIAL PLASTICS AND RHINOLOGY, THE ROYAL NATIONAL THROAT, NOSE AND EAR HOSPITAL, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM.; DEPARTMENT OF FACIAL PLASTICS AND RHINOLOGY, THE ROYAL NATIONAL THROAT, NOSE AND EAR HOSPITAL, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2014/12/06 06:00","20170703",NA,2014,"2014/12/06 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"4",NA,"0300-0729 (PRINT) 0300-0729 (LINKING)","0347242","RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.4193/RHINO14.009 [DOI]","20210608","2017/07/04 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","301-304","NETHERLANDS",NA,NA,"25479209","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"RHINOLOGY. 2014 DEC;52(4):301-304.

THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY ARE TO ASSESS THE QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OF INDIVIDUALS WITH CRS AND TO ANALYZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC AS WELL AS CLINICAL FACTORS AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS. METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL AND PREVALENCE-BASED STUDY WAS CONDUCTED FROM MAY TO JULY, 2018. WE USED THE SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22) QUESTIONNAIRE TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS. IN ADDITION, THE UNIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS WERE USED TO CALCULATE THE CRUDE ODDS RATIO (OR), ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO (AOR), AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CIS) FOR FACTORS. STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE WAS CONSIDERED AS P-VALUE <0.05. RESULTS: AMONG 315 PARTICIPANTS, ABOUT TWO FIFTHS OF THEM WERE DIAGNOSED WITH CRS. THE STATISTICAL TEST ILLUSTRATED THAT ALL FACTORS ILLUSTRATED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES. THE MAIN EXPOSURE VARIABLE, CRS, WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH POOR QUALITY OF LIFE, WITH A 78.02-FOLD INCREASE IN THE ODDS OF HAVING A GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE SCORE. CONCLUSIONS: OUR FINDINGS HAVE SHOWN THAT PATIENTS WITH CRS EXPERIENCE A POORER QUALITY OF LIFE THAN HEALTHY CONTROLS.

OSTEITIC BONE IS EVIDENT ON COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) AS HYPEROSTOSIS. WE PROPOSE TREATMENT OF THIS ENTITY WITH A SIX WEEK COURSE OF OUTPATIENT INTRAVENOUS ANTIBIOTICS IN AN APPROACH SIMILAR TO THAT USED IN THE ORTHOPEDIC LITERATURE FOR LONG BONE OSTEOMYELITIS. THIS GROUP OF PATIENTS CAN BE IDENTIFIED BASED ON SYMPTOMS, UNREMITTING COURSE OF DISEASE, AND IMAGING CRITERIA. ALTHOUGH INDICATIONS FOR THE USE OF OUTPATIENT INTRAVENOUS ANTIBIOTICS MUST BE DETERMINED JUDICIOUSLY IN CRS WE BELIEVE THAT HYPEROSTOTIC SINUSITIS IS AN ADDITIONAL INDICATION. STUDY DESIGN: A RETROSPECTIVE CHART REVIEW. METHODS: A RETROSPECTIVE CHART REVIEW OF TEN PATIENT WITH HYPEROSTOTIC SINUSITIS TREATED OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD (1/2007- 8/2009). RESULTS: TEN PATIENTS (AGE RANGE, 25-85) WITH HYPEROSTOTIC SINUSITIS WERE IDENTIFIED AND QUALITY OF LIFE WAS EVALUATED WITH SNOT-22. ALL PATIENTS UNDERWENT BOTH PRE- AND POST- TREATMENT NASAL ENDOSCOPY AND CT. ALL PATIENTS UNDERWENT REVISION SURGERY BY SENIOR AUTHOR (VKA). FIVE PATIENTS WERE TREATED WITH 6 WEEKS OF INTRAVENOUS ANTIBIOTICS. ANTIBIOTIC CHOICES WERE CULTURE DIRECTED AND ANTIBIOTICS ADMINISTERED INCLUDED CEFAZOLIN, CLINDAMYCIN, ERTAPENEM, MAXIPIME, AND VANCOMYCIN. MINOR COMPLICATIONS ENCOUNTERED DURING THERAPY INCLUDED: PARESTHESIAS AND ELEVATED LIVER ENZYMES. FIVE PATIENTS, (SERVING AS THE CONTROL GROUP), WERE TREATED WITH TRADITIONAL THERAPY INVOLVING INTERMITTENT AND PROLONGED COURSES OF ORAL ANTIBIOTICS. CONCLUSIONS: PROLONGED INTRAVENOUS ANTIBIOTICS MAY ACHIEVE ADEQUATE SERUM LEVELS THAT CANNOT BE ACHIEVED WITH ORAL ANTIBIOTICS. SYMPTOMATIC RELIEF IN PATIENTS WITH HYPEROSTOTIC SINUSITIS APPEARS SUPERIOR WITH INTRAVENOUS ANTIBIOTICS VERSUS TRADITIONAL ORAL THERAPY.

DESIGN: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY MEASURING UPNIF AND UMCA IN CONTROLS DEMONSTRATING NORMAL NASAL FUNCTION AND IN PATIENTS WITH NASAL OBSTRUCTION. SETTING: ROYAL NATIONAL THROAT NOSE AND EAR HOSPITAL, LONDON. PARTICIPANTS: A TOTAL OF 39 PARTICIPANTS, 26 CONTROLS AND 13 PATIENTS, WERE RECRUITED. CONTROLS EXHIBITED NORMAL NASAL FUNCTION WITH SNOT-22 <5. PATIENTS NASAL OBSTRUCTION SYMPTOMS SECONDARY TO INFLAMMATION OR STRUCTURAL ABNORMALITY WITH SNOT-22 >9. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: AIRFLOW RATES AND RESISTANCE VALUES WERE DERIVED FROM UPNIF AND UMCA MEASUREMENTS RESPECTIVELY BASED ON POISEUILLE'S LAWS. RATIOS BETWEEN RIGHT AND LEFT UPNIF AND UMCA VALUES WERE TAKEN TO ADJUST FOR CONFOUNDING FACTORS. THE RELATIONSHIP OF 1/RESISTANCE RATIO AND AIRFLOW RATE RATIO DEMONSTRATED A LINEAR OF DIRECT PROPORTIONALITY OF STRONG CORRELATION AND STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE (CORRELATION COEFFICIENT = 0.76, P « 0.01). THIS SUGGESTS THAT DATA POINTS FROM CONTROLS WITH A NORMAL NASAL CYCLE LIE CLOSELY ALONG THE REGRESSED LINE, WHILST THOSE LYING SIGNIFICANTLY AWAY WERE SHOWN TO BELONG TO PATIENTS WITH NASAL DYSFUNCTION. OLFACTORY DYSFUNCTION APPEARS TO BE A SENSITIVE DISCRIMINATOR IN PREDICTING THIS. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THE DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL RELATIONSHIP OF 1/RESISTANCE RATIO AND AIRFLOW RATE RATIO IN NORMAL NASAL FUNCTION.

THE CONDITION CAN OCCUR WITH OR WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS. SYSTEMIC AND TOPICAL ANTIBIOTICS ARE USED WITH THE AIM OF ELIMINATING INFECTION IN THE SHORT TERM (AND SOME TO REDUCE INFLAMMATION IN THE LONG TERM), IN ORDER TO NORMALISE NASAL MUCUS AND IMPROVE SYMPTOMS. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF SYSTEMIC AND TOPICAL ANTIBIOTICS IN PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS. SEARCH METHODS: THE COCHRANE ENT INFORMATION SPECIALIST SEARCHED THE COCHRANE ENT TRIALS REGISTER; CENTRAL (2015, ISSUE 8); MEDLINE; EMBASE; CLINICALTRIALS.GOV; ICTRP AND ADDITIONAL SOURCES FOR PUBLISHED AND UNPUBLISHED TRIALS. THE DATE OF THE SEARCH WAS 29 SEPTEMBER 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA: RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) WITH A FOLLOW-UP PERIOD OF AT LEAST THREE MONTHS COMPARING SYSTEMIC OR TOPICAL ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT TO (A) PLACEBO OR (B) NO TREATMENT OR (C) OTHER PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: WE USED THE STANDARD METHODOLOGICAL PROCEDURES EXPECTED BY COCHRANE. OUR PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE DISEASE-SPECIFIC HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQL), PATIENT-REPORTED DISEASE SEVERITY AND THE COMMONEST ADVERSE EVENT - GASTROINTESTINAL DISTURBANCE. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED GENERAL HRQL, ENDOSCOPIC NASAL POLYP SCORE, COMPUTERISED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) SCAN SCORE AND THE ADVERSE EVENTS OF SUSPECTED ALLERGIC REACTION (RASH OR SKIN IRRITATION) AND ANAPHYLAXIS OR OTHER VERY SERIOUS REACTIONS. WE USED GRADE TO ASSESS THE QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE FOR EACH OUTCOME; THIS IS INDICATED IN ITALICS. MAIN RESULTS: WE INCLUDED FIVE RCTS (293 PARTICIPANTS), ALL OF WHICH COMPARED SYSTEMIC ANTIBIOTICS WITH PLACEBO OR ANOTHER PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION.THE VARYING STUDY CHARACTERISTICS MADE COMPARISON DIFFICULT. FOUR STUDIES RECRUITED ONLY ADULTS AND ONE ONLY CHILDREN. THREE USED MACROLIDE, ONE TETRACYCLINE AND ONE A CEPHALOSPORIN-TYPE ANTIBIOTIC. THREE RECRUITED ONLY PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS, ONE RECRUITED PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITH NASAL POLYPS AND ONE HAD A MIXED POPULATION. THREE FOLLOWED UP PATIENTS FOR 10 TO 12 WEEKS AFTER TREATMENT HAD FINISHED. SYSTEMIC ANTIBIOTICS VERSUS PLACEBO THREE STUDIES COMPARED ANTIBIOTICS WITH PLACEBO (176 PARTICIPANTS).ONE STUDY (64 PARTICIPANTS, WITHOUT POLYPS) REPORTED DISEASE-SPECIFIC HRQL USING THE SNOT-20 (0 TO 5, 0 = BEST QUALITY OF LIFE). AT THE END OF TREATMENT (THREE MONTHS) THE SNOT-20 SCORE WAS LOWER IN THE GROUP RECEIVING MACROLIDE ANTIBIOTICS THAN THE PLACEBO GROUP (MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) -0.54 POINTS, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) -0.98 TO -0.10), CORRESPONDING TO A MODERATE EFFECT SIZE FAVOURING ANTIBIOTICS (MODERATE QUALITY EVIDENCE). THREE MONTHS AFTER TREATMENT, IT IS UNCERTAIN IF THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS.ONE STUDY (33 PARTICIPANTS, WITH POLYPS) PROVIDED INFORMATION ON GASTROINTESTINAL DISTURBANCES AND SUSPECTED ALLERGIC REACTION (RASH OR SKIN IRRITATION) AFTER A SHORT COURSE OF TETRACYCLINE ANTIBIOTIC COMPARED WITH PLACEBO. WE ARE VERY UNCERTAIN IF ANTIBIOTICS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN GASTROINTESTINAL DISTURBANCES (RISK RATIO (RR) 1.36, 95% CI 0.22 TO 8.50) OR SKIN IRRITATION (RR 6.67, 95% CI 0.34 TO 128.86) (VERY LOW QUALITY EVIDENCE). SYSTEMIC ANTIBIOTICS PLUS SALINE IRRIGATION AND INTRANASAL CORTICOSTEROIDS VERSUS PLACEBO PLUS SALINE IRRIGATION AND INTRANASAL CORTICOSTEROIDS ONE STUDY (60 PARTICIPANTS, SOME WITH AND SOME WITHOUT POLYPS) COMPARED A THREE-MONTH COURSE OF MACROLIDE ANTIBIOTIC WITH PLACEBO; ALL PARTICIPANTS ALSO USED SALINE IRRIGATION AND 70% USED INTRANASAL CORTICOSTEROIDS. DISEASE-SPECIFIC HRQL WAS REPORTED USING SNOT-22 (0 TO 110, 0 = BEST QUALITY OF LIFE). DATA WERE DIFFICULT TO INTERPRET (HIGHLY SKEWED AND BASELINE IMBALANCES) AND IT IS UNCLEAR IF THERE WAS AN IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE AT ANY TIME POINT (LOW QUALITY EVIDENCE). TO ASSESS PATIENT-REPORTED DISEASE SEVERITY PARTICIPANTS RATED THE EFFECT OF TREATMENT ON A FIVE-POINT SCALE (-2 FOR \"DESPERATELY WORSE\" TO 2 FOR \"CURED\") AT THE END OF TREATMENT (THREE MONTHS). FOR IMPROVEMENT IN SYMPTOMS THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ANTIBIOTICS AND PLACEBO GROUPS; THE RR WAS 1.50 (95% CI 0.81 TO 2.79; VERY LOW QUALITY EVIDENCE), ALTHOUGH THERE WERE ALSO SLIGHTLY MORE PEOPLE WHO FELT WORSE AFTER TREATMENT IN THE ANTIBIOTICS GROUP. THERE WAS NO DEMONSTRABLE DIFFERENCE IN THE RATE OF GASTROINTESTINAL DISTURBANCES BETWEEN THE GROUPS (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.16 TO 7.10). GENERAL HRQL WAS MEASURED USING THE SF-36. THE AUTHORS STATED THAT THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS AT THE END OF TREATMENT (12 WEEKS) OR TWO WEEKS LATER. SYSTEMIC ANTIBIOTICS VERSUS INTRANASAL CORTICOSTEROIDS ONE STUDY (43 PARTICIPANTS, WITHOUT POLYPS) COMPARED A THREE-MONTH COURSE OF MACROLIDE ANTIBIOTIC WITH INTRANASAL CORTICOSTEROIDS. PATIENT-REPORTED DISEASE SEVERITY WAS ASSESSED USING A COMPOSITE SYMPTOM SCORE (0 TO 40; 0 = NO SYMPTOMS). IT IS VERY UNCERTAIN IF THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE AS PATIENT-REPORTED DISEASE SEVERITY WAS SIMILAR BETWEEN GROUPS (MD -0.32, 95% CI -2.11 TO 1.47; LOW QUALITY EVIDENCE). SYSTEMIC ANTIBIOTICS VERSUS ORAL CORTICOSTEROIDS ONE STUDY (28 PARTICIPANTS, WITH POLYPS) COMPARED A SHORT COURSE OF TETRACYCLINE ANTIBIOTIC (UNCLEAR DURATION, ˜20 DAYS) WITH A 20-DAY COURSE OF ORAL CORTICOSTEROIDS. WE WERE UNABLE TO EXTRACT DATA ON ANY OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY OUTCOMES. IT IS UNCERTAIN IF THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE INGASTROINTESTINAL DISTURBANCES (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.16 TO 6.14) OR SKIN IRRITATION (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.20 TO 19.62) AS THE RESULTS FOR THESE OUTCOMES WERE SIMILAR BETWEEN GROUPS (VERY LOW QUALITY EVIDENCE). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: WE FOUND VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT SYSTEMIC ANTIBIOTICS ARE EFFECTIVE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS. WE DID FIND MODERATE QUALITY EVIDENCE OF A MODEST IMPROVEMENT IN DISEASE-SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE IN ADULTS WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITHOUT POLYPS RECEIVING THREE MONTHS OF A MACROLIDE ANTIBIOTIC. THE SIZE OF IMPROVEMENT WAS MODERATE (0.5 POINTS ON A FIVE-POINT SCALE) AND ONLY SEEN AT THE END OF THE THREE-MONTH TREATMENT; BY THREE MONTHS LATER NO DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND.DESPITE A GENERAL UNDERSTANDING THAT ANTIBIOTICS CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH ADVERSE EFFECTS, INCLUDING GASTROINTESTINAL DISTURBANCES, THE RESULTS IN THIS REVIEW WERE VERY UNCERTAIN BECAUSE THE STUDIES WERE SMALL AND FEW EVENTS WERE REPORTED.NO RCTS OF TOPICAL ANTIBIOTICS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA.MORE RESEARCH IN THIS AREA, PARTICULARLY EVALUATING LONGER-TERM OUTCOMES AND ADVERSE EFFECTS, IS REQUIRED.","UK COCHRANE CENTRE, SUMMERTOWN PAVILION, 18 - 24 MIDDLE WAY, OXFORD, UK.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,"LEE YEE CHONG: NONE KNOWN.

METHODS: A RETROSPECTIVE CHART REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED FOR PATIENTS WITH ASPIRIN CHALLENGE-PROVEN AERD WHO UNDERWENT COMPLETE ESS FOLLOWED BY ASPIRIN DESENSITIZATION. OUTCOMES ASSESSED INCLUDED NEED FOR REVISION SURGERY AND QUALITY-OF-LIFE MEASURES USING THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOMES TEST (SNOT-22). DATA WERE COLLECTED PREOPERATIVELY, POSTOPERATIVELY PRIOR TO DESENSITIZATION, AND THEN AT INTERVALS POST-DESENSITIZATION THROUGH 30 MONTHS AFTER ASPIRIN DESENSITIZATION. A LONGITUDINAL LINEAR MIXED-EFFECTS MODEL WAS USED FOR DATA ANALYSIS. RESULTS: THIRTY-FOUR PATIENTS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR THIS STUDY. THIRTY-TWO PATIENTS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED ASPIRIN DESENSITIZATION AND WERE SUBSEQUENTLY FOLLOWED FOR 30 MONTHS AFTER DESENSITIZATION. TWO PATIENTS WERE UNABLE TO COMPLETE DESENSITIZATION. FIVE PATIENTS DISCONTINUED ASPIRIN MAINTENANCE THERAPY DUE TO GASTROINTESTINAL AND RESPIRATORY SIDE EFFECTS. WITHIN THE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD, THERE WERE ONLY 3 (9.4%) REVISION SINUS SURGERIES. NOTABLY, 1 OF THESE REVISION CASES OCCURRED IN A PATIENT WHO HAD DISCONTINUED ASPIRIN MAINTENANCE THERAPY. AFTER SURGICAL TREATMENT AND PRIOR TO DESENSITIZATION PATIENTS HAD SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN SNOT-22 SCORES. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT TOTAL SNOT-22 SCORES REMAINED STATISTICALLY UNCHANGED FROM IMMEDIATE POST-DESENSITIZATION THROUGHOUT THE 30-MONTH FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. CONCLUSION: COMPLETE SINUS SURGERY FOLLOWED BY TIMELY ASPIRIN DESENSITIZATION AND MAINTENANCE THERAPY IS AN EFFECTIVE COMBINATION IN THE LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT OF SINUS DISEASE IN PATIENTS WITH AERD.","DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY, DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, PERELMAN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, PHILADELPHIA, PA.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY, DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, PERELMAN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, PHILADELPHIA, PA.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY, DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, PERELMAN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, PHILADELPHIA, PA.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY, DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, PERELMAN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, PHILADELPHIA, PA.; NORTH SHORE ENT, DANVERS, MA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA, TAMPA, FL.; LEONARD DAVIS INSTITUTE OF HEALTH ECONOMICS, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, PHILADELPHIA, PA.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY, DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, PERELMAN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, PHILADELPHIA, PA.; DIVISION OF RHINOLOGY, DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, PERELMAN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, PHILADELPHIA, PA.;",NA,"© 2017 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2017/11/07 06:00","20181211","20171103",2018,"2017/11/07 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"1",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.22036 [DOI]","20181211","2018/12/12 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","49-53","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"29105347","PPUBLISH","0 (ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENTS, NON-STEROIDAL) R16CO5Y76E (ASPIRIN)","IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2018 JAN;8(1):49-53.

THE PRESENT STUDY EVALUATED THE EFFECT OF THE INTRANASAL ADMINISTRATION OF HYALURONIC ACID IN A GROUP OF PATIENTS AFFECTED BY CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITHOUT NASAL POLYPS (CRSSNP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIRTY SUBJECTS AGED 18-65 YEARS AFFECTED BY CRSSNP WERE ENROLLED. THE SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMLY ADMINISTERED HYALURONIC ACID OR ISOTONIC SALINE SOLUTION BY NASAL NEBULIZER TWICE PER DAY FOR 30 DAYS. THEY WERE EVALUATED BEFORE (T0) AND AFTER THE TREATMENT (T1) WITH SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22, VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE FOR RHINORRHEA, NASAL OBSTRUCTION, FACIAL PAIN AND HYPOSMIA/HYPOGEUSIA, NASAL ENDOSCOPY, ACTIVE ANTERIOR RHINOMANOMETRY, PEAK NASAL INSPIRATORY FLOW AND NASAL CYTOLOGY. RESULTS: COMPARING THE STUDY AND THE CONTROL GROUP, AT T1 NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN BOTH OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE PARAMETERS. BEING INCLUDED IN THE STUDY GROUP RATHER THAN IN THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE VARIATION OF THE CONSIDERED PARAMETERS BETWEEN T0 AND T1. CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF THE MICRONIZED DOUCHES INDEPENDENTLY FROM THE TYPE OF SOLUTION USED (EITHER HYALURONIC ACID OR ISOTONIC SALINE SOLUTION), ALTHOUGH NO DIFFERENCE EMERGED BETWEEN STUDY AND CONTROL GROUP FOR ANY OF THE OBJECTIVE PARAMETERS, THERE WAS AN IMPROVEMENT OF SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 SCORES (P = .0005), VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE FOR NASAL OBSTRUCTION (P = .0006) AND FOR HYPOSMIA/HYPOGEUSIA (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: THE TREATMENT WITH MICRONIZED NASAL DOUCHES CAN IMPROVE THE SINO-NASAL SYMPTOMS OF CRSSNP, IN PARTICULAR NASAL OBSTRUCTION AND OLFACTORY ABILITY.

THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO VALIDATE UNILATERAL ENDOSCOPIC RESECTION WITH TRANSNASAL CRANIECTOMY (UERTC) IN SELECTED ITACS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PATIENTS AFFECTED BY ITAC RECEIVING UERTC FROM 2004 TO 2017 AT TWO TERTIARY REFERRAL CENTERS WERE RETROSPECTIVELY ANALYZED. A CONTROL GROUP OF PATIENTS TREATED WITH BILATERAL ENDOSCOPIC RESECTION WITH TRANSNASAL CRANIECTOMY (BERTC) WAS SELECTED. OLFACTION, TASTE, AND QUALITY OF LIFE WERE EVALUATED. SURVIVAL AND FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES IN THE TWO GROUPS WERE COMPARED. RESULTS: FIFTY-FOUR PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT UERTC (CASE GROUP: 27/54) OR BERTC (CONTROL GROUP: 27/54) WERE ENROLLED. THE TWO GROUPS WERE STATISTICALLY COMPARABLE. FIVE-YEAR OVERALL (OS), DISEASE-SPECIFIC (DSS), RECURRENCE-FREE (RFS) SURVIVALS, AND LOCAL RECURRENCE RATES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN GROUPS. HOSPITALIZATION TIME WAS SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTER IN THE UERTC GROUP (P = 0.0004) AND NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF COMPLICATIONS WAS DEMONSTRATED. THE RATE OF SUBJECTIVE OLFACTION PRESERVATION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE UERTC GROUP (45.5%) THAN IN THE BERTC GROUP (0.0%) (P = 0.0007). MEDIAN 22-ITEMS SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) VALUES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN GROUPS. NO SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION OF OLFACTION AND TASTE PRESERVATION/WORSENING WITH RECONSTRUCTIVE TECHNIQUE, RADIATION THERAPY, AND CHEMOTHERAPY WAS OBSERVED. CONCLUSIONS: UERTC IS AN ADEQUATE SURGICAL PROCEDURE FOR SELECTED UNILATERAL ITAC WITH SIMILAR SURVIVAL RATES AND LOWER MORBIDITY COMPARED TO BERTC.

IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY A WIDE SPECTRUM OF EXTRAPULMONARY SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING SINONASAL AND PARANASAL SINUS ABNORMALITIES. THESE ARE THE MOST COMMON FEATURES OF THIS DISEASE, CONSTITUTING DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR EGPA. HOWEVER, THE ACTUAL CLINICAL FEATURES, CELLULAR MECHANISMS AND IMPACT ON PATIENTS' QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) ARE STILL A MATTER OF STUDY. METHODS: THIRTY-NINE EGPA PATIENTS UNDERWENT MULTIDIMENSIONAL RHINOLOGICAL EVALUATIONS, INCLUDING RHINOFIBROSCOPY, NASAL CYTOLOGY, AND QOL QUESTIONNAIRES. THIS WAS COUPLED WITH RESPIRATORY AND RHEUMATOLOGICAL ASSESSMENTS. RESULTS: TWENTY-EIGHT PATIENTS WERE DIAGNOSED WITH CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS). OF THESE, 18 HAD NASAL POLYPOSIS (NP). CHRONIC RHINITIS WAS DIAGNOSED IN 10 PATIENTS. OF THESE, 3 HAD ALLERGIC RHINITIS (AR) AND SEVEN HAD NON-AR (NAR). OVERALL, ONLY 1 PATIENT (2.6%) WAS NORMAL. NASAL CYTOLOGY SHOWED THAT HYPEREOSINOPHILIA WAS PRESENT IN 17/28 PATIENTS WITH CRS, 4/7 PATIENTS WITH NAR AND ALL PATIENTS WITH AR. SNOT-22 AND SF-36 SHOWED A SEVERE IMPACT OF NASAL SYMPTOMS ON QOL. NO DIFFERENCES IN ASTHMA CONTROL OR RHEUMATOLOGICAL PATTERNS FOR EGPA WERE OBSERVED AMONG PATIENTS WITH OR WITHOUT NP. CONCLUSIONS: EVEN WHEN THE RHEUMATOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT SCORED EGPA \"UNDER CONTROL\" ACCORDING TO THE BIRMINGHAM VASCULITIS ACTIVITY SCORE AND VASCULITIS DAMAGE INDEX, SINONASAL DISEASES AND RELATED NASAL INFLAMMATORY PROCESSES WERE NOT CONTROLLED. THEREFORE, THERE IS A NEED FOR CLINICAL MONITORING AND TARGETED TREATMENT TO CONTROL THE INFLAMMATORY PROCESSES AND IMPROVE THE QOL OF EGPA PATIENTS.","1ST OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY UNIT, DEPARTMENT OF NEUROSCIENCE, AZIENDA OSPEDALIERO-UNIVERSITARIA PISANA, PISA, ITALY.; RHEUMATOLOGY UNIT, UNIVERSITY OF PISA, PISA, ITALY.; RESPIRATORY PATHOPHYSIOLOGY UNIT, CARDIOTHORACIC AND VASCULAR DEPARTMENT, AZIENDA OSPEDALIERO-UNIVERSITARIA PISANA, PISA, ITALY.; SECTION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, DEPARTMENT OF BASIC MEDICAL SCIENCE, NEUROSCIENCE AND SENSORY ORGANS, UNIVERSITY OF BARI, BARI, ITALY.; 1ST OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY UNIT, DEPARTMENT OF NEUROSCIENCE, AZIENDA OSPEDALIERO-UNIVERSITARIA PISANA, PISA, ITALY.; 1ST OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY UNIT, DEPARTMENT OF NEUROSCIENCE, AZIENDA OSPEDALIERO-UNIVERSITARIA PISANA, PISA, ITALY.; 1ST OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY UNIT, DEPARTMENT OF NEUROSCIENCE, AZIENDA OSPEDALIERO-UNIVERSITARIA PISANA, PISA, ITALY.; RESPIRATORY PATHOPHYSIOLOGY UNIT, CARDIOTHORACIC AND VASCULAR DEPARTMENT, AZIENDA OSPEDALIERO-UNIVERSITARIA PISANA, PISA, ITALY.; RESPIRATORY PATHOPHYSIOLOGY UNIT, CARDIOTHORACIC AND VASCULAR DEPARTMENT, AZIENDA OSPEDALIERO-UNIVERSITARIA PISANA, PISA, ITALY.; RESPIRATORY PATHOPHYSIOLOGY UNIT, CARDIOTHORACIC AND VASCULAR DEPARTMENT, AZIENDA OSPEDALIERO-UNIVERSITARIA PISANA, PISA, ITALY.;",NA,"© 2018 S.

BALLOON DILATION EUSTACHIAN TUBOPLASTY (BDET) HAS BEEN RECENTLY PROPOSED FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF ETD. PREVIOUS STUDIES OF EUSTACHIAN TUBE FUNCTION AND TREATMENT HAVE NOT INCLUDED A VALIDATED ASSESSMENT OF PATIENT SYMPTOMS. WE REPORT FOR THE FIRST TIME THE OUTCOMES OF BDET USING A VALIDATED DISEASE-SPECIFIC SYMPTOM SCORE, THE 7-ITEM EUSTACHIAN TUBE DYSFUNCTION QUESTIONNAIRE (ETDQ-7). METHODS: CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS UNDERGOING BDET WERE PROSPECTIVELY ENROLLED FROM AN OTOLARYNGOLOGY PRACTICE AT A TERTIARY CARE MEDICAL CENTER. INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE ADULTS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF ETD BASED ON SYMPTOMS AND ABNORMAL TYMPANOGRAM. PATIENTS WITH CRANIOFACIAL ABNORMALITIES OR ACTIVE INFECTION WERE EXCLUDED FROM STUDY. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED THE ETDQ-7 SCORE, TYMPANOMETRY, AND OTOSCOPIC APPEARANCE. SECONDARY MEASURES INCLUDED THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) SCORE. RESULTS: TWENTY-TWO CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS UNDERWENT 35 BDET PROCEDURES. SIGNIFICANT POSTOPERATIVE IMPROVEMENT WAS SEEN IN TYMPANOMETRY AND OTOSCOPIC APPEARANCE (P < 0.001). ETDQ-7 SCORES AT 3 WEEKS, 6 WEEKS, 12 WEEKS, AND 6 MONTHS POSTOPERATIVELY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED OVER BASELINE (P < 0.001). ETDQ-7 SCORES SHOWED FAIR CORRELATION WITH SNOT-22 SCORES (R > 0.65). ETDQ-7 CHANGE SCORES DEMONSTRATED GOOD RESPONSIVENESS AND SENSITIVITY TO CLINICAL CHANGE FOLLOWING BDET. CONCLUSION: BDET IS AN EFFECTIVE SURGICAL INTERVENTION FOR THE TREATMENT OF ETD IN ADULTS. POSTOPERATIVE IMPROVEMENTS WERE OBSERVED USING OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE MEASURES. THE ETDQ-7 IS A VALID, DISEASE-SPECIFIC INSTRUMENT FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF TREATMENT OUTCOMES AND MAY BE APPLIED FOR CLINICAL USE IN PATIENTS WITH ETD.

HOWEVER, SERUM VITAMIN D CONCENTRATIONS MAY NOT REFLECT TISSUE-SPECIFIC AVAILABILITY. IN THIS STUDY WE SOUGHT TO ASSESS THE LOCAL EXPRESSION OF GENES ESSENTIAL IN VITAMIN D REGULATION IN CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS). METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY OF ADULT PATIENTS UNDERGOING ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY WAS PERFORMED. PATIENTS WERE DEFINED AS HAVING CRS WITH POLYPS (CRSWNP) OR WITHOUT POLYPS (CRSSNP), OR NORMAL SINUS MUCOSA. SINUS MUCOSAL BIOPSIES WERE ASSESSED USING QUANTITATIVE POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION TO DETERMINE EXPRESSION OF GENES ENCODING THE VITAMIN D RECEPTOR (VDR), 25-HYDROXYLASE (CYP2R1), 1<U+0391>-HYDROXYLASE (CYP27B1), AND 24-HYDROXYLASE (CYP24A1). EXPRESSION LEVELS CORRELATED WITH SERUM 25(OH)D [SUM 25(OH)D(2)  AND 25(OH)D(3) ], THE 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22), AND NASAL SYMPTOM SCORE (NSS). SEPARATE ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED FOR PATIENTS GROUPED BY TISSUE EOSINOPHILIA. RESULTS: THIRTY-ONE PATIENTS WERE ASSESSED (AGE 49.47 ± 18.14 YEARS, 48.4% FEMALE), INCLUDING 8 CRSSNP, 10 CRSWNP, AND 13 CONTROLS. CRSSNP AND CRSWNP MUCOSA EXHIBITED DECREASED CYP27B1 COMPARED WITH CONTROLS (0.0437 [INTERQUARTILE RANGE (IQR) 0.0999] VS 0.3260 [IQR 2.9384] VS 0.6557 [IQR 1.1005], P = 0.039), WHEREAS CYP24A1 WAS UPREGULATED (0.8522 [IQR 1.3170] VS 1.2239 [IQR 4.4197] VS 0.1076 [IQR 0.1791], P = 0.025). CYP24A1 WAS UPREGULATED IN BOTH NON-EOSINOPHILIC CRS AND EOSINOPHILIC CRS (1.1337 [IQR 2.3790] VS 0.9555 [IQR 3.2811] VS 0.1076 [IQR 0.1791], P = 0.033). SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN NSS AND CYP2R1 (R = -0.432, P = 0.022), CYP24A1 (R = 0.420, P = 0.026), AND VDR (R = 0.425, P = 0.024), ALTHOUGH NO CORRELATIONS WITH SERUM 25(OH)D WERE OBSERVED. CONCLUSIONS: THE LOCAL REGULATION OF VITAMIN D IN SINONASAL TISSUE DURING CRS MAY BE INDEPENDENT OF SERUM 25(OH)D LEVELS.

THE INTERNAL NASAL VALVE (INV) IS TYPICALLY THE NARROWEST PORTION OF THE NASAL CAVITY, AND IF THIS AREA COLLAPSES ON INSPIRATION THE PATIENT EXPERIENCES SIGNIFICANT SYMPTOMS OF NASAL OBSTRUCTION. THE NASAL OBSTRUCTION IS FURTHER COMPOUNDED IF THE INV IS NARROWER THAN NORMAL. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE EVALUATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TECHNIQUES TO ALLEVIATE STRUCTURAL NASAL OBSTRUCTION, BUT NONE HAVE LOOKED SPECIFICALLY AT SPREADER GRAFTS MEASURED BY ACOUSTIC RHINOMETRY OR VALIDATED GRADING ASSESSMENT OF DYNAMIC INV COLLAPSE. OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO EVALUATE THE APPLICATION OF ACOUSTIC RHINOMETRY COUPLED WITH VISUAL ENDOSCOPIC GRADING OF THE INV, AND VALIDATED SUBJECTIVE MEASUREMENTS, IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING ENDONASAL SPREADER GRAFT SURGERY WITH SEPTOPLASTY AND TURBINOPLASTY. METHODS: THIS IS A PROSPECTIVE CLINICAL STUDY CONDUCTED WITHIN A TERTIARY CARE RHINOPLASTY PRACTICE. PATIENTS UNDERGOING SEPTOPLASTY AND BILATERAL INFERIOR TURBINOPLASTY WITH BILATERAL ENDONASAL SPREADER GRAFT PLACEMENT FOR OBSERVED INTERNAL NASAL VALVE COLLAPSE WERE RECRUITED. BASELINE, EARLY AND INTERMEDIATE POSTOPERATIVE MEASURES WERE OBTAINED. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS GRADING OF THE INV COLLAPSE ON VIDEO ENDOSCOPY. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA AT THE INV MEASURED BY ACOUSTIC RHINOMETRY, SUBJECTIVE NASAL OBSTRUCTION SYMPTOM EVALUATION (NOSE) AND SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TOOL (SNOT-22) SCORES. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 17 PATIENTS, AVERAGE AGE OF 34.5 ± 12.2 YEARS, UNDERGOING SEPTOPLASTY, BILATERAL ENDONASAL SPREADER GRAFTS, AND BILATERAL TURBINOPLASTY WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. POSTOPERATIVE MEASUREMENTS WERE PERFORMED AT AN AVERAGE OF 8.1 ± 1.6 WEEKS AND 17.7 ± 4.2 WEEKS. PATIENTS HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT FOR INV COLLAPSE GRADING, CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA, NOSE AND SNOT-22 SCORES IN BOTH THE EARLY AND INTERMEDIATE FOLLOW UP. ENDOSCOPIC GRADING HAD MODERATE INTER-RATER AGREEMENT (<U+039A> = 0.579) AND AVERAGE INTRA-RATER AGREEMENT (<U+039A> = 0.545). CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY IS THE FIRST TO DEMONSTRATE A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OF OBJECTIVE MEASUREMENT OF INTERNAL NASAL VALVE FUNCTION, BOTH STATIC AND DYNAMIC, AND SUBJECTIVE IMPROVEMENTS. THIS SUPPORTS ENDONASAL CARTILAGENOUS SPREADER GRAFTS WITH SEPTOPLASTY AND INFERIOR TURBINOPLASTY FOR PATIENTS WITH NASAL OBSTRUCTION WITH INTERNAL NASAL VALVE COLLAPSE.","DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA, 1E4 WALTER C MACKENZIE CENTRE, 8440-112 STREET NW, EDMONTON, AB, T6G 2B7, CANADA.; BREE@UALBERTA.;CA.; FACULTY OF MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY, UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA, EDMONTON, AB, CANADA.; HUROWITZ@UALBERTA.;CA.; DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA, 1E4 WALTER C MACKENZIE CENTRE, 8440-112 STREET NW, EDMONTON, AB, T6G 2B7, CANADA.; CXU@UALBERTA.;CA.; DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA, 1E4 WALTER C MACKENZIE CENTRE, 8440-112 STREET NW, EDMONTON, AB, T6G 2B7, CANADA.; DR.;KALANSARI@GMAIL.;COM.; DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA, 1E4 WALTER C MACKENZIE CENTRE, 8440-112 STREET NW, EDMONTON, AB, T6G 2B7, CANADA.; HAMDY.;ELHAKIM@ALBERTAHEALTHSERVICES.;CA.; DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA, 1E4 WALTER C MACKENZIE CENTRE, 8440-112 STREET NW, EDMONTON, AB, T6G 2B7, CANADA.; ERIN.;WRIGHT@UALBERTA.;CA.; DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA, 1E4 WALTER C MACKENZIE CENTRE, 8440-112 STREET NW, EDMONTON, AB, T6G 2B7, CANADA.; HADI.;SEIKALY@ALBERTAHEALTHSERVICES.;CA.; DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA, 1E4 WALTER C MACKENZIE CENTRE, 8440-112 STREET NW, EDMONTON, AB, T6G 2B7, CANADA.; GRESA1@YAHOO.;CO.;NZ.; DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA, 1E4 WALTER C MACKENZIE CENTRE, 8440-112 STREET NW, EDMONTON, AB, T6G 2B7, CANADA.; DRDAVIDCOTE@ME.;COM.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016/01/13 06:00","20161020","20160112",2016,"2016/01/13 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1916-0216 (ELECTRONIC) 1916-0208 (PRINT) 1916-0208 (LINKING)","101479544","JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY - HEAD & NECK SURGERY = LE JOURNAL D'OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGIE ET DE CHIRURGIE CERVICO-FACIALE","ENG","10.1186/S40463-016-0115-9 [DOI] 2","20181113","2016/10/21 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","2",NA,"PMC4709971",NA,"26754620","EPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"J OTOLARYNGOL HEAD NECK SURG. 2016 JAN 12;45:2.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PRESENTED STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE SINONASAL QUALITY OF LIFE AND ASSESS THE EFFECT OF CHOSEN RECONSTRUCTION OF THE CRANIAL BASE ON THE FINAL CONDITION. 65 PATIENTS, 33 MALE AND 32 FEMALE WHO UNDERWENT AN ENDOSCOPIC ENDONASAL SURGERY DUE TO SELLAR EXPANSION, WERE INCLUDED INTO THIS PROSPECTIVE STUDY. SINONASAL QUALITY OF LIFE WAS EVALUATED USING THE SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22) QUESTIONNAIRE BEFORE THE SURGERY AND SIX MONTHS AFTER THE SURGERY. SINONASAL QUALITY OF LIFE WAS EVALUATED FOR THE TOTAL COHORT OF PATIENTS AND FOR PATIENTS AFTER RECONSTRUCTION (FASCIA LATA, MUSCLE) AND WITHOUT RECONSTRUCTION. THE MINIMUM FOLLOW-UP PERIOD WAS ONE YEAR. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SCORE (SNOT-22) BEFORE THE SURGERY (AVERAGE 14.4 POINTS) AND AFTER THE SURGERY (AVERAGE 17.5 POINTS), P = 0.067 IN THE WHOLE COHORT. STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND IN THE FOLLOWING ITEMS-THE NEED TO BLOW NOSE, NASAL CONGESTION, LOSS OF SMELL AND TASTE, AND THICK DISCHARGE FROM THE NOSE. THE COMPARISON OF SUBGROUPS WITH AND WITHOUT THE RECONSTRUCTION YIELDED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN FAVOUR OF PATIENTS WITH RECONSTRUCTION IN THE FOLLOWING ITEMS-LACK OF HIGH-QUALITY SLEEP AND FEELING EXHAUSTION. THE ENDOSCOPIC ENDONASAL APPROACH IN PATIENTS WITH A SELLAR TUMOUR IS A GENTLE METHOD WITH MINIMAL EFFECTS ON SINONASAL QUALITY OF LIFE OVER A PERIOD LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS. THE MOST COMMON COMPLAINTS ARE THE NEED TO BLOW NOSE, NASAL CONGESTION, LOSS OF SMELL AND TASTE, AND THICK DISCHARGE FROM THE NOSE.

ON ACCOUNT OF ITS MINIMAL INVASIVENESS AND PHYSIOLOGICAL APPROACH, FUNCTIONAL ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY (FESS) HAS COME TO REPLACE THE CALDWELL-LUC APPROACH FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS. CHRONIC MAXILLARY SINUSITIS OF DENTAL ORIGIN (CMSDO) IS A LESS COMMON VARIANT ON THE CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS SPECTRUM WHOSE TREATMENT INVOLVES SIMULTANEOUS MANAGEMENT OF BOTH THE DISEASED MAXILLARY SINUS AND THE DENTAL SOURCE OF INFECTION. THUS, THIS STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF FESS WHEN COMBINED WITH AN INTRA-ORAL APPROACH FOR THE TREATMENT OF CMSDO. MATERIAL AND METHODS: EIGHTEEN PATIENTS WITH CMSDO IN THE AGE GROUP OF 18-50 YEARS WERE TREATED WITH A COMBINED ENDOSCOPIC AND INTRA-ORAL APPROACH (BUCCAL ADVANCEMENT FLAP WITH/WITHOUT BUCCAL FAT PAD) IN THIS STUDY. THE PATIENTS WERE FOLLOWED UP FOR A TOTAL DURATION OF 18 MONTHS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS WERE THE SNOT-22 QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE AND THE LUND AND MACKAY CT SCAN SCORING CRITERIA. THE FRIEDMAN TEST WAS USED TO ASSESS IMPROVEMENT IN THE ABOVE VARIABLES AND THE LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE WAS SET AT 0.05. OBSERVATIONS AND RESULTS: THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION (P < 0.05) IN BOTH THE ABOVE PARAMETERS AT ALL POST-OPERATIVE INTERVALS. TWO PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH EPISTAXIS (IMMEDIATE POST-OPERATIVE PHASE) AND SYNECHIAE (SECOND WEEK FOLLOW-UP INTERVAL). BOTH COMPLICATIONS WERE SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED. TWO PATIENTS SHOWED RECURRENCE AT THE 6TH-MONTH INTERVAL FOR WHICH THEY UNDERWENT REVISION SURGERY SUCCESSFULLY. OVERALL, RESULTS WERE MAINTAINED EVEN AT THE 18TH MONTH FOLLOW-UP INTERVAL. CONCLUSION: THE ENDOSCOPIC APPROACH APPEARS TO BE A RELIABLE, MINIMALLY INVASIVE TECHNIQUE ASSOCIATED WITH LESS MORBIDITY AND STABLE LONG-TERM RESULTS. THUS, A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY APPROACH BETWEEN MAXILLOFACIAL SURGEONS AND OTOLARYNGOLOGISTS IS ESSENTIAL IN THE TREATMENT OF CMSDO.","DEPARTMENT OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY, GOVERNMENT DENTAL COLLEGE AND HOSPITAL MUMBAI, MUMBAI, MAHARASHTRA, 400001, INDIA.; DEPARTMENT OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY, GOVERNMENT DENTAL COLLEGE AND HOSPITAL MUMBAI, MUMBAI, MAHARASHTRA, 400001, INDIA.; PAULMATHAI89@GMAIL.;COM.; DEPARTMENT OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY, GOVERNMENT DENTAL COLLEGE AND HOSPITAL MUMBAI, MUMBAI, MAHARASHTRA, 400001, INDIA.; DEPARTMENT OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY, GOVERNMENT DENTAL COLLEGE AND HOSPITAL MUMBAI, MUMBAI, MAHARASHTRA, 400001, INDIA.; DEPARTMENT OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY, GOVERNMENT DENTAL COLLEGE AND HOSPITAL MUMBAI, MUMBAI, MAHARASHTRA, 400001, INDIA.; DEPARTMENT OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY, GOVERNMENT DENTAL COLLEGE AND HOSPITAL MUMBAI, MUMBAI, MAHARASHTRA, 400001, INDIA.; DEPARTMENT OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY, GOVERNMENT DENTAL COLLEGE AND HOSPITAL MUMBAI, MUMBAI, MAHARASHTRA, 400001, INDIA.;","ORCID: 0000-0002-9965-5263",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019/07/24 06:00","20191126","20190722",2019,"2019/07/25 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"4",NA,"1865-1569 (ELECTRONIC) 1865-1550 (LINKING)","101319632","ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY","ENG","10.1007/S10006-019-00792-Z [DOI]","20191126","2019/11/27 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","429-437","GERMANY",NA,NA,"31332583","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"ORAL MAXILLOFAC SURG. 2019 DEC;23(4):429-437.

THERE ARE REPORTS THAT LINK OBESITY WITH AN INCREASED PREVALENCE OF SINONASAL DISEASE, BUT NO STUDIES EVALUATING THE SEVERITY OF SINONASAL DISEASE IN OBESE ASTHMATICS, AND HOW THIS IMPACTS ASTHMA CONTROL. THE PURPOSE OF THE CURRENT STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE IF OBESITY IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED SEVERITY OF SINONASAL DISEASE, AND/OR AFFECTS RESPONSE TO NASAL CORTICOSTEROID TREATMENT IN ASTHMA. METHODS: THIS STUDY INCLUDED 236 ADULTS PARTICIPATING IN A 24-WEEK RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-MASKED, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED STUDY OF NASAL MOMETASONE FOR THE TREATMENT OF POORLY CONTROLLED ASTHMA. SINONASAL DISEASE SEVERITY WAS ASSESSED USING VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRES, AND COMPARED IN PARTICIPANTS OF DIFFERING BMIS. EOSINOPHILIC INFLAMMATION WAS ASSESSED USING MARKERS IN NASAL LAVAGE, SERUM AND EXHALED NITRIC OXIDE. RESPONSE TO TREATMENT WAS COMPARED IN DIFFERENT BMI GROUPS. RESULTS: OBESITY HAD NO EFFECT ON THE SEVERITY OF SINONASAL DISEASE SYMPTOMS IN ASTHMATICS (SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST 22 (SNOT 22) SCORE [MEAN ± SD] 35.4 ± 18.5, 40.2 ± 22.8, AND 39.1 ± 21.7, P = 0.43, IN LEAN, OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE PARTICIPANTS), NOR ON NASAL, BRONCHIAL OR SYSTEMIC MARKERS OF ALLERGIC INFLAMMATION. NASAL STEROIDS HAD SOME LIMITED EFFECTS ON SYMPTOMS, LUNG FUNCTION AND INFLAMMATORY MARKERS IN LEAN PARTICIPANTS, BUT NO DETECTABLE EFFECT WAS FOUND IN OBESE PATIENTS. CONCLUSIONS: OBESITY DOES NOT AFFECT SEVERITY OF SINONASAL DISEASE IN PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA; THE ASSOCIATION OF SINONASAL DISEASE SYMPTOMS WITH INCREASED ASTHMA SEVERITY AND MARKERS OF TYPE 2 INFLAMMATION ARE CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL BMI GROUPS.

PATIENTS ALSO COMPLETED SURVEYS REGARDING RHINOLOGIC OUTCOMES INCLUDING THE SINUSITIS SYMPTOM QUESTIONNAIRE (SSQ) AND THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AT THE FOLLOWING TIME POINTS: PREOPERATIVELY, AND 1 WEEK, 4 WEEKS, 12 WEEKS, 6 MONTHS, 1 YEAR, AND 2 YEARS POSTSURGERY. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) WERE UNDERTAKEN. RESULTS: ELEVEN PATIENTS (22 SIDES) UNDERWENT BILATERAL VIDIAN NEURECTOMY WITH PATHOLOGIC CONFIRMATION OF NERVE SECTION IN ALL CASES. AVERAGE FOLLOW-UP WAS 19.4 MONTHS. STATISTICALLY AND CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WAS MEASURED FOR BOTH THE SSQ AND THE SNOT-22 AND COMPARED WITH THE PATIENTS' BASELINE SCORES (P < 0.0001). SUBSCORES FOR RHINORRHEA AND NASAL CONGESTIONS WERE ALSO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED (P < 0.05). NO INCIDENCE OF PERMANENT OR MEASUREABLE DRY EYE HAS BEEN REPORTED. CONCLUSION: THE DATA SUGGESTS THAT VIDIAN NEURECTOMY IS AN EFFECTIVE, SAFE, AND DEFINITIVE TREATMENT FOR MOST PATIENTS WITH VMR REFRACTORY TO MEDICAL TREATMENT.","DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA, EDMONTON, ALBERTA, CANADA.; DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, NORTHERN ONTARIO SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, THUNDER BAY, ONTARIO, CANADA.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA, GAINESVILLE, FL.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, WESTERN UNIVERSITY, LONDON, ONTARIO, CANADA.; DIVISION OF OPHTHALMOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA, EDMONTON, ALBERTA, CANADA.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA, EDMONTON, ALBERTA, CANADA.;",NA,"© 2015 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,"2015/03/04 06:00","20160211","20150302",2015,"2015/03/04 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"5",NA,"2042-6984 (ELECTRONIC) 2042-6976 (LINKING)","101550261","INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY","ENG","10.1002/ALR.21462 [DOI]","20160511","2016/02/13 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","423-30","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"25732231","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"INT FORUM ALLERGY RHINOL. 2015 MAY;5(5):423-30.

HIGH-VOLUME IRRIGATIONS HAVE PROVED BENEFICIAL IN THIS SETTING. THE ADDITION OF CORTICOSTEROID TO THE IRRIGATION IS USED FOR CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS) IN MODIFYING THE POSTSURGICAL INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE; HOWEVER, ITS EFFECT IN ENDOSCOPIC SINONASAL TUMOR RESECTION IS UNKNOWN. SALINE ALONE VERSUS COMBINATION SALINE AND CORTICOSTEROID IRRIGATIONS IN POSTOPERATIVE NASAL CARE OF SINONASAL TUMOR PATIENTS WAS ASSESSED. METHODS: A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT OF PATIENTS POSTENDOSCOPIC ENDONASAL TUMOR RESECTION WAS ASSESSED. PATIENTS USED 240 ML OF SALINE OR 240 ML OF SALINE WITH 1 MG OF BETAMETHASONE DAILY. NASAL SYMPTOM SCORES (NSSS) AND THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) WAS RECORDED 3 MONTHS POSTOPERATIVELY. AN ENDOSCOPIC SCORE WAS MADE OF THE AREA UNDERGOING SECONDARY HEALING AT 3 MONTHS BY TWO BLINDED ASSESSORS. RESULTS: FIFTY-NINE PATIENTS WERE ASSESSED (AGED 50.1 ± 18.26 YEARS; 36% FEMALE SUBJECTS). THE GROUPS WERE SIMILAR IN NUMBER (SALINE N = 31), TREATMENT, AND SURGICAL CHARACTERISTICS. THE ENDOSCOPIC SCORES DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN THE GROUPS AT 3 MONTHS.

CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH CORTICOSTEROID IRRIGATIONS HAVE BECOME ROUTINE FOR MANAGING INFLAMMATORY SINUS DISEASE AT OUR CENTER, THEIR USE AFTER TUMOR SURGERY DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE WARRANTED.

POSTOPERATIVE CARE HAS BEEN FELT TO BE CRITICAL FOR BOTH MAINTAINING THE SURGICAL PATENCY OF THE OPERATED SINUSES AND IMPROVING PATIENT SYMPTOMS. DEBRIDEMENT OF THE SINONASAL CAVITIES IS ONE SUCH POSTOPERATIVE CARE MEASURE THAT HAS FREQUENTLY BEEN STUDIED IN THE LITERATURE, OFTEN WITH CONFLICTING CONCLUSIONS. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF POSTOPERATIVE SINONASAL DEBRIDEMENT VERSUS NO DEBRIDEMENT FOLLOWING ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY. SEARCH METHODS: THE COCHRANE ENT INFORMATION SPECIALIST SEARCHED THE ENT TRIALS REGISTER; CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL, VIA THE COCHRANE REGISTER OF STUDIES); PUBMED; EMBASE; WEB OF SCIENCE; CLINICALTRIALS.GOV; ICTRP AND ADDITIONAL SOURCES FOR PUBLISHED AND UNPUBLISHED TRIALS. THE DATE OF THE SEARCH WAS 21 MAY 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS COMPARING POSTOPERATIVE NASAL DEBRIDEMENT VERSUS NO DEBRIDEMENT IN ADULT PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT ACUTE OR CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS UNDERGOING ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY. WE INCLUDED STUDIES IN WHICH THE PATIENTS ACTED AS SELF-CONTROLS (I.E. ONE SIDE OF THE NOSE UNDERWENT DEBRIDEMENT AND THE OTHER SIDE DID NOT) ONLY FOR THE SECONDARY ENDOSCOPY OUTCOMES. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: WE USED THE STANDARD METHODOLOGICAL PROCEDURES EXPECTED BY COCHRANE. OUR PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES WERE: HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, DISEASE SEVERITY (PATIENT-REPORTED SYMPTOM SCORES) AND SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECTS (BLEEDING REQUIRING INTERVENTION, SEVERE PAIN, IATROGENIC INJURY). SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE: POSTOPERATIVE ENDOSCOPIC APPEARANCE OF THE SINONASAL SURGICAL CAVITIES (ENDOSCOPIC SCORES), RECORDED USE OF POSTOPERATIVE MEDICAL TREATMENT AND RATE OF REVISION SURGERY. WE USED GRADE TO ASSESS THE QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE FOR EACH OUTCOME; THIS IS INDICATED IN ITALICS. MAIN RESULTS: WE INCLUDED FOUR STUDIES (152 PARTICIPANTS), WITH A FOLLOW-UP DURATION RANGING FROM THREE MONTHS TO 12 MONTHS. IN TWO STUDIES PATIENTS ACTED AS SELF-CONTROLS, I.E. ONE SIDE OF THE NOSE UNDERWENT DEBRIDEMENT AND THE OTHER SIDE DID NOT ('SPLIT-NOSE' STUDIES). THE RISK OF BIAS IN ALL STUDIES WAS HIGH, MOSTLY DUE TO THE INABILITY TO BLIND THE PATIENTS TO THE DEBRIDEMENT PROCEDURE.PRIMARY OUTCOMESDISEASE-SPECIFIC HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE SCORESONLY ONE STUDY (58 PARTICIPANTS) PROVIDED DATA FOR DISEASE-SPECIFIC HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. AT SIX MONTHS FOLLOW-UP, LOWER DISEASE-SPECIFIC HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES, MEASURED USING THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22, RANGE 0 TO 110), WERE NOTED IN THE DEBRIDEMENT GROUP BUT THE DIFFERENCE WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (9.7 IN THE DEBRIDEMENT GROUP VERSUS 10.3 IN THE CONTROL GROUP, P = 0.47) (LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE).DISEASE SEVERITY (PATIENT-REPORTED SYMPTOM SCORE)ONLY ONE STUDY (60 PARTICIPANTS) PROVIDED DATA FOR DISEASE SEVERITY MEASURED BY VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) SCORE. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN TOTAL SYMPTOM SCORE WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN GROUPS POSTOPERATIVELY (LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE).SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECTSSIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECTS RELATED TO THE DEBRIDEMENT PROCEDURE WERE NOT REPORTED IN ANY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES, HOWEVER IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER DATA REGARDING ADVERSE EFFECTS WERE NOT COLLECTED OR IF NONE WERE INDEED OBSERVED IN ANY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES.SECONDARY OUTCOMESALL FOUR STUDIES ASSESSED THEPOSTOPERATIVE ENDOSCOPIC APPEARANCE OF THE SINONASAL CAVITIES USING THE LUND-KENNEDY SCORE (RANGE 0 TO 10). A POOLED ANALYSIS OF ENDOSCOPIC SCORES IN THE TWO NON 'SPLIT-NOSE' STUDIES REVEALED BETTER ENDOSCOPIC SCORES IN THE DEBRIDEMENT GROUP, HOWEVER THIS WAS NOT A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (MEAN DIFFERENCE -0.31, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) -1.35 TO 0.72; I² = 0%; TWO STUDIES; 118 PARTICIPANTS) (LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE). A SUB-ANALYSIS OF THE ADHESION FORMATION COMPONENT OF THE ENDOSCOPIC SCORE WAS AVAILABLE FOR ALL FOUR STUDIES AND REVEALED A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER ADHESION RATE IN THE DEBRIDEMENT GROUP (RISK RATIO 0.43, 95% CI 0.28 TO 0.68; I² = 29%; FOUR STUDIES; 152 PARTICIPANTS). ANALYSIS OF THE NUMBER NEEDED TO TREAT TO BENEFIT REVEALED THAT FOR EVERY THREE PATIENTS UNDERGOING DEBRIDEMENT, THE ENDOSCOPIC SCORE WOULD BE DECREASED BY ONE POINT IN ONE PATIENT. FOR EVERY FIVE PATIENTS UNDERGOING DEBRIDEMENT ADHESION FORMATION WOULD BE PREVENTED IN ONE PATIENT.USE OF POSTOPERATIVE MEDICAL TREATMENT WAS REPORTED IN ALL STUDIES, ALL OF WHICH RECOMMENDED NASAL DOUCHING. STEROIDS (SYSTEMIC OR NASAL) WERE ADMINISTERED IN TWO STUDIES. HOWEVER, THE DATA WERE VERY LIMITED AND HETEROGENEOUS, THEREFORE WE COULD NOT ANALYSE THE IMPACT OF CONCOMITANT POSTOPERATIVE MEDICAL TREATMENT.THE RATE OF REVISION SURGERY WAS NOT REPORTED IN ANY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES, HOWEVER IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER THESE DATA WERE NOT RECORDED OR IF THERE WERE NO REVISION SURGERIES IN ANY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: WE ARE UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF POSTOPERATIVE SINONASAL DEBRIDEMENT DUE TO HIGH RISK OF BIAS IN THE INCLUDED STUDIES AND THE LOW QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE. SINONASAL DEBRIDEMENT MAY MAKE LITTLE OR NO DIFFERENCE TO DISEASE-SPECIFIC HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE OR DISEASE SEVERITY. LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT POSTOPERATIVE DEBRIDEMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER RISK OF ADHESIONS AT THREE MONTHS FOLLOW-UP.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE ROLE OF NSI AS A PREOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT AND TO IDENTIFY THE PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS WHO ULTIMATELY UNDERWENT ESS FOR RECALCITRANT CRS DESPITE BEING ON NSI. METHODS: RETROSPECTIVE CHART REVIEW OF PATIENTS PRESENTING WITH CRS WHO UNDERWENT A TRIAL OF NSI FOR AT LEAST SIX WEEKS. PRE-IRRIGATION AND POST-IRRIGATION OUTCOMES MEASURED INCLUDED LUND-MACKAY SCORES (LMS), SNOT-22 SCORES, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PATIENT UNDERWENT ESS. RESULTS: OF THE 90 PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT NSI, 32 PATIENTS UNDERWENT ESS, WHILE 58 PATIENTS HAD A SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH IMPROVEMENT IN SYMPTOMS TO AVOID ESS. THE LIKELIHOOD OF DECISION FOR SURGERY DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN THE MOMETASONE AND BUDESONIDE GROUPS (P=0.3094), COMORBID ASTHMA STATUS (P=0.3585), SMOKING STATUS (P=0.2256), POLYP STATUS (P=0.7288), OR HISTORY OF PRIOR ESS (P=0.5803).

CONCLUSIONS: AFTER A TRIAL OF NSI, 64.4% OF PATIENTS WITH CRS NO LONGER MET CANDIDACY FOR ESS AND HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SNOT-22 SCORES.

HERE, SINONASAL PATHOLOGY IS STUDIED IN PATIENTS WITH ALLERGIC ASTHMA, NONALLERGIC ASTHMA AND COPD. METHODS: NINETY PATIENTS WITH STABLE BRONCHIAL DISEASE WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY, OF WHICH 35 WERE DIAGNOSED WITH ALLERGIC ASTHMA, 24 WITH NONALLERGIC ASTHMA AND 31 WITH COPD. CONCURRENTLY, 61 CONTROL SUBJECTS WITHOUT PULMONARY DISEASE WERE INCLUDED AND MATCHED FOR AGE AND SMOKING HABITS RESPECTIVELY WITH THE ASTHMA AND THE COPD GROUP. SINONASAL SYMPTOMS WERE EVALUATED ON A VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE AND RHINOSINUSITIS-RELATED IMPAIRMENT OF QUALITY OF LIFE WAS ASSESSED WITH THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22) QUESTIONNAIRE. NASAL MUCOSAL ABNORMALITIES WERE QUANTIFIED WITH NASAL ENDOSCOPY AND NASAL SECRETIONS COLLECTED FOR MEASURING INFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS. RESULTS: ALLERGIC ASTHMATICS, NONALLERGIC ASTHMATICS AND COPD PATIENTS REPORTED MORE NASAL SYMPTOMS THAN THEIR RESPECTIVE CONTROL SUBJECTS, HAD A HIGHER SNOT-22 SCORE AND PRESENTED MORE MUCOSAL ABNORMALITIES IN THE NOSE. NASAL SECRETIONS OF BOTH ALLERGIC AND NONALLERGIC ASTHMATICS CONTAINED HIGHER LEVELS OF EOTAXIN, G-CSF, IFN-GAMMA AND MCP-1 THAN CONTROLS. ALLERGIC ASTHMATICS HAD HIGHER NASAL IP-10 LEVELS AS WELL. COPD-PATIENTS HAD HIGHER NASAL LEVELS OF EOTAXIN, G-CSF AND IFN-GAMMA THAN CONTROLS. CONCLUSION: PATIENTS WITH ALLERGIC AND NONALLERGIC ASTHMA AND COPD SHOW INCREASED NASAL SYMPTOMS AND MORE NASAL INFLAMMATION. HENCE, OUR DATA CONFIRM THE 'UNITED AIRWAYS' CONCEPT TO BE BEYOND THE SCOPE OF ALLERGIC ASTHMA.","DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY, HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS LEUVEN, CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY LEUVEN, LEUVEN, BELGIUM.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2007/12/07 09:00","20080313","20071205",2008,"2007/12/07 09:00",NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,"1398-9995 (ELECTRONIC) 0105-4538 (LINKING)","7804028","ALLERGY","ENG",NA,"20080213","2008/03/14 09:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","261-7","DENMARK",NA,NA,"18053011","PPUBLISH","0 (INFLAMMATION MEDIATORS)","IM",NA,"ALLERGY. 2008 MAR;63(3):261-7.

METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A MULTICENTER OBSERVATIONAL STUDY, INCLUDING PATIENTS WITH SEA TREATED WITH BENRALIZUMAB FOR 24 WEEKS IN 12 ITALIAN SPECIALIZED FACILITIES. ASTHMA EXACERBATIONS, ASTHMA CONTROL TEST (ACT), LUNG FUNCTION, ORAL CORTICOSTEROID (OCS) DOSAGE, AND EOSINOPHIL AND BASOPHIL COUNT IN PERIPHERAL BLOOD WERE RECORDED AT BASELINE AND AFTER 4, 12, AND 24 WEEKS. THE 22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AND LUND-MACKAY SCORES WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND AFTER 24 WEEKS IN SEA+CRSWNP. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 137 PATIENTS WITH LATE-ONSET SEA WERE INCLUDED; 57.7% (79 OF 137) SHOWED THE COPRESENCE OF CRSWNP. OVERALL, SEVERE ASTHMA EXACERBATIONS DECREASED FROM 4 (3-6) TO 0 (0-2) (P < .0001) AFTER 24 WEEKS OF TREATMENT, AND SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE OBSERVED AS EARLY AS 4 WEEKS IN ACT SCORE, OCS DOSAGE, FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN THE 1ST SECOND (FEV(1))%, FEV(1) (L), FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC)%, FEV(1)/FVC% (P < .0001), AND FORCED EXPIRATORY FLOW BETWEEN 25% AND 75% OF FVC (FEF(25-75))% (P = .0022). EOSINOPHILS AND BASOPHILS IN PERIPHERAL BLOOD WERE RAPIDLY DEPLETED. IN PATIENTS WITH SEA+CRSWNP, SNOT-22 DECREASED FROM 46 (39.5-64.5) TO 32 (19-46) (P < .0001). FURTHERMORE, IN COMPARISON WITH SEA, THEY SHOWED ENHANCED RESPONSES WITH REGARD TO ACT MINIMAL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE (P = .0387), FEV(1)% (P = .017), FEV(1) (L) (P = .02), AND FEF(25-75)% (P = .0362).

OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ANALYZE CORRELATIONS IN TRENDS IN GOOGLE ONLINE SEARCH VOLUMES OF SINUSITIS-RELATED TERMS, INCLUDING SYMPTOMATOLOGY AND SIMILAR DISEASE STATES. METHODS: TERMS CLINICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH \"SINUSITIS\" WERE DETERMINED BY CONSENSUS. TERMS OF SYMPTOMATOLOGY WERE DERIVED FROM THE VALIDATED 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT-22) AS WELL AS TERMINOLOGY ENCOUNTERED WITH THE AUTHORS' CLINICAL EXPERIENCE. TERMS OF DISEASE STATES THAT COULD OVERLAP IN SYMPTOMATOLOGY WITH SINUSITIS WERE THEN CHOSEN. GOOGLE TRENDS, AN ONLINE TOOL FOR EXTRACTING RELATIVE FREQUENCIES FROM A PUBLIC DATABASE OF SEARCH QUERIES, WAS USED TO QUERY NORMALIZED MONTHLY VOLUMES IN THE UNITED STATES FROM JANUARY 2004 TO SEPTEMBER 2017 OF SEARCHES RELATED TO THE TOPICS DECIDED UPON BY CONSENSUS. BIVARIATE PEARSON CORRELATION WAS USED TO COMPARE THE SEARCH QUERIES. RESULTS: ONLINE SEARCH VOLUMES OF \"SINUSITIS\" HAVE A DISTINCT SEASONAL VARIATION, WITH CONSISTENT ANNUAL PEAKS AND TROUGHS. IN TERMS OF SYMPTOMATOLOGY, \"POSTNASAL DRIP,\" \"NASAL CONGESTION,\" \"COUGH,\" \"RHINORRHEA,\" AND \"SORE THROAT\" MOST HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH \"SINUSITIS\" SEARCH VOLUMES WITH STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. \"SINUSITIS\" SEARCH QUERY VOLUME HAD A HIGHER POSITIVE CORRELATION WITH \"COMMON COLD\" AND \"ACUTE SINUSITIS\" THAN \"CHRONIC SINUSITIS\" WITH REGARD TO DISEASE STATES.

HOWEVER, SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATORY PROFILING TO EVALUATE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION AND QOL IN CRS HAS NOT BEEN PERFORMED. OUR OBJECTIVES WERE TO COMPARE LOCAL AND SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATORY GENE EXPRESSION IN PATIENTS WITH CRS TO DETERMINE IF SYSTEMIC MARKERS OF INFLAMMATION ASSOCIATE WITH DISEASE SEVERITY AND DISEASE-SPECIFIC QOL. METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED COMPARING 16 PATIENTS WITH CRS TO 10 CONTROLS. INFLAMMATORY GENE EXPRESSION IN THE ANTERIOR ETHMOID TISSUES AND PERIPHERAL BLOOD OF PATIENTS WAS MEASURED USING MULTIPLEX GENE EXPRESSION ANALYSIS AND CORRELATED TO DISEASE SEVERITY (COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY AND NASAL ENDOSCOPY) AND DISEASE-SPECIFIC QOL (22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST [SNOT-22] AND RHINOSINUSITIS DISABILITY INDEX) USING LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSES.

METHODS: THIS RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY RECRUITED 376 ADULT CRS PATIENTS UNDERGOING FESS BETWEEN OCTOBER 1, 2007 TO DECEMBER 31, 2011. PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS, COMORBIDITIES AND MEDICATIONS WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE. TRIMETHOPRIM-SULFAMETHOXAZOLE AND CLINDAMYCIN WERE ADMINISTERED FOR 2 WEEKS POSTOPERATIVELY. THE ANTIBIOTIC APPROPRIATENESS WAS DETERMINED BASED ON BACTERIAL RESISTANCE PROFILE OF ORGANISMS IDENTIFIED DURING INTRAOPERATIVE CULTURE. THE QOL OUTCOME WAS DEFINED AS CHANGE OF 22-ITEM SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST SCORES FROM PREOPERATIVE VISIT TO 1-MONTH, 3-MONTH, AND 6-MONTH POST-FESS. CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS DEFINED AS AT LEAST 0.5 STANDARD DEVIATIONS (SD) OF BASELINE QOL SCORE IN THE REFERENCE GROUP. MIXED-EFFECTS REGRESSION MODELS WERE PERFORMED. RESULTS: SEVEN PERCENT OF PATIENTS (N = 27) HAD CULTURE-INAPPROPRIATE ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY, AND ADDITIONAL 5% (N = 19) HAD CULTURE-SPECIFIC ANTIBIOTIC ADJUSTMENT. COMPARED TO PATIENTS WITH CULTURE-APPROPRIATE ANTIBIOTICS, PATIENTS WITH CULTURE-INAPPROPRIATE ANTIBIOTICS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LESS IMPROVEMENT OF QOL FROM BASELINE TO POSTOPERATIVE 1-MONTH AND 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP WHERE THE DIFFERENCE BECAME CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT; PATIENTS WITH ANTIBIOTIC ADJUSTMENT HAD MORE QOL IMPROVEMENT FROM BASELINE TO 1-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, BUT THEIR QOL WORSENED AT 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, AND THESE CHANGES WERE NOT CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT. HOWEVER, ALL EFFECTS WASHED OUT AT 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP WITH NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES.

METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE, SINGLE-CENTER STUDY TREATING 5 ADULT PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT POLYPOSIS AFTER BILATERAL TOTAL ETHMOIDECTOMY. EACH PATIENT RECEIVED 2 STEROID-RELEASING IMPLANTS IN-OFFICE UNDER LOCAL/TOPICAL ANESTHESIA. PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS OF MOMETASONE FUROATE AND CORTISOL WERE DETERMINED BEFORE PLACEMENT AND THROUGH 30-DAY FOLLOW-UP, WHICH ALSO INCLUDED ENDOSCOPIC GRADING AND PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES. RESULTS: FIVE PATIENTS (MEAN AGE 46.2 ± 9.2 STANDARD DEVIATION [SD] YEARS; 60% MALE) UNDERWENT SUCCESSFUL PLACEMENT IN ALL 10 ETHMOID SINUSES. THERE WERE NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS. THE PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS OF MOMETASONE FUROATE WERE GENERALLY BELOW THE LOWER LIMIT OF QUANTIFICATION (LLOQ) OF THE ASSAY (30 PG/ML). CORTISOL CONCENTRATIONS AT FOLLOW-UP RANGED FROM 3.9 TO 5.7 MG/DL COMPARED TO 4.7 MG/DL AT BASELINE.

RECENTLY, THE ENDOSCOPIC ENDONASAL SINUS AND SKULL BASE SURGERY QUESTIONNAIRE (EES-Q) WAS DEVELOPED TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF ENDOSCOPIC ENDONASAL SURGERY ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL). THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY, CONSTRUCT VALIDITY AND RESPONSIVENESS OF THE EES-Q. DESIGN: PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. SETTING: UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER GRONINGEN, TERTIARY REFERRAL HOSPITAL, THE NETHERLANDS. PARTICIPANTS: ONE HUNDRED PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT ENDOSCOPIC ENDONASAL SURGERY BECAUSE OF SINUS OR ANTERIOR SKULL BASE PATHOLOGY. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY, CONSTRUCT VALIDITY AND RESPONSIVENESS. RESULTS: THE EES-Q DOMAINS EXHIBITED GOOD TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY (ICC > 0.90). CONSTRUCT VALIDITY WAS CORROBORATED BY SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THE EES-Q AND THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22) AND POSTOPERATIVE HEALTH STATUS (P < 0.01) RESPECTIVELY. THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE SOCIAL EES-Q DOMAIN AND THE ABILITY TO MOVE AND PERFORM USUAL ACTIVITIES (EUROQOL-5D-3L [EQ-5D-3L]) WAS SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE (P < 0.01). IN PATIENTS WITH PARANASAL SINUS PATHOLOGY, THE EES-Q WAS RESPONSIVE TO CLINICAL CHANGE (COHEN'S D = 0.6). CONCLUSION: THE EES-Q IS A RELIABLE AND ACCEPTABLE RESPONSIVE DISEASE-SPECIFIC HRQOL INSTRUMENT. THE EXPECTED CONSTRUCT VALIDITY OF THE EES-Q IS SUPPORTED BY THE RESULTS IN THIS STUDY. INCONVENIENCES IN SOCIAL FUNCTIONING HAD THE GREATEST NEGATIVE IMPACT ON POSTOPERATIVE HEALTH STATUS RATING. THIS REFLECTS THE IMPORTANCE OF A MULTIDIMENSIONAL HRQOL ASSESSMENT AFTER EES. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE EES-Q IS A PROMISING DISEASE-SPECIFIC TOOL FOR THE HRQOL ASSESSMENT AFTER ENDOSCOPIC ENDONASAL SINUS OR ANTERIOR SKULL BASE SURGERY.","DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER GRONINGEN, UNIVERSITY OF GRONINGEN, GRONINGEN, THE NETHERLANDS.; GRADUATE SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES, GRONINGEN UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE FOR DRUG EXPLORATION, GRONINGEN, THE NETHERLANDS.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER GRONINGEN, UNIVERSITY OF GRONINGEN, GRONINGEN, THE NETHERLANDS.; DEPARTMENT OF NEUROSURGERY, PRINCESS MAXIMA CENTER FOR PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY, UMC UTRECHT, UTRECHT, THE NETHERLANDS.; DEPARTMENT OF NEUROSURGERY, UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER GRONINGEN, UNIVERSITY OF GRONINGEN, GRONINGEN, THE NETHERLANDS.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER GRONINGEN, UNIVERSITY OF GRONINGEN, GRONINGEN, THE NETHERLANDS.; DEPARTMENT OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER GRONINGEN, UNIVERSITY OF GRONINGEN, GRONINGEN, THE NETHERLANDS.; DEPARTMENT OF EPIDEMIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER GRONINGEN, UNIVERSITY OF GRONINGEN, GRONINGEN, THE NETHERLANDS.;","ORCID: 0000-0002-3298-8119 ORCID: 0000-0002-5016-2871","© 2019 JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD.",NA,NA,NA,"2019/03/23 06:00","20200803","20190414",2019,"2019/03/23 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"4",NA,"1749-4486 (ELECTRONIC) 1749-4478 (LINKING)","101247023","CLINICAL OTOLARYNGOLOGY : OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF ENT-UK ; OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF NETHERLANDS SOCIETY FOR OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY & CERVICO-FACIAL SURGERY","ENG","10.1111/COA.13334 [DOI]","20200803","2020/08/04 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","565-571","ENGLAND",NA,NA,"30901156","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"CLIN OTOLARYNGOL. 2019 JUL;44(4):565-571.

OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE THE PRESENCE OF SINONASAL MANIFESTATIONS AT THE ONSET OF COVID-19 TO ACHIEVE AN EARLIER DIAGNOSIS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: THIS RETROSPECTIVE TELEPHONE SURVEY STUDY INVESTIGATED PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH COVID-19 FROM MARCH 5 TO MARCH 23, 2020, WHO WERE HOSPITALIZED OR DISCHARGED FROM A SINGLE REFERRAL CENTER. PATIENTS WHO WERE UNABLE TO ANSWER (INTUBATED, RECEIVING NONINVASIVE VENTILATION, OR DECEASED) OR UNREACHABLE BY TELEPHONE WERE EXCLUDED. OF 359 CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS, 204 FULFILLED THE INCLUSION CRITERIA; 76 WERE UNABLE TO ANSWER, 76 WERE UNREACHABLE BY TELEPHONE, AND 3 REFUSED. EXPOSURES: SINONASAL MANIFESTATIONS REPORTED BEFORE COVID-19 DIAGNOSIS WERE STUDIED WITH A VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRE: ITALIAN SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST 22 (I-SNOT-22). IF REDUCTION OF TASTE AND/OR SMELL WAS DOCUMENTED BY ITEM 5 OF THE I-SNOT-22, FURTHER INQUIRIES WERE MADE TO SCORE THEM SEPARATELY ON A SCALE FROM 0 TO 5, WITH 0 INDICATING NO PROBLEM AND 5 INDICATING PROBLEM AS BAD AS IT CAN BE. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: THE PREVALENCE OF SINONASAL MANIFESTATIONS PRECEDING COVID-19 DIAGNOSIS. RESULTS: AMONG THE 204 PATIENTS ENROLLED (110 [53.9%] MALE; MEAN [SD] AGE, 52.6 [14.4] YEARS), THE MEDIAN I-SNOT-22 TOTAL SCORE WAS 21 (RANGE, 0-73). I-SNOT-22 IDENTIFIED 116 PATIENTS (56.9%) WITH REDUCTION OF TASTE AND/OR SMELL, 113 (55.4%) WITH TASTE REDUCTION (MEDIAN SCORE, 5; RANGE, 2-5), AND 85 (41.7%) WITH SMELL REDUCTION (MEDIAN SCORE, 5; RANGE, 1-5). EIGHTY-TWO PATIENTS (40.2%) REPORTED BOTH. SEVERE REDUCTION OF TASTE WAS PRESENT IN 81 PATIENTS (39.7%), AND SEVERE REDUCTION OF SMELL WAS PRESENT IN 72 PATIENTS (35.3%). ONLY 12 PATIENTS (14.8%) WITH SEVERE TASTE REDUCTION AND 12 PATIENTS (16.7%) WITH SEVERE SMELL REDUCTION REPORTED SEVERE NASAL OBSTRUCTION. SEVERE REDUCTION OF TASTE AND SMELL WAS MORE PREVALENT IN FEMALE VS MALE PATIENTS (ODDS RATIOS, 3.16 [95% CI, 1.76-5.67] VS 2.58 [95% CI, 1.43-4.65]) AND MIDDLE-AGED VS YOUNGER PATIENTS (EFFECT SIZES, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.21-0.78] VS 0.85 [95% CI, 0.55-1.15]). NO SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN SMOKING HABITS AND SEVERE REDUCTION OF TASTE (ODDS RATIO, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.53-1.71) AND/OR SMELL (ODDS RATIO, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.35-1.21). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: THE FINDINGS OF THIS TELEPHONE SURVEY STUDY SUGGEST THAT REDUCTION OF TASTE AND/OR SMELL MAY BE A FREQUENT AND EARLY SYMPTOM OF COVID-19. NASAL OBSTRUCTION WAS NOT COMMONLY PRESENT AT THE ONSET OF THE DISEASE IN THIS STUDY. THE GENERAL PRACTITIONER MAY PLAY A PIVOTAL ROLE IN IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL COVID-19 IN PATIENTS AT AN EARLY STAGE IF TASTE AND/OR SMELL ALTERATIONS MANIFEST AND IN SUGGESTING QUARANTINE BEFORE CONFIRMATION OR EXCLUSION OF THE DIAGNOSIS.","DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES, HUMANITAS UNIVERSITY, PIEVE EMANUELE, MILAN, ITALY.; OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY UNIT, HUMANITAS CLINICAL AND RESEARCH CENTER, SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH, HOSPITALIZATION AND HEALTHCARE (IRCCS), ROZZANO, MILAN, ITALY.; DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES, HUMANITAS UNIVERSITY, PIEVE EMANUELE, MILAN, ITALY.; OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY UNIT, HUMANITAS CLINICAL AND RESEARCH CENTER, SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH, HOSPITALIZATION AND HEALTHCARE (IRCCS), ROZZANO, MILAN, ITALY.; DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES, HUMANITAS UNIVERSITY, PIEVE EMANUELE, MILAN, ITALY.; OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY UNIT, HUMANITAS CLINICAL AND RESEARCH CENTER, SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH, HOSPITALIZATION AND HEALTHCARE (IRCCS), ROZZANO, MILAN, ITALY.; OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY UNIT, HUMANITAS CLINICAL AND RESEARCH CENTER, SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH, HOSPITALIZATION AND HEALTHCARE (IRCCS), ROZZANO, MILAN, ITALY.; DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES, HUMANITAS UNIVERSITY, PIEVE EMANUELE, MILAN, ITALY.; OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY UNIT, HUMANITAS CLINICAL AND RESEARCH CENTER, SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH, HOSPITALIZATION AND HEALTHCARE (IRCCS), ROZZANO, MILAN, ITALY.; DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES, HUMANITAS UNIVERSITY, PIEVE EMANUELE, MILAN, ITALY.; OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY UNIT, HUMANITAS CLINICAL AND RESEARCH CENTER, SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH, HOSPITALIZATION AND HEALTHCARE (IRCCS), ROZZANO, MILAN, ITALY.; DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES, HUMANITAS UNIVERSITY, PIEVE EMANUELE, MILAN, ITALY.; OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY UNIT, HUMANITAS CLINICAL AND RESEARCH CENTER, SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH, HOSPITALIZATION AND HEALTHCARE (IRCCS), ROZZANO, MILAN, ITALY.; DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES, HUMANITAS UNIVERSITY, PIEVE EMANUELE, MILAN, ITALY.; OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY UNIT, HUMANITAS CLINICAL AND RESEARCH CENTER, SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH, HOSPITALIZATION AND HEALTHCARE (IRCCS), ROZZANO, MILAN, ITALY.; DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES, HUMANITAS UNIVERSITY, PIEVE EMANUELE, MILAN, ITALY.; OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY UNIT, HUMANITAS CLINICAL AND RESEARCH CENTER, SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH, HOSPITALIZATION AND HEALTHCARE (IRCCS), ROZZANO, MILAN, ITALY.; OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY UNIT, HUMANITAS CLINICAL AND RESEARCH CENTER, SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH, HOSPITALIZATION AND HEALTHCARE (IRCCS), ROZZANO, MILAN, ITALY.; OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY UNIT, HUMANITAS CLINICAL AND RESEARCH CENTER, SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH, HOSPITALIZATION AND HEALTHCARE (IRCCS), ROZZANO, MILAN, ITALY.; BIOSTATISTICS UNIT, HUMANITAS CLINICAL AND RESEARCH CENTER, IRCCS, ROZZANO, MILAN, ITALY.; DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES, HUMANITAS UNIVERSITY, PIEVE EMANUELE, MILAN, ITALY.; CLINICAL QUALITY DEPARTMENT, HUMANITAS CLINICAL AND RESEARCH CENTER, IRCCS, ROZZANO, MILAN, ITALY.; CLINICAL QUALITY DEPARTMENT, HUMANITAS CLINICAL AND RESEARCH CENTER, IRCCS, ROZZANO, MILAN, ITALY.; DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES, HUMANITAS UNIVERSITY, PIEVE EMANUELE, MILAN, ITALY.; OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY UNIT, HUMANITAS CLINICAL AND RESEARCH CENTER, SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH, HOSPITALIZATION AND HEALTHCARE (IRCCS), ROZZANO, MILAN, ITALY.;",NA,NA,"DOI: 10.1001/JAMA.2020.10966",NA,"CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES: NONE REPORTED.","2020/06/20 06:00","20210517",NA,2020,"2020/06/20 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"8",NA,"2168-619X (ELECTRONIC) 2168-6181 (PRINT) 2168-6181 (LINKING)","101589542","JAMA OTOLARYNGOLOGY-- HEAD & NECK SURGERY","ENG","10.1001/JAMAOTO.2020.1155 [DOI]","20210619","2021/05/18 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","723-728",NA,"PMC7303892",NA,"32556070","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"JAMA OTOLARYNGOL HEAD NECK SURG. 2020 AUG 1;146(8):723-728.

PATIENTS PARTICIPATING IN THE STUDY WERE DIVIDED INTO 2 GROUPS; GROUP 1: CLASSIC SEPTOPLASTY (N: 25) AND GROUP 2: EXTRACORPOREAL SEPTOPLASTY (N: 14). THE SINONASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22), PEAK NASAL FLOWMETRY, AND CONNECTICUT CHEMOSENSORY CLINICAL RESEARCH CENTER TEST WERE APPLIED TO ALL PATIENTS BEFORE AND 8 WEEKS AFTER SURGERY. SURGICAL OUTCOMES ALSO ASSESSED TO EVALUATE COMPLICATIONS 6 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY. RESULT: IN TOTAL, 39 (27 MALES, 12 FEMALES) PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH NASAL SEPTUM DEVIATION WERE INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY. A SEPTOPLASTY WAS PERFORMED IN ALL PATIENTS: 25 OF THEM (18 MALES, 7 FEMALES; MEAN AGE = 29.4 [RANGE, 23-50] YEARS) UNDERWENT CLASSIC SEPTOPLASTIES AND 14 (9 MALES, 5 FEMALES; MEAN AGE = 31.3 [RANGE, 23-50] YEARS) UNDERWENT EXTRACORPOREAL SEPTOPLASTIES.

METHODOLOGY: PROSPECTIVE CLINICAL TRIAL INCLUDING 116 PATIENTS FROM A TERTIARY CARE CENTER AT HIGH-RISK OF DISEASE RECURRENCE FOLLOWING ESS+BUD. BLOOD SAMPLES, MICROBIAL SWABS, AND SNSS/SNOT-22 WERE TAKEN ON THE DAY OF SURGERY (VISIT-1) AND 4 MONTHS POSTOPERATIVELY (VISIT-2). OUTCOMES WERE EVALUATED USING SYMPTOMS AND MUCOSAL STATUS AS ASSESSED BY THE LUND-KENNEDY ENDOSCOPIC SCORE. RESULTS: SEVENTY-FIVE PATIENTS (69.4%) ATTAINED SNOT-22 MCID OR HIGHER. (MEAN = 33.4, RANGE 9-75). OBJECTIVE DOCUMENTATION OF RECURRENCE OF DISEASE, AS DEFINED BY COMBINED ENDOSCOPIC/SYMPTOMATIC CRITERIA, WAS NOTED IN 58/116 PATIENTS (50%). REVISION SURGERY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RATE OF DISEASE RECURRENCE (60.0 VS. 28.0%; P < 0.001). CULTURE FOR STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE RECURRENCE, PREOPERATIVELY AND AT 4 MONTHS POST-SURGERY (P = 0.020; P < 0.001). THIS WAS RESTRICTED TO POST-OPERATIVE CULTURES IN THE REVISION GROUP (10.0 VS. 48.8%; P < 0.001). OTHER FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH POOR OUTCOME INCLUDED INTOLERANCE TO NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAID) (P = 0.036). SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER LUND-KENNEDY SCORES IN THE RECURRENCE GROUPS DESPITE SIMILAR SYMPTOM INTENSITY, EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSIDERING OBJECTIVE OUTCOME IN ADDITION TO PATIENT-REPORTED ONES. CONCLUSION: PATIENTS UNDERGOING REVISION ESS ARE AT HIGH RISK OF DISEASE RECURRENCE, EVEN WHEN BUDESONIDE IRRIGATIONS ARE USED POST OPERATIVELY. PRESENCE OF S. AUREUS ON CULTURE PRE-OPERATIVELY OR AT 4 MONTHS POST-ESS IS ASSOCIATED WITH A NEGATIVE OUTCOME. THIS SUGGESTS THAT S. AUREUS NEGATIVELY INFLUENCES OUTCOME, POSSIBLY VIA A NUMBER OF MECHANISMS, INCLUDING INTERACTIONS WITH THE (I) IMMUNE SYSTEM, (II) REGENERATION AND REPAIR OF THE SINUS EPITHELIUM, OR (III) VIA INTERFERENCE WITH THE SINUS MICROBIOME. THIS SUGGESTS THAT S. AUREUS MAY BE A SIMPLE AND INEXPENSIVE BIOMARKER FOR DISEASE SEVERITY AND INDICATES A CLEAR NEED TO BETTER APPRECIATE S. AUREUS ON HOW IT CONTRIBUTES MECHANISTICALLY TO DISEASE DEVELOPMENT AND PERSISTENCE IN ORDER TO DEVELOP TARGETED THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES.","CENTRE DE RECHERCHE DU CENTRE HOSPITALIER DE L'UNIVERSITÉ DE MONTRÉAL, MONTREAL, QC, CANADA.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, CENTRE HOSPITALIER DE L'UNIVERSITÉ DE MONTRÉAL, MONTREAL, QC, CANADA.; CENTRE DE RECHERCHE DU CENTRE HOSPITALIER DE L'UNIVERSITÉ DE MONTRÉAL, MONTREAL, QC, CANADA.; CENTRE DE RECHERCHE DU CENTRE HOSPITALIER DE L'UNIVERSITÉ DE MONTRÉAL, MONTREAL, QC, CANADA.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, MCMASTER UNIVERSITY, HAMILTON, ON, CANADA.; DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY, CAMBRIDGE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, CAMBRIDGE, ON, CANADA.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, CENTRE HOSPITALIER DE L'UNIVERSITÉ DE MONTRÉAL, MONTREAL, QC, CANADA.; FACULTY OF MEDICINE, KING SAUD UNIVERSITY, RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA.; CENTRE DE RECHERCHE DU CENTRE HOSPITALIER DE L'UNIVERSITÉ DE MONTRÉAL, MONTREAL, QC, CANADA.; CENTRE DE RECHERCHE DU CENTRE HOSPITALIER DE L'UNIVERSITÉ DE MONTRÉAL, MONTREAL, QC, CANADA.; DIVISION OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, CENTRE HOSPITALIER DE L'UNIVERSITÉ DE MONTRÉAL, MONTREAL, QC, CANADA.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2018/06/06 06:00","20190520","20180515",2018,"2018/06/06 06:00",NA,NA,"CIHR/CANADA",NA,NA,"2235-2988 (ELECTRONIC) 2235-2988 (LINKING)","101585359","FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY","ENG","10.3389/FCIMB.2018.00150 [DOI] 150","20190520","2019/05/21 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","150",NA,"PMC5962714",NA,"29868506","EPUBLISH","51333-22-3 (BUDESONIDE)","IM",NA,"FRONT CELL INFECT MICROBIOL. 2018 MAY 15;8:150.

AIM OF THE STUDY: WE DEVELOPED A LICORICE EXTRACT (LE) BY USING GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA AND ADMINISTERED IT THROUGH NASAL IRRIGATION TO TREAT ALLERGIC RHINITIS (AR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: LE WAS PREPARED INTO EXTRACT POWDER, AND THE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECT OF THE LE WAS EVALUATED BY CALCIUM IONOPHORE-INDUCED ACTIVATED MAST CELL MODEL (IN VITRO). THEN, LOCAL PASSIVE ANAPHYLAXIS ASSAYS WERE APPLIED TO INVESTIGATE THE ANTI-IGE-MEDIATED ALLERGIC REACTION OF THE LE IN MICE (IN VIVO). A DEVELOPED LE WAS ADMINISTERED THROUGH NASAL IRRIGATION TO TREAT AR IN CLINIC SETTINGS. A TOTAL OF 60 PARTICIPANTS DIAGNOSED WITH AR WERE INCLUDED IN THIS CLINICAL TRIAL; THEY WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO THREE INTERVENTIONS: LICORICE NASAL IRRIGATION (LNI), CORTICOSTEROID NASAL IRRIGATION (CNI), AND SALINE NASAL IRRIGATION (SNI). THEY PERFORMED NASAL IRRIGATION ONCE A DAY FOR 1 MONTH. BOTH SUBJECTIVE QUESTIONNAIRES (22-ITEM SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST [SNOT-22] AND VISUAL ANALOG SCALE [VAS]) AND OBJECTIVE EXAMINATIONS (ACOUSTIC RHINOMETRY AND NASAL ENDOSCOPY) WERE USED FOR EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENTS. RESULTS: ALL THREE INTERVENTIONS COULD IMPROVE SNOT-22 SCORES, BUT THE EFFECTS OF LNI AND CNI WERE MORE SIGNIFICANT. ACCORDING TO VAS SCORES FOR NASAL BLOCKAGE, RHINORRHEA, SNEEZING, NASAL PRURITUS, POSTNASAL DISCHARGE, AND OLFACTORY DISTURBANCE, THE EFFECT OF LNI WAS SUPERIOR TO THOSE OF CNI AND SNI. THE RESULTS OF RHINOMETRY REVEALED THAT LNI SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED NASAL RESISTANCE. ENDOSCOPIC ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT BOTH LNI AND CNI, BUT NOT SNI, COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE TURBINATE HYPERTROPHY. MOREOVER, THE BEST PROCEDURAL COMFORT WAS FOUND FOR LNI, WHICH HAD NO SIDE EFFECTS OR COMPLICATIONS DURING THE TRIAL. CONCLUSIONS: LNI IS A NATURAL, SAFE, AND INNOVATIVE THERAPY THAT CAN EFFECTIVELY TREAT AR. ITS EFFECT IS SUPERIOR TO THOSE OF CNI AND SNI, AND IT HAS GREATLY IMPROVED PROCEDURAL COMFORT.","DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, CHANG GUNG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, CHIAYI, TAIWAN; GRADUATE INSTITUTE OF CLINICAL MEDICAL SCIENCES, COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, CHANG GUNG UNIVERSITY, TAIWAN; HEALTH INFORMATION AND EPIDEMIOLOGY LABORATORY OF CHANG GUNG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, CHIA-YI 61363, TAIWAN; FACULTY OF MEDICINE, COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, CHANG GUNG UNIVERSITY, TAOYUAN, TAIWAN.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: GENGHECHANG@GMAIL.;COM.; DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACY, CHIAYI CHANG GUNG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, CHIAYI, TAIWAN.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: YOHIMBA@CGMH.;ORG.;TW.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, CHANG GUNG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, CHIAYI, TAIWAN.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: A2828282828A@GMAIL.;COM.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, CHANG GUNG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, CHIAYI, TAIWAN.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: A8890927@GMAIL.;COM.; DEPARTMENT OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE, CHANG GUNG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, CHIAYI, TAIWAN; SCHOOL OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE, COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, CHANG GUNG UNIVERSITY, TAOYUAN, TAIWAN.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: U9302702@CMU.;EDU.;TW.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, CHANG GUNG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, CHIAYI, TAIWAN; GRADUATE INSTITUTE OF CLINICAL MEDICAL SCIENCES, COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, CHANG GUNG UNIVERSITY, TAIWAN; HEALTH INFORMATION AND EPIDEMIOLOGY LABORATORY OF CHANG GUNG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, CHIA-YI 61363, TAIWAN; FACULTY OF MEDICINE, COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, CHANG GUNG UNIVERSITY, TAOYUAN, TAIWAN.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: B87401061@CGMH.;ORG.;TW.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, CHANG GUNG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, CHIAYI, TAIWAN.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: YAOTE1215@GMAIL.;COM.; DEPARTMENT OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY, CHANG GUNG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, CHIAYI, TAIWAN; FACULTY OF MEDICINE, COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, CHANG GUNG UNIVERSITY, TAOYUAN, TAIWAN.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: SCM00031@GMAIL.;COM.; GRADUATE INSTITUTE OF CLINICAL MEDICAL SCIENCES, COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, CHANG GUNG UNIVERSITY, TAIWAN.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: PEYJIUMC@MAIL.;CGU.;EDU.;TW.; GRADUATE INSTITUTE OF CLINICAL MEDICAL SCIENCES, COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, CHANG GUNG UNIVERSITY, TAIWAN.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: CSSHI@MAIL.;CGU.;EDU.;TW.; HEALTH INFORMATION AND EPIDEMIOLOGY LABORATORY OF CHANG GUNG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, CHIA-YI 61363, TAIWAN; DEPARTMENT OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE, CHANG GUNG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, CHIAYI, TAIWAN; SCHOOL OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE, COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, CHANG GUNG UNIVERSITY, TAOYUAN, TAIWAN.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: R95841012@NTU.;EDU.;TW.; DEPARTMENT OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE, CHANG GUNG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, CHIAYI, TAIWAN; SCHOOL OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE, COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, CHANG GUNG UNIVERSITY, TAOYUAN, TAIWAN.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: CHINGYUANWUMD@GMAIL.;COM.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT © 2021 THE AUTHORS.

OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO EVALUATE OUTCOMES OF A STRATEGY USING MUCOSAL GRAFTS TO DECREASE POSTOPERATIVE CLOSURE. STUDY DESIGN: PROSPECTIVE COHORT. SETTING: TERTIARY CARE FACILITY. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: PATIENTS REQUIRING A DRAF III PROCEDURE WERE PROSPECTIVELY ENROLLED IN THE STUDY. DEMOGRAPHICS, REASON FOR THE PROCEDURE, PERCENTAGE GRAFT VIABILITY, AND COMPLICATIONS WERE RECORDED. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS ANTERIOR-POSTERIOR (AP) DIAMETER AT 3 MONTHS. RESULTS: MUCOSAL GRAFTING WAS PERFORMED DURING 29 DRAF III PROCEDURES FROM 2008 TO 2011. TWENTY-SEVEN PATIENTS (AVERAGE AGE, 58 YEARS) WERE AVAILABLE FOR MEASUREMENT AT 3 MONTHS (AVERAGE POSTOPERATIVE FOLLOW-UP, 15.4 MONTHS; RANGE, 3-30 MONTHS). REASONS FOR THE PROCEDURE INCLUDED TUMOR (N = 14), CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS (CRS) WITH FRONTAL OSTIUM STENOSIS (N = 12), AND TRAUMA (N = 1). AVERAGE INTRAOPERATIVE AP DIAMETER WAS 11.7 MM. ALL PATIENTS MET THE DEFINITION OF SUCCESS (<50% REDUCTION IN DIAMETER), MAINTAINING A PATENT COMBINED FRONTAL SINUS OSTIUM FOR THE DURATION OF FOLLOW-UP (AVERAGE DIAMETER 10.8 MM AT 3 MONTHS). NINE PATIENTS WITH CRS AND FRONTAL OSTIUM STENOSIS HAD OPENINGS SIMILAR TO THE ENTIRE COHORT (>1-YEAR FOLLOW-UP; AVERAGE, 19.3 MONTHS) WITH SIGNIFICANT SYMPTOM REDUCTION (SNOT-22 PREOP 62.3 ± 20.8 VS 3 MONTHS 27.8 ± 14.8 AND 1 YEAR 21.4 ± 13.6; P < .0001). CONCLUSION: CICATRICIAL STENOSIS AND OSTEONEOGENESIS ARE COMMON FOLLOWING THE DRAF III PROCEDURE.

OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS THE CLINICAL OUTCOMES AND QUALITY OF LIFE RESULTS OF ENDOSCOPIC VERSUS TNTS SEPTOPLASTY IN PATIENTS WITH SEPTAL DEVIATION AND NASAL OBSTRUCTION. DESIGN: A PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING 2 APPROACHES OF SEPTOPLASTY: ENDOSCOPIC AND TNTS SEPTOPLASTY PERFORMED IN A SINGLE INSTITUTION DURING THE YEARS 2016 TO2017. THE FOLLOW-UP TIME WAS 3 MONTHS. SETTING: A SINGLE INSTITUTION STUDY IN A TERTIARY HEALTH-CARE REFERRAL CENTER. PARTICIPANTS: PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT PRIMARY SURGERY FOR REPAIRING DEVIATED NASAL SEPTUM DUE TO NASAL OBSTRUCTION, WERE OLDER THAN 18 YEARS OLD, AND WERE ELIGIBLE FOR STUDY INCLUSION. SIXTY-FIVE PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED IN THIS STUDY, 34 IN THE ENDOSCOPIC ARM AND 31 IN THE TNTS SEPTOPLASTY ARM. THE OVERALL FOLLOW-UP RATE WAS 94% AT THE FIRST VISIT (2 WEEKS) AND 92% AT THE LAST VISIT (12 WEEKS). THUS, THE FINAL COHORT CONSISTED OF 60 PATIENTS, 30 IN EACH STUDY ARM. THE PATIENTS RANGED IN AGE FROM 18 TO 71 YEARS (MEAN 27 YEARS) OLD. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS THE SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 (SNOT-22) SCORE. SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE THE SHORT FORM 36 (SF36) QOL SCORE AND COMPLICATION RATES. BOTH QUESTIONNAIRES WERE ADMINISTERED AT 2 WEEKS AND 3 MONTHS FOLLOWING SURGERY. RESULTS: SIXTY PATIENTS COMPLETED THIS STUDY, 30 IN EACH STUDY ARM. SINO-NASAL OUTCOME TEST-22 SCORES WERE IMPROVED AFTER 3 MONTHS, WITH NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE STUDY ARMS. THERE WERE NO CASES OF SEPTAL PERFORATION OR PROFOUND BLEEDING REQUIRING REPEATED SURGERY. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: ENDOSCOPIC SEPTOPLASTY AND TNTS SHOW SIMILAR RESULTS FOR TREATMENT OF NASAL SEPTUM DEVIATION.

OUR STUDY AIMED AT VERIFYING THIS HYPOTHESIS IN AN ITALIAN CRS POPULATION. IN 457 CRS PATIENTS TREATED WITH ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY AFTER FAILURE OF MAXIMAL MEDICAL THERAPY, THE PERCENTAGE OF ACHIEVING A MINIMAL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE (MCID) AND THE PERCENTAGE OF RELATIVE IMPROVEMENT AFTER SURGERY WERE CALCULATED. MOREOVER, THE IMPACT OF SEVERAL FACTORS ON PREOPERATIVE AND POSTOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORE WAS INVESTIGATED. SYMPTOM IMPROVEMENT OCCURRED IN THE MAJORITY OF PATIENTS AND WAS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO BASELINE SNOT-22. 79,7% OF PATIENTS ACHIEVED THE MCID AND THE PERCENTAGE OF RELATIVE IMPROVEMENT WAS 50,1%. PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL-FUNCTIONING IMPLICATIONS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED SNOT-22 SCORES. MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT HISTORY OF PREVIOUS SURGERY, ASTHMA, PREOPERATIVE ENDOSCOPIC AND SNOT-22 SCORES PREDICTED THE POSTOPERATIVE SNOT-22 SCORE (R2 = 0,298).

THIS IS A PROSPECTIVE DOUBLE-BLIND, CONTROLLED STUDY. A TOTAL OF 106 PATIENTS WITH AR, WHO REJECTED ANTI-ALLERGIC THERAPY, WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: G (STUDY GROUP, N = 53) RECEIVED LIPOSOMAL NASAL SPRAY AND C (CONTROL GROUP, N = 53) RECEIVED 0.9% SODIUM CHLORIDE SOLUTION NASAL SPRAY. BOTH NASAL SPRAYS WERE APPLIED TWO TIMES A DAY, IN THE MORNING AND AT NIGHT, IN BOTH NASAL CAVITIES. THE STUDY LASTED FOR 30 DAYS. THE FIRST ENT EVALUATION WAS PERFORMED THE FIRST DAY (T0) AND THE SECOND EVALUATION WAS PERFORMED AT THE END OF THE STUDY (T1). SYMPTOMS (SNOT-22 TEST WITH VAS) AND SIGNS (NASAL CYTOLOGY) OF BOTH GROUPS WERE RECORDED AT T0 AND T1. LIPOSOMAL NASAL SPRAY WAS EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING BOTH NASAL SYMPTOMS AND CYTOLOGY IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM PERENNIAL AR. TREATMENT WITH LIPOSOMAL NASAL SPRAY WITH VITAMINS A AND E WAS FOLLOWED BY A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OF VAS SCALE (P < 0.0001), A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN SNOT-22 (P < 0.0001) AND A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN INFLAMMATORY CELL COUNT (P < 0.0001). IN CONCLUSION, OUR STUDY PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT LIPOSOMAL NASAL SPRAY IMPROVES THE NASAL SYMPTOMS OF AR. THE PATIENTS WERE COMPLIANT TO THIS THERAPY BECAUSE OF LIMITED SIDE EFFECTS. THE REDUCTION IN INFLAMMATORY CELLS COUNT WAS REMARKABLE AND CONFIRMED THE CLOSE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN EOSINOPHIL INFILTRATION AND NASAL AIRFLOW IMPAIRMENT. THESE RESULTS MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE.","ENG","NOTNLM","NLM","217-223",NA,"PMC7416366",NA,"32773784","PPUBLISH","0 (AEROSOLS) 0 (LIPOSOMES) 0 (NASAL SPRAYS) 11103-57-4 (VITAMIN A) 1406-18-4 (VITAMIN E)","IM",NA,"ACTA OTORHINOLARYNGOL ITAL. 2020 JUN;40(3):217-223.
