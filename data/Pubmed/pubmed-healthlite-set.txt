AB  - Evidence of a social gradient in health literacy has been found in all reported 
      national population surveys. Health literacy is a midstream determinant of health 
      but not a panacea for addressing health inequities created by the maldistribution of 
      opportunity and resources. It is possible to optimize the contribution health 
      literacy makes in mediating the causes and effects of established social 
      determinants of health. Existing interventions demonstrate the feasibility of 
      improving health literacy among higher-risk populations, but research remains 
      underdeveloped and effects on health inequity are largely untested. Future health 
      literacy intervention research should focus on (a) improving the quality of health 
      communication that reaches a diversity of populations, especially by improving 
      frontline professional skills and support; (b) enabling people to develop 
      transferable skills in accessing, understanding, analyzing, and applying health 
      information; and (c) ensuring that priority is proportionate to need by reaching and 
      engaging the population groups who are disproportionately affected by low health 
      literacy.

TI  - Health Literacy Interventions in Cancer: a Systematic Review.
PG  - 240-252

AB  - Approximately one-third of adults in the United States (U.S.) have limited health 
      literacy. Those with limited health literacy often have difficultly navigating the 
      health care environment, including navigating care across the cancer continuum 
      (e.g., prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment). Evidence-based interventions to 
      assist adults with limited health literacy improve health outcomes; however, little 
      is known about health literacy interventions in the context of cancer and their 
      impact on cancer-specific health outcomes. The purpose of this review was to 
      identify and characterize the literature on health literacy interventions across the 
      cancer care continuum. Specifically, our aim was to review the strength of evidence, 
      outcomes assessed, and intervention modalities within the existing literature 
      reporting health literacy interventions in cancer. Our search yielded 1036 records 
      (prevention/screening n = 174; diagnosis/treatment n = 862). Following deduplication 
      and review for inclusion criteria, we analyzed 87 records of intervention studies 
      reporting health literacy outcomes, including 45 pilot studies (prevention/screening 
      n = 24; diagnosis/treatment n = 21) and 42 randomized controlled trials or 
      quasi-experimental trials (prevention/screening n = 31; diagnosis/treatment n = 11). 
      This literature included 36 unique interventions (prevention/screening n = 28; 
      diagnosis/treatment n = 8), mostly in the formative stages of intervention 
      development, with few assessments of evidence-based interventions. These gaps in the 
      literature necessitate further research in the development and implementation of 
      evidence-based health literacy interventions to improve cancer outcomes.

TI  - Health literacy in cancer caregivers: a systematic review.
PG  - 825-836
LID - 10.1007/s11764-020-00975-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Cancer caregivers play a vital role in the care and health decision-making 
      of cancer survivors. Consequently, their health literacy levels may be particularly 
      important, as low levels may impede adequate care provision. As such, the current 
      review aimed to systematically examine the literature on health literacy amongst 
      cancer caregivers. METHODS: We systematically searched the following databases using 
      controlled vocabulary and free-text terms: PsychINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and 
      Web of Science. Peer-reviewed empirical studies that explicitly measured and 
      reported cancer caregiver health literacy levels were included. RESULTS: The search 
      yielded six articles consisting of 593 cancer caregivers exploring health literacy 
      and eHealth literacy. There was substantial variation in health literacy measurement 
      tools used across included studies, precluding the possibility of conducting a 
      meta-analysis. The included articles reported significant associations (limited to 
      single studies) between caregiver health/eHealth literacy and (i) cancer survivor 
      demographics, (ii) caregivers' communication style, (iii) caregiver Internet access 
      and (iv) caregiver coping strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight a need for 
      future longitudinal research regarding cancer caregiver health literacy 
      incorporating more standardized and population-specific measurement approaches. In 
      particular, there is a pressing need to investigate factors associated with cancer 
      caregiver health literacy to inform the development/delivery of future 
      interventions. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Future high-quality research which 
      investigates the factors which contribute towards sub-optimal health literacy 
      amongst cancer caregivers would aid in the development of appropriate and effective 
      health literacy interventions in these groups. Such interventions would allow this 
      important group to provide appropriate support to cancer survivors and enhance 
      survivors' engagement in their health and wellbeing.

AB  - From the individual viewpoint, active aging refers to the ability of older persons, 
      depending on their goals, functional capacity and opportunities, to engage in 
      desired activities. This study investigated the role of health literacy in active 
      aging among persons differing in their number of chronic conditions. Data were 
      collected from 948 individuals, 57% women, aged 75, 80 and 85 in 2017-2018 in the 
      city of Jyväskylä in Central Finland. Health literacy was assessed with the 
      16-question version of the European Health Literacy Survey (HLS-EU-Q16), active 
      aging with the University of Jyväskylä Active Aging Scale (UJACAS) and self-reported 
      physician-diagnosed chronic conditions. Both health literacy (r = 0.40) and number 
      of chronic conditions (r = -0.21) correlated with the active aging score. Linear 
      regression models revealed that health literacy was a stronger predictor than 
      chronic conditions of active aging (β 0.18, p < 0.001 vs. β -0.06, p = 0.030) and 
      that its predictive value remained statistically significant after adjustment for 
      cognitive capacity, number of depressive symptoms, physical performance and length 
      of education. Higher health literacy can enable older persons, including those with 
      multiple chronic conditions, to maintain higher levels of active aging. As more 
      people are projected to live with chronic conditions to older ages, health literacy 
      may help them to cope with illnesses and functional limitations and lead a 
      fulfilling life. These cross-sectional findings lay a foundation for future 
      prospective and experimental studies on health literacy and active aging.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether health literacy is associated with: 1) degree of 
      hearing loss at initial presentation for audiogram and 2) hearing aid adoption for 
      hearing aid candidates. METHODS: We identified 1376 patients who underwent 
      audiometric testing and completed a brief health literacy questionnaire at our 
      institution. The association between health literacy and degree of hearing loss at 
      initial presentation was examined using linear regression, adjusted for age, gender, 
      marital status, education level, race, language, employment status, and insurance 
      coverage. The association between health literacy and hearing aid adoption was 
      examined in the subset of patients identified as hearing aid candidates using 
      logistic regression, adjusted for demographic factors and insurance coverage. 
      RESULTS: Patients with inadequate health literacy were more likely to present with 
      more severe hearing loss (adjusted mean pure-tone average [PTA] difference, 5.38 dB, 
      95% confidence interval [CI] 2.75 to 8.01). For hearing aid candidates (n = 472 
      [41.6%]), health literacy was not associated with hearing aid adoption rate (odds 
      ratio [OR] 0.85, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.76). Hearing aid coverage through Medicaid (OR 
      2.22, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.37), and moderate (OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.58 to 4.69) or 
      moderate-severe (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.19 to 4.16) hearing loss were associated with 
      hearing aid adoption. CONCLUSIONS: In our population, patients with low health 
      literacy are more likely to present with higher degrees of hearing loss, but no less 
      likely to obtain hearing aids compared with patients with adequate health literacy. 
      Hearing loss severity and hearing aid coverage by insurance appear to be the main 
      drivers of hearing aid adoption. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 Laryngoscope, 131:E1688-E1694,

AB  - INTRODUCTION: As health outcomes and disparities become more important in national 
      healthcare, physicians must be aware of every patient's health literacy in order to 
      deliver effective care. Our goal was to measure the health literacy rates in the 
      caregivers of our pediatric tracheostomy population. These caregivers specifically 
      have an immense responsibility that requires a certain capacity for understanding 
      and learning complex skills. Thus far there have been no studies or surveys 
      investigating the rates of health literacy in this population or tracheostomy 
      patients in general. Caregivers' literacy rates were measured by administering a 
      Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA). This test uses actual 
      materials that patients might encounter in a typical clinic and consists of a 
      reading comprehension and numeracy section. To assess impact of the complex care on 
      caregiver quality of life, we simultaneously administered the Pediatric Tracheostomy 
      Health Status Instrument (PTHSI), a validated caregiver quality of life measurement. 
      METHODS: Caregivers of children with tracheostomies were recruited and surveyed 
      during the Pediatric Tracheostomy Clinic between July 2019-October 2019. Twenty - 
      six caregivers completed the TOFHLA; 24 completed all three parts - the TOFHLA, the 
      demographic survey, and the PTHSI. RESULTS: Health literacy rates among patient 
      families in the out-patient setting with experience with tracheostomy were deemed 
      "adequate" in 85% of caregivers; the remaining 15% of caregivers scored 
      "inadequate". Overall adult literacy rates in the general population in this state 
      are 26% "inadequate." Approximately 80% of our caregivers rely solely on Medicaid 
      for healthcare insurance and nearly half of participants reported an annual 
      household income less than $5000. Ages of caregivers ranged from 20 to 61 years, 
      with no significant correlation to health literacy. The average PTHSI score was 36 
      (SD 8.6), denoting a moderate level of caregiver burden but no correlation to the 
      caregiver health literacy score was found. When comparing caregiver health literacy 
      scores in relation to education level, caregivers with college and post-graduate 
      education had higher literacy scores than those with a high school education, 
      p = .0086. In addition, when comparing African American to white caregivers, white 
      caregivers were found to have higher health literacy scores, p = .036. Notably, 
      caregiver burden as measured by the PTHSI score did not differ significantly between 
      caregivers in lower income and higher income levels, p = .91. CONCLUSION: Health 
      literacy measurements for caregivers of children with complex medical conditions 
      exceed the health literacy rates of the general population in our state, potentially 
      biased by the intensive training provided to families during their prolonged 
      hospitalization. Healthcare disparities may impact the medically complex child 
      differently from the healthy child. Assumptions about health, wealth and caregiver 
      burden may be inaccurate and warrant further evaluation. Assessing health literacy 
      before institutionalization has occurred may enable us to more accurately design 
      caregiver training programs to further augment literacy and health literacy.

TI  - Health Literacy: An Interactive Outcome Among Secondary Students in Beijing.
PG  - e1-e14

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health literacy enables a person to make good decisions regarding health 
      care, disease prevention, and health promotion to maintain and improve health. 
      Although health literacy research in China has gained increasing attention in recent 
      years, most existing studies focus on adults rather than adolescents. In addition, 
      little theory-driven empirical research has been conducted to fully understand the 
      relationship among health literacy, its influencing factors, and health outcomes 
      scored on a skills-based health literacy instrument. OBJECTIVE: This study applied 
      Manganello's framework to investigate how health literacy was related to its 
      antecedents and health status in secondary students in Beijing, China. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional study was conducted with 650 students in Years 7 to 9 (age 11-17 
      years) from four secondary schools. Students completed a self-administered 
      questionnaire based on Manganello's health literacy framework, which measured key 
      upstream determinants, including health literacy and self-report health status. 
      Health literacy was measured on an 8-item skills-based instrument that assesses a 
      person's ability to find, understand, appraise, and communicate health information 
      in everyday life (scores range from 0-37). Descriptive statistics and path analysis 
      were conducted to investigate the mediating role of health literacy in predicting 
      health status. KEY RESULTS: Overall, the average scores of students' health literacy 
      was 26.37 (±5.89). Manganello's framework was supported by the data collected 
      (χ(2)/df = 2.049, p = .001, comparative fix index = 0.966, root mean square error of 
      approximation = 0.041). Personal self-efficacy (r = 0.11, p = .007), social support 
      (r = 0.18, p < .001), and school environment (r = 0.27, p < .001) predicted health 
      literacy, which in turn predicted students' health status (r = 0.12, p = .005). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent health literacy is not only a person's capability to protect 
      health, but also an interactive outcome with the broader environment. Promoting 
      health literacy could be a useful strategy to improve health status for adolescents; 
      however, a holistic approach is needed to increase students' self-efficacy, promote 
      social support, and create positive school environments to achieve optimal health 
      literacy and health outcomes. [HLRP: Health Literacy Research and Practice. 
      2021;5(1):e1-e14.] PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: We investigated how health literacy was 
      related to its influencing factors and health status among secondary students in 
      Years 7 to 9 in Beijing, China. Students with low self-efficacy, low social support, 
      and low perceptions of positive school environment were more likely to have low 
      health literacy, which in turn predicted poor health status.

LID - 10.1093/heapro/daaa029 [doi]
AB  - Health literacy is individuals' motivation and ability to obtain, understand, 
      evaluate and use health information. Health literacy is very important during 
      university education when students have the ability to acquire and accumulate 
      knowledge of the best way. The aim of this study was to determine the health 
      literacy of university students. The sample of this descriptive cross-sectional 
      study was composed of 365 students who were first-time visitors at the health center 
      of a private university in Northern Cyprus between May and July 2017. An 
      introductory information form and the Adult Health Literacy Scale (AHLS) were used 
      as data collection tools. The mean AHLS score of the students was found as 
      13.91 ± 2.90. Health literacy was found to be lower for male students and students 
      with more years of study. The students with low daily alcohol use had higher AHLS 
      scores. The results of the study suggest that curricula should be revised to raise 
      the health literacy of university students to the highest level. It is important to 
      organize conferences, seminars and scientific activities to improving the health 
      literacy of male students and students with more years of study. Due to the 
      limitations of studies of health literacy in North Cyprus, future studies should be 
      conducted with larger samples and different measurement tools.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Health literacy affects how patients behave within the healthcare 
      system. Overutilization of screening procedures inconsistent with the U.S. 
      Preventive Services Task Force guidelines contributes to the high cost of health 
      care. The authors hypothesize that higher health literacy supports 
      guideline-concordant screening. This study assesses the effect of health literacy on 
      nonrecommended prostate, breast, and cervical cancer screening in patients older 
      than the recommended screening age limit. METHODS: The 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor 
      Surveillance System included health literacy modules. Respondents self-reported 
      their ability to obtain and understand health information, resulting in 4 health 
      literacy rankings. The authors calculated the population-weighted proportion of 
      respondents in each health literacy category who underwent screening past the Task 
      Force‒recommended age limit. The ORs of nonrecommended screening for each malignancy 
      were calculated, with low health literacy as the ref category. RESULTS: Individuals 
      with higher health literacy underwent more nonrecommended screening. Nonrecommended 
      prostate cancer screening was performed in 27.4% (95% CI=23.7%, 31.4%) and 47.7% 
      (95% CI=44.1%, 51.3%) of respondents with low and high health literacy, respectively 
      (p<0.001). Nonrecommended breast cancer screening was performed in 46.8% (95% 
      CI=42.6%, 51.1%) and 67.7% (95% CI=64.2%, 71.1%) of respondents with low and high 
      health literacy, respectively (p=0.002). Nonrecommended cervical cancer screening 
      was performed in 33.8% (95% CI=31.1%, 36.5%) and 48.4% (95% CI=46.3%, 50.5%) of 
      respondents with low and high health literacy, respectively (p<0.001). Individuals 
      with high health literacy were significantly more likely than those with low health 
      literacy to screen against the recommendations for prostate (OR=1.73, 95% CI=1.34, 
      2.23, p<0.001), cervical (OR=1.533, 95% CI=1.31, 1.80, p<0.001), and breast 
      (OR=8.213, 95% CI=4.90, 13.76, p<0.001) cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Higher health literacy 
      correlates with increased rates of screening beyond the recommended age, contrary to 
      the study hypothesis. Breast cancer demonstrated the highest rates of nonrecommended 
      screening.

AB  - Health literacy is described as a domain of competence across the life-span, gaining 
      particular prominence in light of age-associated health restrictions. However, no 
      specific measurement approach has been proposed for old age. The aim of this study 
      is to augment the existing HLS-EU-Q16 scale (16 items) by items sensitive to 
      age-specific aspects of health literacy to ensure validity and reliability for use 
      in old age. In a first step, the HLS-EU-Q16 was administered in a sample of 463 
      individuals aged 72 - 92 years. Psychometric properties were evaluated using 
      confirmatory factor analysis and item-response-theory item fit statistics. Scale 
      reliability was found to be poor in this population segment. In a second step, 
      age-specific items were developed based on qualitative in-depth interviews with 
      older persons. In a third step, we tested if the additional set of age-specific 
      items was able to enhance a valid and reliable measurement of health literacy in a 
      second sample of older adults (N = 107, 49 - 91 years). With the inclusion of an 
      eight-item add-on, it was possible to measure health literacy in old and very old 
      age with both high validity and satisfying precision (reliability = 0.80). The study 
      contributes to a population-specific measurement of health literacy.

AB  - Health literacy has a direct impact on pregnancy from the perspectives of both the 
      mother and the baby. This study aimed to determine the level of health literacy and 
      assess the knowledge of antenatal care among pregnant women. From among all pregnant 
      women who presented to the hospital's obstetric polyclinic during the study's 
      timeline, the study group consisted of 460 women who agreed to take part (492 women 
      were invited and a response rate of 93.5% was achieved). A questionnaire prepared 
      based on the literature in line with the study's objectives was completed by the 
      participants under supervision. The Turkish Health Literacy Scale (THLS-32) was used 
      to assess health literacy. In order to determine the women's prenatal care knowledge 
      levels, a total of 20 knowledge-testing statements prepared using the literature 
      were applied, 14 of which were true and six of which were false. The internal 
      consistency of antenatal information questions during pregnancy was made and the 
      Cronbach alpha coefficient was calculated as 0.77. It was determined that 33.9% of 
      the participants had a sufficient level of health literacy. Health literacy was 
      sufficient in young married women (19 years and less) in their first pregnancy and 
      those who had regular reading habits, participated in healthcare activities and 
      received postpartum care at a family health clinic (p < 0.05 for each). While the 
      most accurately evaluated statement about antenatal care was 'It is normal to 
      experience nausea/vomiting in the first trimester of pregnancy', the least 
      accurately evaluated statement was 'Over 35% of women incorrectly believed it was 
      normal to gain 20 kg of weight during pregnancy'. It was found that pregnant women 
      with sufficient health literacy had higher levels of knowledge about antenatal care 
      (p < 0.05). In this study, it was determined that approximately two-thirds of the 
      participants had insufficient health literacy and the women with insufficient health 
      literacy had low levels of knowledge about antenatal care.

TI  - Health literacy of people living with mental illness or substance use disorders: A 
      systematic review.
PG  - 1454-1469
LID - 10.1111/eip.13090 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Health literacy is one's ability to use cognitive and social skills to access, 
      understand and appraise health information. Despite poor health outcomes of people 
      living with mental illness there is limited research assessing their health 
      literacy. This systematic review aims to synthesise research on health literacy 
      rates, conceptualizations, and outcomes of people living with mental illness, 
      including substance use disorders. This will provide insights into how health 
      literacy might be targeted to reduce these health inequities. METHODS: A search of 
      published literature in multiple databases up until February 2019 was conducted. One 
      reviewer screened the titles, abstracts and keywords of identified publications and 
      the eligibility of all full-text publications were assessed for inclusion along with 
      a second reviewer. Both reviewers independently rated the quality of the included 
      studies. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in the review. Rates and measures 
      of health literacy varied. Low health literacy and health literacy weaknesses were 
      identified. There is a lack of research on the relationship between health literacy 
      and other outcomes, particularly health service engagement. CONCLUSION: The review 
      highlights the high rates of low health literacy within this population compared 
      with general populations. Most studies used a functional health literacy measure, 
      despite its limitations, with only a few using multidimensional measures. Overall, 
      there is limited research examining the impact that this populations health literacy 
      has on their recovery and how it affects them over time. The review emphasizes the 
      importance of practitioners assessing and targeting health literacy needs when 
      working with this population.

TI  - Student-driven partnerships enhancing oral health literacy.
PG  - 98-103
LID - 10.1002/hpja.376 [doi]
AB  - ISSUE ADDRESSED: This brief report documents teaching practice that has facilitated 
      deeper connections between Bachelor of Oral Health (BOH) students at The University 
      of Adelaide and community support agencies to promote increased health literacy and 
      confidence to seek care amongst marginalised populations. The aim was to increase 
      the capacity of marginalised groups "to access, understand, appraise and apply 
      information to make effective decisions about health and health care" (Australian 
      Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care. Hlth Lit; 2014. Available from: 
      https://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/standards/nsqhs-standards/partnering-consumers-standard/health-literacy. 
      Accessed January 21, 2020). METHODS: The health promotion curriculum in the BOH 
      course at The University of Adelaide encourages students to focus on health 
      literacy, equity and partnerships in the development of several small targeted 
      health promotion programs. Students co-create, implement and evaluate these 
      programs, engaging community groups, supportive partners and industry 
      stakeholders in a range of unique ways. RESULTS: Sustainable relationships have been 
      established and are growing with partner organisations. As these relationships 
      strengthen, so too does the trust, creative licence, innovation and promotion of the 
      students' involvement directly or indirectly with community. That leads to more 
      frequent touch points with community and greater community buy-in. As familiarity 
      increases, so too does community health literacy and confidence to enter oral health 
      care pathways. CONCLUSION: Strategically planned activity outside of dental setting 
      has the potential to draw community members and dental service providers together, 
      with the enhancement of health literacy and access amongst at-risk populations, an 
      important by-product. SO WHAT?: There seems great potential for further benefits to 
      be realised by oral health students and members of the public when there is 
      multi-stakeholder involvement in co-created health promotion initiatives, that see 
      students further engage with community outside clinical environments.

TI  - Health literacy, digital health literacy and the implementation of digital health 
      technologies in cancer care: the need for a strategic approach.
PG  - 104-114
LID - 10.1002/hpja.387 [doi]
AB  - ISSUE ADDRESSED: Digital health technologies can potentially reduce health 
      disparities in cancer care. However, the benefits of digital health technology 
      depend partly on users' digital health literacy, that is, "capabilities and 
      resources required for individuals to use and benefit from digital health 
      resources," which combines health and digital literacy. We examined issues for 
      digital health technology implementation in cancer care regarding digital health 
      literacy, via stakeholder consultation. METHODS: Consumers, health care 
      professionals, researchers, developers, nongovernment and government/policy 
      stakeholders (N = 51) participated in focus groups/interviews discussing barriers, 
      enablers, needs and opportunities for digital health implementation in cancer care. 
      Researchers applied framework analysis to identify themes of digital health literacy 
      in the context of disparity and inclusion. RESULTS: Limited digital and traditional 
      health literacy were identified as barriers to digital technology engagement, with a 
      range of difficulties identified for older, younger and socio-economically or 
      geographically disadvantaged groups. Digital health technology was a potential 
      enabler of health care access and literacy, affording opportunities to increase 
      reach and engagement. Education combined with targeted design and implementation 
      were identified means of addressing health and digital literacy to effectively 
      implement digital health in cancer care. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing digital health in 
      cancer care must address the variability of digital health literacy in recipients, 
      including groups living with disadvantage and older and younger people, in order to 
      be effective. SO WHAT?: If cancer outcome disparity is to be reduced via digital 
      health technologies, they must be implemented strategically to address digital 
      health literacy needs. Health policy should reflect this approach.

TI  - Health literacy and adherence to treatment in different districts in Chile.
PG  - 1000-1006
LID - 10.1093/heapro/daaa104 [doi]
AB  - The relationship between health literacy and adherence has been described in medical 
      literature, especially for patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs). However, 
      the relevance that an individual's local context can have has not been considered. 
      This study aimed to examine the association of both concepts at a population level 
      and estimate the correlation between health literacy and adherence to 
      pharmacological treatment in adults from 14 districts in different regions in Chile. 
      A cross-sectional study was carried out in 14 districts from 3 different regions of 
      Chile. Sampling was carried out by volunteers. Three questionnaires were applied: 
      sociodemographic; Morisky-Green-Levine (MMAS-4) and the Short Assessment of Health 
      Literacy for Spanish Adults test (SAHLSA-50). Data were analyzed descriptively, and 
      a Multilevel Poisson Regression model was fitted to evaluate the relationship 
      between health literacy and adherence to pharmacological treatment, considering the 
      districts as fixed intercepts. A total of 1,336 persons were surveyed; 811 
      self-reported as having at least 1 NCD. A 83.4% had adequate literacy and 37.1% were 
      adherent to pharmacological treatment, regardless of their health literacy. A 3.6% 
      (variance partition coefficient = 0.036) correlation of adherence to treatment was 
      observed in respondents living in the same district. Those with inadequate health 
      literacy had a 12% greater prevalence of being non-adherent (prevalence ratio 1.12; 
      IC 95% 0.87 - 1.47) when adjusting for individual variables. These results could 
      suggest that the individual's local context does not influence the relation of 
      functional health literacy and adherence to pharmacological treatment in populations 
      with basic and intermediate levels of education. We suggest further studies in this 
      matter.

LID - 10.1080/10410236.2020.1748828 [doi]
AB  - The U.S. Healthy People 2030 health objective-setting process has taken place in an 
      inequitable social structure with significant implications for health literacy, 
      health equity, and population health. The draft 2030 objectives have greatly reduced 
      the number of digital health and health literacy objectives, meaning our national 
      agenda is poised to capture only a fraction of what will evolve in digital and 
      health literacy between 2020 and 2030. This paper synthesizes two decades of Healthy 
      People data on health literacy and digital health objectives, highlights the digital 
      health and health literacy trends and disparities that persist and proposes remedies 
      to ensure that health literacy and digital health issues receive the attention they 
      deserve in the next decade. These remedies can inform policies, research, and 
      interventions that touch health communication and digital health issues.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adequate counseling from a pharmacist concerning anticoagulation therapy 
      is crucial to the wellbeing of patients. No studies have fully examined the 
      relationship between health literacy, patient-pharmacist communication, and 
      anticoagulation control. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the relationship between health 
      literacy and the perceived quality of patient-pharmacist communication among those 
      receiving anticoagulation therapy. METHODS: This investigation utilized structured 
      telephone interviews to evaluate the relationship between health literacy and 
      perceived quality patient-pharmacist communication among patients receiving 
      anticoagulation therapy. Two hundred-twenty participants prescribed anticoagulation 
      therapy continuously for at least 6-months served as the sample for this study. A 
      previously validated one-item screening tool was utilized to estimate health 
      literacy. The primary outcome was patients' perceptions regarding the general 
      communication process with pharmacists, according to the Interpersonal Process of 
      Care questionnaire. RESULTS: Patients possessing inadequate health literacy reported 
      significantly less favorable ratings for the perceived quality of pharmacist 
      communication on the domains of general clarity (p = 0.02), responsiveness to 
      patient concerns (p=<0.01), empowerment (p = 0.01), and consideration of patients' 
      desire and ability to comply with recommendations (p = 0.01). Inadequate health 
      literacy was found to be independently associated with poorer quality interpersonal 
      processes of care across the domains of responsiveness to patient concerns and 
      empowerment, (β = -0.207, P = <0.01 and β = -0.137, P = 0.04, respectively). 
      Patients with inadequate health literacy did not differ significantly from those 
      with adequate health literacy in terms of time within therapeutic INR range or 
      percent of INRs in therapeutic range over the previous 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Patients receiving anticoagulation therapy and possessing inadequate health literacy 
      appear more likely to percieve poorer communication with pharmacists. This seems 
      especially true as it relates to the percieved time and attention pharmacist devote 
      to the communication encounter, as well as the sense pharmacists provide patients 
      concerning their ability to influence health outcomes.

TI  - Organizational Health Literacy: Opportunities for Patient-Centered Care in the Wake 
      of COVID-19.
PG  - 49-60

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is 
      transforming the health care sector. As health care organizations move from crisis 
      mobilization to a new landscape of health and social needs, organizational health 
      literacy offers practical building blocks to provide high-quality, efficient, and 
      meaningful care to patients and their families. Organizational health literacy is 
      defined by the Institute of Medicine as "the degree to which an organization 
      implements policies, practices, and systems that make it easier for people to 
      navigate, understand, and use information and services to take care of their 
      health." METHODS: This article synthesizes insights from organizational health 
      literacy in the context of current major health care challenges and toward the goal 
      of innovation in patient-centered care. We first provide a brief overview of the 
      origins and outlines of organizational health literacy research and practice. 
      Second, using an established patient-centered innovation framework, we show how the 
      existing work on organizational health literacy can offer a menu of effective, 
      patient-centered innovative options for care delivery systems to improve systems and 
      outcomes. Finally, we consider the high value of management focusing on 
      organizational health literacy efforts, specifically for patients in health care 
      transitions and in the rapid transformation of care into myriad distance modalities. 
      RESULTS: This article provides practical guidance for systems and informs decisions 
      around resource allocation and organizational priorities to best meet the needs of 
      patient populations even in the face of financial and workforce disruption. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Organizational health literacy principles and guidelines provide a road 
      map for promoting patient-centered care even in this time of crisis, change, and 
      transformation. Health system leaders seeking innovative approaches can have access 
      to well-established tool kits, guiding models, and materials toward many 
      organizational health literacy goals across treatment, diagnosis, prevention, 
      education, research, and outreach.

AB  - Determine the latent structure of health literacy in persons living with HIV (PLWH) 
      and its association with health management and decision-making. Method: Participants 
      included 220 PLWH and 123 seronegative participants from Southern California and 
      Alabama who completed a battery of well-validated health literacy measures, along 
      with assessments of health management self-efficacy, health-related decision-making, 
      depression, and basic clinical laboratory measures. Results: Exploratory factor 
      analysis in HIV - participants showed that the shared variance between a battery of 
      health literacy measures, including health word reading, verbal comprehension, 
      numeracy, and self-reported problems was best explained by a single factor. 
      Similarly, a confirmatory factor analysis in PLWH also supported a single factor 
      structure, but for a re-specified four-test solution based on the core 
      performance-based measures of health literacy. In analyses adjusting for 
      demographics, PLWH demonstrated significantly lower health literacy composite scores 
      as compared to their HIV - counterparts. Among PLWH, lower health literacy was 
      independently associated with lower self-efficacy for health management and poorer 
      health-related decision-making. Conclusions: Findings suggest that numeracy, word 
      recognition, and verbal comprehension and reasoning comprise a unitary construct of 
      health literacy that is lower in PLWH as compared to seronegatives and is 
      independently associated with important downstream aspects of health management and 
      decision-making.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate functional health literacy and its associated factors 
      among older adults drawn from a disadvantaged area. DESIGN: Cross-sectional 
      epidemiologic study. SETTING: Population-based cohort randomly selected from the 
      voter registration lists. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 65+ (N=1066). MEASUREMENTS: 
      The Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA); demographics; 
      self-rated health; number of prescription drugs; modified Center for Epidemiologic 
      Studies- Depression scale; Mini-Mental State Examination; Wechsler Test of Adult 
      Reading; Clinical Dementia Rating; cognitive domain composite scores; independence 
      in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and medication management; health 
      services utilization (emergency/urgent care visits and hospitalizations). RESULTS: 
      Low (inadequate or marginal) S-TOFHLA scores were obtained by 7.04% of the sample. 
      In unadjusted analyses, participants with low S-TOFHLA scores were significantly 
      more likely than those with higher scores to be older, male, non-White, with lesser 
      education and lower household income, to have lower scores on the Wechsler Test of 
      Adult Reading, the Mini-Mental State Examination, and all cognitive domains; to be 
      more dependent in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and be taking more 
      prescription drugs. In a multiple regression model including all covariates, only 
      older age, male sex, and lower reading level were independently associated with 
      inadequate or marginal S-TOFHLA scores. CONCLUSION: In a population-based sample of 
      older adults, low functional health literacy was associated with age, sex, 
      education, and reading ability. Basic functional health literacy is essential for 
      understanding health information and instructions. Clinicians should formally or 
      informally assess health literacy in their older patients to ensure effective 
      communication and enhance health outcomes.

TI  - A Multilingual Integrative Review of Health Literacy in Former Soviet Union, 
      Russian-Speaking Immigrants.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18020657 [doi]
LID - 657
AB  - Large diasporas of former Soviet Union (FSU) immigrants are found in the USA, 
      Germany, and Israel. To synthesize evidence, identify limitations, and propose 
      future directions we conducted an integrative review on the health literacy of FSU 
      immigrants, migrants, or refugees in four languages. Following integrative review 
      and PRISMA guidelines, we searched four databases in English and performed 
      supplementary searches in Russian, German, and Hebrew to identify qualitative and 
      quantitative studies on FSU immigrants and health literacy. Six articles met 
      inclusion criteria in English and one in German; the majority were published in the 
      last five years. Only two articles measured health literacy of FSU immigrants, which 
      was lower than the general population. Four articles were about immigrants with a 
      mean age ≥50 years. All articles stressed the value of translated, culturally 
      relevant health information. The health literacy of FSU immigrants is understudied, 
      despite clear needs. Future research should include assessments of FSU immigrants' 
      health literacy and include diverse (e.g., age, gender) yet well-defined populations 
      to determine both barriers and facilitators to their health literacy. This review, 
      an example of a multilingual search, provided a comprehensive understanding of 
      existing literature and is a useful approach for global health literacy research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low health literacy has been associated with worse health outcomes, but 
      little is known about the effectiveness of health literacy interventions developed 
      for pregnant women. AIM: To assess the effectiveness of health literacy 
      interventions on pregnancy outcomes through a systematic review of randomised 
      controlled trials. METHODS: Randomised controlled trials that assessed health 
      literacy interventions designed to improve pregnancy outcomes were included. The 
      study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018094958). FINDINGS: Of the 1512 
      records initially identified, 13 studies were included. Three reported on 
      decision-aid interventions, six on face-to-face interventions and four on written 
      interventions (including computer-based interventions or information leaflets). The 
      primary outcomes of interest for this systematic review were knowledge (10/13 
      studies) and health literacy (2/13 studies) with one study not reporting either 
      primary outcome. A significant improvement in knowledge was found across the 10 
      studies, however the two studies which measured health literacy only assessed health 
      literacy at a single time-point. Secondary outcomes including health behaviours, 
      fetal outcomes and health-service utilisation were reported in 11 studies, with 
      inconsistent results. DISCUSSION: Few health literacy interventions have been 
      developed specifically for pregnant women. Although health literacy interventions 
      have the potential to improve knowledge and pregnancy outcomes, current evidence is 
      limited by inconsistent outcomes and measurement, and limited use of health literacy 
      theory to inform intervention design and content. Few studies directly measured 
      health literacy. CONCLUSION: More research is needed to properly assess the effect 
      of health literacy interventions on pregnancy outcomes. This research should include 
      consideration of health literacy theory in the development of the interventions.

TI  - Health Literacy and Its Mediating Role in Predicting Health Behaviors Among Chinese 
      Secondary Students.
PG  - 76-83
LID - 10.1177/1010539520980926 [doi]
AB  - While health literacy research in mainland China has gained increasing attention, 
      most studies focus on adults. This study aimed to examine the mediating role of 
      health literacy in the relationship between a range of upstream factors and health 
      behaviors among Chinese secondary students. A cross-sectional study was conducted 
      with 650 students in Years 7 to 9 from four secondary schools in Beijing. Based on 
      an adapted health literacy framework from Manganello, a self-administered 
      questionnaire was designed to collect information on upstream factors, health 
      literacy, and health behaviors. Path analysis results showed that the proposed 
      framework was mostly supported by empirical data after modification indices were 
      examined and 3 direct paths were added. Students' self-efficacy, social support, and 
      school environment were associated with health literacy, which in turn predicted 
      health behaviors. A holistic approach is needed to improve both adolescent health 
      literacy and health behaviors for Chinese school-aged adolescents.

TI  - Health literacy needs in weight management of women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.
PG  - 41-48
LID - 10.1002/hpja.349 [doi]
AB  - ISSUE ADDRESSED: Lifestyle modification plays a key role in weight management and 
      chronic disease prevention in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS 
      experience challenges in adopting and maintaining healthy lifestyle behaviours, 
      which may be related to health literacy. The aims of this study were to explore the 
      health literacy needs of women with PCOS in lifestyle and weight management to 
      inform research and practice. METHODS: Ten women with PCOS participated in focus 
      groups and semi-structured telephone interviews on lifestyle and weight management 
      in PCOS. RESULTS: For functional health literacy, women with PCOS are highly 
      motivated for lifestyle and weight management due to the long-term consequences of 
      PCOS. For interactive health literacy, barriers included delayed diagnosis and poor 
      communication. Women with PCOS were resourceful in accessing a wide range of weight 
      management services but some experience barriers such as costs or the feelings of 
      embarrassment associated with accessing relevant services. For critical health 
      literacy, no facilitators and barriers could be identified for the domain of 
      participation in making decisions for health. CONCLUSIONS: Women with PCOS 
      experience facilitators and barriers in functional and interactive health literacy 
      in lifestyle and weight management. SO WHAT?: Future interventions should seek to 
      further understand and address these gaps in health literacy by increasing weight 
      management skills through behaviour change techniques, improving health 
      professional-patient communication through tools such as question prompt lists, 
      enhancing peer support by increasing distributed health literacy in PCOS support 
      groups and by providing opportunities for co-design of interventions.

AB  - PURPOSE: Patients increasingly prefer to be involved in health decisions. Shared 
      decisions are associated with less decisional conflict and improved satisfaction. 
      This study examines the relationship between health literacy and preferred 
      decision-making role in patients seeking care for hand problems. METHODS: We 
      performed a cross-sectional study of 226 patients who were presenting to a hand 
      service for the first time, who were older than 18 years, not pregnant, and fluent 
      and literate in English. Patient demographic information, work status, and education 
      level were collected from the patient. Diagnosis and insurance status were collected 
      from the medical record. Pain interference, depression, and upper extremity function 
      were measured using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
      (PROMIS) questionnaires administered with computerized adaptive testing. Health 
      literacy and preferred decision-making role were assessed using the Newest Vital 
      Sign Test and Control Preference Scale, respectively. Discordance between preferred 
      and actual decision-making role was assessed using the Control Preference Scale 
      statements with the words "I prefer" omitted. Bivariate and multivariable logistic 
      regressions were used to assess for factors associated with preferred 
      decision-making role and discordance. RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent of patients 
      preferred an active or collaborative, rather than a passive, role in decision 
      making. Sixty-one percent felt they had achieved their preferred role. Preferred 
      role and achievement of that role were not associated with health literacy, age, 
      race, insurance, work status, diagnosis, pain intensity, symptoms of depression, and 
      magnitude of self-reported activity limitations. More years of education was 
      associated with a more active preferred decision-making role but not with obtaining 
      that preferred role. CONCLUSIONS: Most people want to participate in decisions about 
      their care even if they have low health literacy. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Hand 
      specialists can seek strategies to help people understand and participate in care 
      decisions.

TI  - "Was Test Designed for Africans?" Health Literacy and African Immigrants.
LID - 10.1007/s40615-020-00959-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immigrants experience barriers to accessing and utilizing health care. 
      Language and cultural differences regarding health and healing impact use of health 
      care. Limited health literacy is associated with decreased preventive health 
      services and is reported among immigrant groups in the USA, but the health literacy 
      of African immigrants is not known. OBJECTIVE: Assess health literacy, its 
      association with engagement in primary care and select sociodemographic variables, 
      and the use of two health literacy measures with African immigrants. METHODS: We 
      conducted a community-based participatory research cross-sectional survey among 
      African immigrants in Massachusetts. Participants completed the Newest Vital Sign, 
      the Health Literacy Skills Instrument, acceptability questionnaires, and a Health 
      Survey. We observed and recorded comments and questions as participants completed 
      the surveys. KEY RESULTS: Out of 75 participants, 60% have limited health literacy. 
      Over 80% are connected to a health care system and comfortable speaking with their 
      doctor/nurse. Education, English proficiency, country of origin, and access to 
      health care are associated with health literacy. Participants found the measures 
      easy to understand but difficult to answer. Observation data revealed unfamiliarity 
      with nutrition labels, cooking measurements, and navigation of internet links, and 
      the need for clarification of select items. CONCLUSIONS: Most African immigrants in 
      this study have limited health literacy despite English proficiency, college 
      education, employment, and connection to a health system. Further research is needed 
      to determine the value of aligning the measurement of health literacy with the 
      cultural-linguistic identities of the population being assessed versus the need to 
      understand their health literacy within the dominant culture.

TI  - Public libraries as health literate multi-purpose workspaces for improving health 
      literacy.
PG  - 29-32
LID - 10.1002/hpja.437 [doi]
AB  - Now more than ever, in this COVID-19 pandemic, our individual and collective ability 
      to access, understand and apply information to inform our health care and broader 
      lifestyle decisions ie, to be health literate - has life or death consequences. This 
      paper reflects upon the proposition of public libraries as health literate 
      multi-purpose workspaces for improving health literacy. We draw upon our combined 
      experiences as evaluators of organizational health literacy initiatives, and library 
      sector development, engagement and advocacy. Key ideas were presented as part of the 
      2020 State Library Victoria seminar series on 'Libraries: The Heart of a Healthy 
      Community'. Key messages included: Public libraries are well positioned to 
      contribute to the health literacy movement, as they provide the general public with: 
      universal free access to information and services; extensive in-house and outreach 
      educational collaborative learning opportunities; and health and wellbeing support 
      by being welcoming, safe, and trusted community spaces. To date, limited discussion 
      exists about conceptualizing public libraries as health literate multi-purpose 
      workspaces for supporting and sustaining public library health literacy efforts. A 
      health literate organizational framework is suggested to support libraries simply 
      supporting health information literacy to being recognised as health literate 
      organizations. Five workspace principles (empowerment, equitable, inclusive, 
      collaborative and integrated) are suggested to provide directions for public 
      libraries as health literate multi-purpose workspaces for improving the health 
      literacy of individuals, communities, organizations and indeed systems. To inform 
      the design, implementation and evaluation of public libraries as workspaces for 
      improving health literacy, key principles-focused evaluation questions are suggested 
      for consideration. SO WHAT?: Public Libraries as welcoming, safe, and trusted 
      community organizations are well placed to be health literate multipurpose 
      workspaces for improving health literacy.

TI  - Health Literacy and Associated Outcomes in the Postpartum Period at Grady Memorial 
      Hospital.
PG  - 599-605
LID - 10.1007/s10995-020-03030-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Many studies correlate lower health literacy with poorer health outcomes 
      and inferior provider-patient communication. Little is known about how impaired 
      health literacy among women receiving prenatal care at inner city public hospitals 
      may impact reproductive health behaviors and outcomes. The objective of this study 
      was to assess health literacy among postpartum women receiving care at a public 
      tertiary care center and to explore the association of impaired health literacy with 
      prenatal care attendance and postpartum outcomes. METHODS: Written consent was 
      obtained before completing the 7-item REALM-SF study tool to assess health literacy. 
      A score of zero to three indicated low health literacy, four to six moderately low 
      health literacy, and seven adequate health literacy. Patients completed a 25-item 
      demographic questionnaire, and medical outcomes were obtained via this questionnaire 
      and chart review. Descriptive statistics were generated, and bivariate and 
      multivariate analyses evaluated the association between REALM-SF score and study 
      outcomes. RESULTS: We recruited 300 adult English-speaking postpartum women and 293 
      were included in the final analysis. The majority of participants (53.9%) 
      experienced impaired health literacy (score zero to six). Most respondents completed 
      high school or higher education (77.1%), 17.8% had no prenatal care, and 83.6% 
      reported that this pregnancy was unplanned. After adjusting for age, race, and 
      education, women in the lowest health literacy group were less likely to indicate a 
      plan to exclusively breastfeed (aRR = 0.54, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: 
      Impaired health literacy affects a majority of our patients and is associated with 
      reproductive health outcomes, including exclusive breastfeeding. Health care 
      providers should attempt to overcome differences in health literacy through strong 
      breastfeeding promotion. Verbal and written patient education materials should be 
      tailored to the needs of patients with impaired health literacy.

PG  - 659-667
LID - 10.1007/s10903-020-01123-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health literacy has yet to be described in a non-clinical, racially 
      diverse, community-based cohort. METHODS: Four questions assessing health literacy 
      were asked during annual phone encounters with Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis 
      (MESA) participants between 2016 and 2018 (n = 3629). We used prevalence ratios 
      (PRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to characterize how demographic and 
      acculturation factors related to limited health literacy. Models adjusted for age, 
      sex, and race/ethnicity, and race/ethnicity-stratified models were also examined. 
      RESULTS: Limited health literacy was prevalent in 15.4% of the sample. Participants 
      who were older, female, lower-income, or less acculturated were at greater risk for 
      having limited health literacy. Chinese, Hispanic, and Black participants were more 
      likely than White participants to have limited health literacy. Patterns were 
      similar when stratified by race/ethnicity. DISCUSSION: Within MESA limited health 
      literacy was common, particularly among Chinese and Hispanic participants, with some 
      of the variance explained by differences in acculturation.

TI  - Child mental health literacy training programmes for professionals in contact with 
      children: A systematic review.
PG  - 234-247
LID - 10.1111/eip.12964 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: There has been a surge in child mental health literacy training programmes for 
      non-mental health professionals. No previous review has examined the effectiveness 
      of child mental literacy training on all professionals in contact with children. 
      METHODS: Studies were identified through a systematic literature search of the 
      Cochrane, EMBASE, Medline, and PsycINFO databases in February 2019. The review 
      included studies that delivered training to professionals who have regular contact 
      with young people aged 0 to 19 in the context of their role and at least one 
      component of mental health literacy; (a) knowledge, (b) attitudes, (c) confidence in 
      helping, (d) intention to help and (e) actual helping behaviour. The quality of 
      papers was reviewed using the Cochrane revised Risk of Bias Tool for randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) and the Integrated Quality Criteria for the Review of 
      Multiple Study Designs for non RCTs. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies met eligibility 
      criteria (n = 3243). There was some evidence that global and specific child mental 
      health literacy training improved professionals' knowledge and stigma-related 
      attitudes towards mental health. Few studies investigated the impact of training on 
      actual helping behaviour. CONCLUSION: There may be value in providing child mental 
      health literacy training to professionals in contact with children, however there is 
      a need for studies to evaluate the long-term impact of such training, particularly 
      on subsequent access to appropriate support. Findings raise concerns about the 
      quality of the studies reported in the systematic review and recommendations are 
      made for future studies.

TI  - Health literacy for children and families.
LID - 10.1111/bcp.14948 [doi]
AB  - The relationship between reading ability and health, known as health literacy, 
      broadly reflects the skills and competencies required to operate within the 
      healthcare environment. It is only recently that we have seen attempts to 
      conceptualize health literacy in the context of medication use by using terms such 
      as medication literacy. Health literacy changes over one's lifetime and is dependent 
      on factors such as numeracy, education, income, gender and country. Low health 
      literacy and low medication literacy have been identified as significant risk 
      factors for poor health outcomes of adults and children. With an evaluation of 
      common tools used to assess health literacy and medication literacy, the aim of this 
      review is to describe the shared responsibility between patients and healthcare 
      providers for the communication of health and medication information. Key strategies 
      and interventions to improve two-way communication between patients and healthcare 
      providers are highlighted, with a focus on how health literacy can impact child 
      health outcomes.

TI  - Health Literacy in Korean Adults and Korean American Immigrants: Implications for 
      Achieving Health Equity.
PG  - 29-36

AB  - Health literacy is necessary to understand health information and make appropriate 
      decisions regarding one's health. This study aims to investigate (1) the health 
      literacy level of Korean citizens and Korean American (KA) immigrants in the United 
      States and (2) factors that influence health literacy across three age groups. A 
      quota sampling method was used to collect cross-sectional survey data from 404 
      Korean participants and 404 KA immigrants. Andersen's behavioral model was used as 
      the theoretical framework for this study. Overall, Korean participants had a higher 
      mean score on health literacy than did the KA immigrants. Only one of predisposing 
      and enabling factors were significant variables influencing health literacy in KA 
      immigrants, while several predisposing, enabling and need factors were significantly 
      associated with health literacy in Korean adults. Our findings indicate that both 
      countries need to have a community-based health literacy educational program that is 
      tailored to each age group.

TI  - The Influence of Health Literacy and Health Numeracy on Weight Loss Outcomes 
      Following Bariatric Surgery.
PG  - 384-389
LID - S1550-7289(20)30551-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.soard.2020.09.021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although cognitive functioning and health literacy are related to weight 
      loss 1year following bariatric surgery, the influence of health numeracy (i.e., 
      health-related mathematical abilities) is unknown. In addition, further research is 
      needed to examine the impact of all these factors on longer-term weight loss 
      outcomes to determine if they influence the ability to maintain weight loss. 
      SETTING: Single bariatric center. METHODS: Patients (N = 567) who underwent 
      bariatric surgery from 2014-2017 completed a brief survey including current weight. 
      Retrospective chart reviews were conducted to gather information from the 
      presurgical evaluation including weight, body mass index (BMI), health literacy, 
      health numeracy and score on a cognitive screener. RESULTS: Among participants in 
      the weight loss period (< 2 years postsurgery), health literacy, health numeracy and 
      cognitive functioning were not related to change in BMI (ΔBMI), percent total weight 
      loss (%TWL) or percent excess weight loss (%EWL). However, for participants in the 
      weight maintenance period (2-4 years postsurgery), higher health literacy scores 
      were related to greater change in ΔBMI, and higher health numeracy scores were 
      related to greater ΔBMI, %TWL, and %EWL. DISCUSSION: Although health literacy and 
      health numeracy did not predict weight loss outcomes for those in the initial weight 
      loss period, they were related to weight outcomes for participants in the weight 
      maintenance period. This suggests that health literacy and health numeracy may play 
      a role in facilitating longer-term weight maintenance among patients who undergo 
      bariatric surgery. Clinicians conducting presurgical psychosocial evaluations should 
      consider routinely screening for health literacy and health numeracy.

TI  - Health literacy and e-health literacy among Arabic-speaking migrants in Sweden: a 
      cross-sectional study.
PG  - 2165
LID - 10.1186/s12889-021-12187-5 [doi]
LID - 2165
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health inequities arise when the public cannot access and understand 
      health information in an easy, accessible, and understandable way. Evidence supports 
      that health literacy (HL) is a determinant for health outcomes, and when HL is 
      limited this may have a major impact on morbidity as well as mortality. Migrants are 
      known to have limited HL. Therefore, this study aimed to explore comprehensive 
      health literacy (CHL) and electronic health literacy (eHL) among Arabic-speaking 
      migrants in Sweden. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional observational study 
      conducted in Sweden. A total of 703 persons were invited to participate between 
      February and September 2019. Two questionnaires - the Health Literacy Survey 
      European Questionnaire (HLS-EU-Q16) and the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) - and 
      questions about self-perceived health and Internet use were distributed in Swedish 
      and Arabic. Various statistical analyses were performed to determine the 
      associations for limited CHL and eHL. RESULTS: A total of 681 respondents were 
      included in the analysis. Of these, 334 (49%) were native Arabic-speaking migrants 
      and 347 (51%) were native Swedish-speaking residents. CHL and eHL differed between 
      the groups. The Arabic speakers had significantly lower mean sum scores in eHL 28.1 
      (SD 6.1) vs 29.3 (6.2), p = 0.012 and lower proportion of sufficient CHL 125 (38.9%) 
      vs 239 (71.3%), p < 0.001 compared to Swedish speakers. Multiple regression analysis 
      showed on associations between limited CHL and eHL and being Arabic speaking, less 
      Internet use, and not finding the Internet to be important or useful. Furthermore, 
      longer time spent in Sweden was associated with higher levels of CHL among the 
      Arabic speakers, (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.91-0.98, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: CHL and eHL 
      differ between Arabic-speaking migrants and native Swedish speakers, but also 
      between Arabic speakers who have lived different lengths of time in Sweden. Though 
      it seems that the eHealth literacy is less affected by language spoken, the Internet 
      is suggested to be an appropriate channel for disseminating health information to 
      Arabic-speaking migrants.

TI  - Health literacy of people living with HIV in a rural area in Indonesia: A 
      cross-sectional study.
PG  - 127-134
LID - 10.1111/hsc.13075 [doi]
AB  - Indonesia, the fourth most populated country in the world, has experienced a 
      fivefold increase in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected individuals since 
      2001. Little is known about health literacy in people living with HIV (PLHIV) in 
      Indonesia. This study aimed to determine the level of health literacy among PLHIV in 
      Indonesia and assess associations between sociodemographic variables, beliefs about 
      medicines, stigma and health literacy. We conducted a cross-sectional study using 
      questionnaires in PLHIV in Papua, Indonesia. The short version of the Test of 
      Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA), Beliefs about Medicines 
      Questionnaire (BMQ) and HIV stigma scale as well as questions on demographic 
      information were completed by the participants from two hospitals in Papua, 
      Indonesia. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, we assessed the 
      association between sociodemographic variables, stigma, beliefs about medicine and 
      low health literacy. Overall, 331 participants were included, 62.0% female, 67.0% 
      Papuans. A total of 38.5% of participants had low health literacy. PLHIV with 
      multi-dose regimen were less likely to have low health literacy than those taking a 
      fixed-dose combination (OR = 0.51; 95%CI = 0.32-0.82). PLHIV who had social support 
      in medicine-taking were more likely to have low health literacy (OR = 1.78; 
      95%CI = 1.07-2.97). More awareness about medication overuse (OR = 1.17; 
      95%CI = 1.06-1.29) and medication harm (OR = 1.10; 95%CI = 1.01-1.20) were also 
      associated with having low health literacy. Overall, interventions targeting health 
      literacy may be a promising strategy to improve self-management.

TI  - Addressing Health Literacy Needs in Rheumatology: Which Patient Health Literacy 
      Profiles Need the Attention of Health Professionals?
PG  - 100-109
LID - 10.1002/acr.24480 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify and describe health literacy profiles of patients with 
      rheumatic diseases and explore whether the identified health literacy profiles can 
      be generalized to a broader rheumatology context. METHODS: Patients with rheumatoid 
      arthritis, spondyloarthritis, and gout from 3 hospitals in different regions in The 
      Netherlands completed the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ). Hierarchical cluster 
      analysis was used to identify patients' health literacy profiles based on 9 HLQ 
      domains. A multinomial regression model with the identified health literacy profiles 
      as the dependent variable was fitted to assess whether patients with a given disease 
      type or attending a given hospital were more likely to belong to a specific profile. 
      RESULTS: Among 895 participating patients, the lowest mean HLQ domain scores 
      (indicating most difficulty) were found for "critical appraisal," "navigating the 
      health system," and "finding good health information." The 10 identified profiles 
      revealed substantial diversity in combinations of strengths and weaknesses. While 
      42% of patients scored moderate to high on all 9 domains (profiles 1 and 3), another 
      42% of patients (profiles 2, 4, 5, and 6) clearly struggled with 1 or several 
      aspects of health literacy. Notably, 16% (profiles 7-10) exhibited difficulty across 
      a majority of health literacy domains. The probability of belonging to one of the 
      profiles was independent of the hospital where the patient was treated or the type 
      of rheumatic disease. CONCLUSION: Ten distinct health literacy profiles were 
      identified among patients with rheumatic diseases, independent of disease type and 
      treating hospital. These profiles can be used to facilitate the development of 
      health literacy interventions in rheumatology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health tools are of little use if the intended user lacks the 
      skills to effectively engage them. Engaging eHealth requires a skill set, or 
      literacy, of its own. The present study is an effort to probe the relationship of 
      education and Institution (Independent Variables) with the usage and expertise in 
      eHealth literacy (Dependent Variables) among university students. The research is 
      conducted in 16 Higher Education Commission (HEC) Pakistan's recognized universities 
      in Lahore. Both male and female students ranging from BS to PhD programs were the 
      focus of the research. METHODS: Quantitative data was collected through survey 
      method using stratified random sampling technique. There were different kinds of 
      strata in population i.e. general universities, health sciences universities, 
      engineering universities and animal sciences universities etc. The research 
      encompassed a total of 89,664 students in 16 universities, from which sample size of 
      1513 was drawn through research advisor table (2006). Proportional allocation 
      formula was used to specify the number of respondents from each university. 
      Non-parametric statistics was used since data was not normally distributed. 
      Kruskal-Wallis H test and Mann-Whitney U test were applied to measure the difference 
      of effect of groups of independent variables on the dependent variables. RESULTS: 
      The level of using digital health literacy was not same for all students, as the 
      students of PhD and BS/Masters were significantly different from each other in terms 
      of their usage of digital health literacy. Level of education showed a significant 
      influence on level of expertise in eHealth literacy, confirming that changing the 
      level of education had an effect on level of expertise in digital health literacy, 
      but the size of effect was smaller. MS/MPhil and PhD students were significantly 
      different from each other in their expertise in digital health literacy. CONCLUSION: 
      Results of the study depicted that belonging to different categories of educational 
      levels differently affect the level of usage and that of expertise in digital health 
      literacy among university students.

TI  - The Value of Community Health Literacy Assessments: Health Literacy in Maryland.
PG  - 333549211002767
LID - 10.1177/00333549211002767 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Community health assessments have typically not measured health literacy 
      at the community level. We developed the Community Health Literacy Assessment (CHLA) 
      framework to describe county and regional health literacy activities, assets, gaps, 
      and opportunities in Maryland. METHODS: We implemented the CHLA framework in 
      Maryland from January to August 2018. We conducted an environmental scan of 
      Maryland's 24 counties to identify community resources, health indicators, and 
      organizations. We targeted local health improvement coalitions and health 
      departments for interviews in each county. We conducted qualitative interviews to 
      understand what key community organizations throughout Maryland are doing to 
      implement health literacy best practices and policies. We used summative content 
      analysis to review, quantify, and interpret interview data. RESULTS: We conducted 57 
      interviews with participants from 56 organizations representing all 24 counties in 
      Maryland. We captured data on multiple dimensions of health literacy and identified 
      3 main themes: health literacy assets and activities, health literacy gaps, and 
      health literacy opportunities. The most cited asset was collecting data to inform 
      health literacy practices, the most cited gap was using jargon with community 
      members, and the most cited opportunity was increasing public awareness of existing 
      health programs through improved outreach and teaching health information-seeking 
      behaviors. CONCLUSION: A systematic community health literacy assessment is a 
      feasible way to collect a large amount of health literacy data, which can inform 
      strategic planning, determine community interventions, and ultimately lead us toward 
      a health-literate society. We recommend that others replicate the CHLA framework to 
      operationalize health literacy as a health indicator and include it as a community 
      health assessment measure.

TI  - Impact of Limited Health Literacy on Patient-Reported Outcomes in Systemic Lupus 
      Erythematosus.
PG  - 110-119
LID - 10.1002/acr.24361 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Health disparities in patient-reported outcomes by income and education 
      are well documented; however, the impact of health literacy on patient-reported 
      outcomes has received less attention. We examined independent effects of income, 
      education, and health literacy on patient-reported outcomes in systemic lupus 
      erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Data from the California Lupus Epidemiology Study (n = 
      323 participants) were used. Health literacy was assessed with a validated 3-item 
      measure (ability to understand written information, reliance on others to understand 
      written information, confidence in completing written forms). Patient-reported 
      outcomes were administered by interview in English, Spanish, Cantonese, or Mandarin. 
      Generic and disease-specific patient-reported outcomes were examined using the 
      following: 10 Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 
      short forms; the 8 Short Form 36 (SF-36) health survey subscales; and 3 
      patient-reported SLE disease activity and damage measures. We conducted 2 sets of 
      multivariable analyses: the first examined education, income, or health literacy 
      individually; the second included all 3 simultaneously. All multivariable models 
      included age, sex, race/ethnicity, language, disease duration, and 
      physician-assessed disease activity and damage. RESULTS: More than one-third of 
      participants (38%) had limited health literacy (LHL), including >25% with greater 
      than high school education. In multivariable analyses simultaneously considering 
      education, income, and health literacy, LHL was associated with significantly worse 
      scores on all patient-reported outcomes except disease damage. In contrast, 
      disparities by income were seen in only 3 PROMIS scales, 3 SF-36 subscales, and 1 
      disease activity measure. No disparities by education level were noted. CONCLUSION: 
      We found significantly worse patient-reported outcome scores among individuals with 
      LHL, even after controlling for disease activity and damage. Whether disparities are 
      due to actual differences in health or measurement issues requires further study.

TI  - HealthLit4Kids: Supporting schools to be health literacy responsive organisations.
PG  - 17-28
LID - 10.1002/hpja.412 [doi]
AB  - ISSUE ADDRESSED: To reduce inequity, services and community organisations must 
      respond to the health literacy needs and strengths of each individual accessing 
      their services. As a social determinant, health literacy is compounded by 
      interactions between the service provider, the individual, and their wider 
      community. Schools provide a critical nexus between the teacher (as service 
      provider), the student (as learner) and their family (carers and wider community) to 
      support the development of children's health literacy. METHODS: Five Tasmanian 
      primary schools (84 teachers) completed an assessment of their school in relation to 
      the domains of a health literate organisation using the HeLLOTas! (HEalth Literacy 
      Learning Organisations Tasmania) Self-Assessment Checklist, before and after taking 
      part in the HealthLit4Kids program. RESULTS: While the differences between pre- and 
      post-intervention ratings were not large, they moved in a positive direction for all 
      six domains. There was a significant main effect of time, F (1, 4) = 83.9, P < .001, 
      ƞ(2)  = 0.99, showing that overall ratings increased from before to after the 
      intervention. Teacher-recommended actions across all schools were grouped for 
      insight into their interpretation and application of the tool in the school context. 
      CONCLUSION: Using the HeLLOTas! Self-Assessment Checklist served a dual purpose. 
      Teachers developed a shared understanding of the characteristics of a 
      health-literate organisation to produce a schoolwide action plan. Simultaneously, we 
      gained valuable insights into the processes required to support the development of 
      organisational health literacy in schools, and we share ten propositions applicable 
      to other schools locally, nationally and internationally. SO WHAT?: To the best of 
      our knowledge, this is the first time that a school's health literacy responsiveness 
      has been measured. Our key propositions will support future efforts by policy 
      makers, researchers and school principals.

TI  - Exploring health literacy and its associated factors among Palestinian university 
      students: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 854-865
LID - 10.1093/heapro/daaa089 [doi]
AB  - Health literacy plays an important role in personal and community health. Since 
      university is a turning point when young adults begin to take responsibility for 
      their own health, understanding university students' health literacy levels is 
      crucial. To this end, we aimed to explore health literacy and its associated factors 
      among Palestinian university students. We conducted a cross-sectional study at 
      Birzeit University in the Ramallah district. We recruited 472 students using 
      convenience sampling at six on-campus cafeterias. The 44-item Arabic version of the 
      Health Literacy Questionnaire was used to measure students' health literacy levels, 
      while a locally developed distress scale was used to measure students' distress 
      levels. We stratified the multiple regression model for the health literacy score by 
      gender. Students' average total health literacy score was 135.3 (SD 20.9), with male 
      students scoring significantly higher than female students. A higher health literacy 
      score was significantly associated with having a father with a higher level of 
      education, a higher frequency of medical checkups, higher self-reported health 
      status, and consulting a higher number of sources for health-related information. 
      High distress levels were associated with lower levels of health literacy, 
      especially among female students. This study provides the first evidence on 
      Palestinian university students' health literacy levels. Tailored health education 
      and promotion are required for students with low parental education and moderate to 
      high distress. Future research is required to explain the gender differences in 
      health literacy and distress among university students.

PG  - 481-487
LID - 10.1080/09638237.2020.1713998 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stigma reduction has been identified as a key public health strategy to 
      increase enrollment in behavioral health services. As our understanding about stigma 
      reduction has become more sophisticated, there has been an increased recognition 
      that efforts to reduce stigma must engage the complex relationships between stigma, 
      literacy, and contact with others who have a behavioral health condition. AIMS: The 
      goal of this project was to improve understanding about the relationships between 
      behavioral health literacy, stigma, and contact to inform efforts to increase public 
      behavioral health literacy and decrease stigma. Specifically, this project explored 
      how the structure of these relationships varied for different substance use and 
      mental health conditions. METHOD: Structural equation modeling was used to depict 
      relationships with data from a nationally-representative survey on behavioral health 
      literacy and stigma. RESULTS: The impact of prior contact and literacy on stigma 
      varied by behavioral health condition. CONCLUSIONS: Stigma reduction efforts will be 
      most successful when they match the level of literacy and prior contact with the 
      condition among the target audience for stigma reduction efforts.

LID - daaa141
AB  - In the current COVID-19 pandemic the active participation of the public is of 
      central importance, however, certain factors found in this new pandemic disease 
      complicates the participation. Addressing these complications needs public health 
      and health promotion experts to understand the role of critical health literacy in a 
      pandemic. We present the case for a definition of critical health literacy in a 
      pandemic, CHL-P. We suggest that CHL-P can help professionals to support individuals 
      and communities as agents for effectively dealing with the unique features of this 
      pandemic.

TI  - Health literacy and health outcomes in China's floating population: mediating 
      effects of health service.
PG  - 691
LID - 10.1186/s12889-021-10662-7 [doi]
LID - 691
AB  - BACKGROUND: The floating population in China consists primarily of internal 
      immigrants and represents a typical health vulnerable group. Poor health literacy 
      has recently become an obstacle in the accessibility and utilization of health 
      services for the vulnerable population, leading to adverse health outcomes. This 
      study aimed to examine whether health literacy affected health outcomes in China's 
      floating population and whether health service utilization had a mediating effect 
      between health literacy and health outcomes. METHOD: The current study utilized a 
      cross-sectional stratified, multistage, proportional to scale (PPS) study in 
      Zhejiang Province, China, in November and December 2019. In total, 657 valid 
      self-reported questionnaires were recovered and used for data collection. 
      Questionnaires included questions regarding sociodemographic characteristics, health 
      literacy, health outcomes, and health service utilization. Confirmatory factor 
      analysis was used to test questionnaire validity; descriptive statistics were used 
      to understand the demographic characteristics of the floating population; and 
      structural equation modeling was used to determine whether health service 
      utilization mediated health literacy and health outcomes. RESULTS: We report 
      positive correlations between health literacy, health service utilization, and 
      health outcomes. Mediation analysis demonstrated that health service utilization had 
      partial mediating effects between health literacy and health outcomes. In the 
      relationship between health literacy and health outcomes, the indirect effects of 
      health service utilization accounted for 6.6-8.7% of the total effects. CONCLUSION: 
      Complete health literacy, through health care literacy and health promotion 
      literacy, affects the mobile population's initiative to use health services, which, 
      in turn, affects health outcomes. Thus, improving the health literacy of the 
      floating population will help to improve health outcomes. Furthermore, health 
      service providers should enhance the diversity of health service supply to ensure 
      that the floating population has the external resources to improve personal health 
      literacy.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess university students' levels of psychological 
      distress and mental health literacy. DESIGN AND METHODS: This descriptive and 
      cross-sectional study using self-assessment instruments with 417 volunteer 
      university students was conducted in the fall semester of the 2019-2020 academic 
      year. FINDINGS: More than half of the participants had diagnosable psychological 
      distress in terms of mental illness. The participants had a low level of mental 
      health literacy, females and people with a mental illness had higher mental health 
      literacy scores. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The results indicated that the scales could 
      be used to develop interventions to assist Turkish students' transition to healthy 
      adulthood. Determining individuals' psychological distress allows early detection of 
      mental problems.

LID - 10.1093/heapro/daaa151 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of our study was to determine the health literacy level of the study 
      participants and examine the relationship between health literacy levels and 
      sociodemographic characteristics, health self-assessment levels and health 
      protective behaviors. We recruited 826 individuals into the study, selecting the 
      participants by using a systematic random sampling method. Data were collected with 
      a descriptive information form, the European Health Literacy Scale and a General 
      Health Behaviors Scale. The analysis of the data was carried out using numbers and 
      percentages, the Chi Square test and ordinal regression analysis. We found that the 
      level of health literacy was inadequate in 25.9% of the study participants, 
      problematic/limited in 41.4% had, adequate in 23.6% and excellent in 9.1%. A 
      statistically significant correlation was found between an adequate level of health 
      literacy and being relatively more educated, having a chronic disease, being able to 
      follow up on health news, reading publications on health and being better able to 
      evaluate one's own health (p < 0.05). Additionally, a statistically significant 
      correlation was observed between adequate health literacy levels and being in the 
      later stages of the transtheoretical model in terms of general health behaviors in 
      the domains outside of monitoring one's own weight and avoiding the sun (p < 0.05). 
      The level of adequate health literacy was discovered to be lower in our study than 
      in Europe. Health protective behaviors show an increase among individuals who 
      display an adequate level of health literacy.

TI  - Health Literacy and Food Literacy for K-12 Schools in the COVID-19 Pandemic.
PG  - 650-659

AB  - BACKGROUND: Food literacy, a sub-area of health literacy, is achieving attention in 
      schools, academia, research, health care, businesses, and governments worldwide. 
      Against the current COVID-19 pandemic backdrop, the relevance of food literacy's 
      interconnected attributes such as nutritional knowledge, food skills, and food 
      environment is gaining traction. Enhancing health and food literacy in the K-12 
      school environment are important empowerment tools with the potential to reduce 
      health inequalities as vulnerable people are at risk of limited health literacy. 
      METHODS: We aim to clarify the meaning of food literacy and its relationship to 
      health literacy and other factors influencing eating behavior. RESULTS: We offer a 
      proposed conceptual model depicting connections between relevant theories and 
      constructs in the field of health and nutrition. Concrete actions are offered that 
      contemporary schools can take guided by the utility of the model. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      visual can help guide schools' multidimensional health and food literacy efforts 
      while considering the realities of the current COVID-19 pandemic context and beyond. 
      This model will provide an overarching reference for schools to consider key 
      constructs to support practice, research, policy, and intervention efforts to 
      advance their health and food literacy agendas.

TI  - Group differences in health literacy are ameliorated in ehealth literacy.
PG  - 480-497
LID - 10.1080/21642850.2021.1926256 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heath literacy and eHealth literacy are skills that enable individuals 
      to seek, understand and use information in ways which promote and maintain health. 
      The present study examined group differences (ethnicity, immigration) in both 
      literacies and whether there exists an association between the literacies and 
      potential outcomes/gains in health behaviors, health care utilization, perceived 
      health and perceived outcomes of Internet search. METHODS: Participants included 819 
      Israeli men and women who responded to a nationally representative 
      random-digital-dial (RDD) telephone survey. Respondents were veteran Jews, 
      immigrants from the Former Soviet Union, and Palestinian Citizens of Israel. 
      RESULTS: Significant differences between the groups were found in health literacy, 
      especially in higher ordered skills, so that the immigrant group was the lowest, 
      after accounting for demographic variables. No significant group differences were 
      found in eHealth literacy. Health literacy was found to be significantly associated 
      with healthcare utilization, perceived health and perceived outcomes of Internet 
      search while eHealth literacy was associated with perceived health and perceived 
      outcomes of Internet search. No interaction was found between group and literacies 
      in the prediction of the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Immigration hampers health literacy 
      but differences are ameliorated in eHealth literacy. Finding on association between 
      literacies and outcomes replicated previous ones and the absence of moderation by 
      group attests to the robustness of the models on health literacies.

TI  - Health Literacy Assessment of Detained Individuals and Correctional Officers Within 
      a Large Urban Jail: Optimizing Health Education.
PG  - 84-90
LID - 10.1097/NCQ.0000000000000477 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little research has been done to address the health literacy level of 
      detained individuals and correctional officers. PURPOSE: The aim of this pilot 
      project was to describe the health literacy of individuals detained or working 
      within a large urban jail to inform their health education. METHODS: Health literacy 
      assessments were conducted using the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in 
      Medicine-Short Form (REALM-SF) and the Newest Vital Sign (NVS) tools. RESULTS: Of 
      the 48 participants, 17% (n = 8) exhibited low health literacy on the REALM-SF, 
      whereas 38% (n = 18) demonstrated the need for improved health literacy when 
      assessed with the NVS. Detained individuals from the women's tiers were more likely 
      to have lower health literacy than the detained veterans or correctional officers. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that tailored health education programming, using 
      evidence-based health literacy improvement techniques, should be offered to the 
      individuals detained or working within a correctional facility.

TI  - Health literacy impacts self-management, quality of life and fear of recurrence in 
      head and neck cancer survivors.
PG  - 855-865
LID - 10.1007/s11764-020-00978-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Little is known about whether health literacy is associated with affects 
      certain key outcomes in head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors. We investigated (i) 
      the socio-demographic and clinical profile of health literacy and (ii) associations 
      among between health literacy and self-management behaviours, health-related quality 
      of life (HRQL) and fear of recurrence (FoR) in HNC survivors. METHODS: A 
      population-based survey was conducted in Ireland. Health literacy was assessed using 
      a validated single-item question. Socio-demographic, clinical and psychosocial 
      outcome variables (FoR, self-management behaviours, HRQL) were collected. 
      Multivariable linear regression was performed to estimate associations between 
      health literacy and each psychosocial outcome. RESULTS: Three hundred ninety-five 
      (50%) individuals responded to the survey. Inadequate health literacy was evident 
      among 47% of the sample. In adjusted models, HNC survivors with inadequate health 
      literacy had significantly lower levels of self-management behaviours in the domains 
      of health-directed behaviour, positive and active engagement in life, 
      self-monitoring and insight, constructive attitudes and approaches and skills and 
      technique acquisition. Inadequate health literacy was independently associated with 
      lower functional well-being and HNC disease-specific HRQL. FoR was also 
      significantly higher among those with inadequate health literacy. CONCLUSIONS: HNC 
      survivors with inadequate health literacy have lower levels of self-management 
      behaviours, lower functional HRQL and increased FoR compared to those with adequate 
      health literacy. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Clinicians, healthcare providers 
      and those developing interventions should consider how inadequate health literacy 
      among HNC survivors might affect post-treatment outcomes when developing services 
      and providing support for this group.

TI  - Health Literacy in Pregnant Women: A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18073847 [doi]
LID - 3847
AB  - Health literacy plays a crucial role during pregnancy, as the mother's health 
      behavior influences both her own health and that of her child. To the authors' best 
      knowledge, no comprehensive overview on evidence of the health literacy of pregnant 
      women and its impact on health outcomes during pregnancy exists. Therefore, this 
      review aims to assess health literacy levels in pregnant women, whether health 
      literacy is associated with outcomes during pregnancy and whether effective 
      interventions exist to improve the health literacy of pregnant women. A systematic 
      literature search was conducted in PubMed and EBSCO, resulting in 14 studies. The 
      results show mixed levels of health literacy in pregnant women. Limited health 
      literacy is associated with unhealthy behaviors during pregnancy. Mixed health 
      literacy levels can be attributed to the recruitment site, the number of 
      participants and the measurement tool used. Quality assessment reveals that the 
      quality of the included studies is moderate to good. The review revealed that 
      randomized controlled trials and interventions to improve health literacy in 
      pregnant women are rare or do not exist. This is crucial in the light of the mixed 
      health literacy levels found among pregnant women. Healthcare providers play a key 
      role in this context, as pregnant women with limited health literacy rely on them as 
      sources of health information.

TI  - Associations Between Health Literacy, eHealth Literacy, and COVID-19-Related Health 
      Behaviors Among Chinese College Students: Cross-sectional Online Study.
PG  - e25600

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the internet has significantly spread 
      information, providing people with knowledge and advice about health protection 
      regarding COVID-19. While a previous study demonstrated that health and eHealth 
      literacy are related to COVID-19 prevention behaviors, few studies have focused on 
      the relationship between health literacy, eHealth literacy, and COVID-19-related 
      health behaviors. The latter includes not only preventative behaviors but also 
      conventional health behaviors. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop 
      and verify a COVID-19-related health behavior questionnaire, explore its status and 
      structure, and examine the associations between these behaviors and participants' 
      health literacy and eHealth literacy. METHODS: A snowball sampling method was 
      adopted to recruit participants to complete anonymous cross-sectional questionnaire 
      surveys online that assessed sociodemographic information, self-reported coronavirus 
      knowledge, health literacy, eHealth literacy, and COVID-19-related health behaviors. 
      RESULTS: Of 1873 college students who were recruited, 781 (41.7%) had adequate 
      health literacy; the mean eHealth literacy score was 30.16 (SD 6.31). The 
      COVID-19-related health behavior questionnaire presented a two-factor 
      structure-COVID-19-specific precautionary behaviors and conventional health 
      behaviors-with satisfactory fit indices and internal consistency (Cronbach α=.79). 
      The mean score of COVID-19-related health behaviors was 53.77 (SD 8.03), and scores 
      differed significantly (P<.05) with respect to residence, college year, academic 
      major, family economic level, self-reported health status, having a family member or 
      friend infected with coronavirus, and health literacy level. Linear regression 
      analysis showed that health literacy and eHealth literacy were positively associated 
      with COVID-19-specific precautionary behaviors (β(health literacy)=.149, β(eHealth 
      literacy)=.368; P<.001) and conventional health behaviors (β(health literacy)=.219, 
      β(eHealth literacy)=.277; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19-related health behavior 
      questionnaire was a valid and reliable measure for assessing health behaviors during 
      the pandemic. College students with higher health literacy and eHealth literacy can 
      more actively adopt COVID-19-related health behaviors. Additionally, compared to 
      health literacy, eHealth literacy is more closely related to COVID-19-related health 
      behaviors. Public intervention measures based on health and eHealth literacy are 
      required to promote COVID-19-related health behaviors during the pandemic, which may 
      be helpful to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection among college students.

TI  - Health literacy as a determinant of healthy eating and active living in Canadian 
      immigrant youth.
PG  - 406-416
LID - 10.1093/heapro/daaa053 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of the study was to explore health literacy and community engagement in 
      relation to active living with newcomer young people and their families. We employed 
      a case study design and a participatory approach. The data collected included 
      photovoice and photo-assisted focus group interviews, which included an initial 
      stage when youth participated in workshops creating collages on healthy living. A 
      follow-up focus group centred on discussion of the collages with subsequent training 
      on the photovoice method and the use of the cameras, and a second focus group, which 
      incorporated photos taken by participants during the programming and their leisure 
      time. Different themes were developed from the data: active living, balance, body 
      talk, challenges, environment and health, culture and health, family, health and 
      food, health and safety, knowledge, source of knowledge, peers and friends, personal 
      hygiene, recreational activities, socio-emotional health, social isolation and 
      spiritual health. Excerpts were taken from the different themes to demonstrate the 
      immigrant/refugee youths' understanding of levels of health literacy and its 
      contribution to healthy eating and active living. The qualitative findings are 
      presented under the different tenets of health literacy. Health literacy extends 
      beyond the individual level and effects the whole family and communities; 
      intervention need to extend to include community connections and involvement 
      activities. Future research needs to focus on the long-term effects of critical 
      health literacy among immigrant communities.

AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between health literacy 
      and diabetes self-care in individuals with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This 
      cross-sectional study was conducted with 207 individuals with Type 2 diabetes at a 
      diabetes outpatient clinic of a foundation university hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. 
      The data were collected using a sociodemographic and illness characteristics 
      questionnaire, the Turkish version of the European Health Literacy Survey 
      Questionnaire (HLS-EU-Q-TR), and the Diabetes Self-Care Scale (DSCS). Data were 
      analyzed using descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA, Student's t-test, Pearson 
      correlation test, and multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: It was found that 81.5% 
      of individuals with type 2 diabetes were at an inadequate or limited and problematic 
      level of health literacy. The DSCS mean scores of patients with an inadequate health 
      literacy level were significantly lower than that of patients at other levels of 
      health literacy. It was determined that education level, exercise status, and 
      HLS-EU-Q-TR scores were significantly related to diabetes self-care (R² = 0.245, p < 
      0.001). CONCLUSION: The study found that individuals with type 2 diabetes had higher 
      diabetes self-care if they had a high education level, regularly exercised, or had 
      high HLS-EU-Q-TR mean scores.

TI  - Exploring Health Literacy and the Correlates of Pap Testing Among African Immigrant 
      Women: Findings from the AfroPap Study.
PG  - 441-451
LID - 10.1007/s13187-020-01755-9 [doi]
AB  - African immigrant (AI) women have low rates of Pap testing. Health literacy plays a 
      pivotal role in health behaviors. Sources and types of health information could 
      shape health literacy and inform the Pap testing behaviors of AI women. However, the 
      influences of health literacy, sources, and types of health information along with 
      cultural and psychosocial correlates on the Pap testing behaviors of AI women are 
      poorly understood. To examine how sources and types of health information impact 
      health literacy, and in turn, how health literacy and cultural and psychosocial 
      factors influence the Pap testing behaviors of AI women. An adapted Health Literacy 
      Skills Framework guided the selection of variables for this cross-sectional study. 
      Convenience sampling was used to recruit 167 AI women, 21-65 years. Multivariate 
      logistic regression was used to assess correlates of Pap testing after adjusting for 
      covariates (age, education, English proficiency, employment, income, health 
      insurance, access to primary care, marital status, and healthcare provider 
      recommendation). Most participants (71%) had received a Pap test in the past and 
      used multiple (two or more) sources (65%) and types (57%) of health information. 
      Using multiple sources of health information (aOR 0.11, p < 0.01) but not types of 
      health information was associated with Pap testing. Having negative cultural beliefs 
      (aOR 0.17, p = 0.01) and having high self-efficacy (aOR 9.38, p < 0.01) were 
      significantly associated with Pap testing after adjusting for covariates. High 
      health literacy (OR 3.23, p < 0.05) and high decisional balance (OR 5.28, p < 0.001) 
      were associated with Pap testing in bivariate models but did not remain significant 
      after controlling for covariates. Cultural beliefs was a significant correlate of AI 
      women's Pap testing behaviors regardless of other known social determinants of 
      health (education, English proficiency, age, access to primary care). Disseminating 
      health information through various sources has the potential to promote Pap testing 
      among AI women. Larger studies which utilize a robust sampling strategy and include 
      a diverse group of AI women are needed in order to optimize health interventions 
      aimed at improving Pap test screening behaviors among AI women.

LID - 629334
AB  - Background: Health literacy is a determinant of health and assessed globally to 
      inform the development of health interventions. However, little is known about 
      health literacy in countries with one of the poorest health indicators worldwide, 
      such as Afghanistan. Studies worldwide demonstrate that women play a key role in 
      developing health literacy. Hence, this study's purpose is to explore health 
      literacy of women in Afghanistan and the associated factors. Methods: From May to 
      June 2017, we randomly recruited 7-10 women per day at the hospital in Ghazni, a 
      representative province of Afghanistan. Two trained female interviewers interviewed 
      322 women (15-61 years old) orally in Dari or Pashto on a voluntary basis and 
      assessed their health literacy using the HLS-EU-Q16, associated socio-demographics, 
      and health behavior. Results: Health literacy of women (among educated and 
      illiterates) is low even compared to other Asian countries. Health literacy is 
      linked to age and education. We found mixed evidence of the relationship between 
      health literacy and contextual factors, help-seeking, and health-related behavior. 
      Conclusion: This study provides novel data on health literacy and astonishing 
      insights into its association with health behavior of women in Afghanistan, thus 
      contributing to health status. The study calls for recognition of health literacy as 
      a public health challenge be addressed in Afghanistan and other low-income countries 
      affected by crises.

TI  - A pilot study of adolescent health literacy research in Melbourne: Implementation 
      and reflections.
PG  - 128-132
LID - 10.1002/hpja.425 [doi]
AB  - ISSUES ADDRESSED: While adolescent health literacy research has gained momentum, 
      there is little evidence regarding its implementation and data collection in school 
      settings. This study explored the feasibility of collecting health literacy data 
      from Australian secondary schools and piloted three health literacy instruments. 
      METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed to recruit four government secondary 
      schools in Melbourne. Active, opt-in consent was obtained from parents and students 
      in Years 7-9, and an online survey was conducted. Three health literacy instruments 
      were used: the 8-item Health Literacy Assessment Tool (HLAT-8), the Newest Vital 
      Sign (NVS), and the 47-item Health Literacy Survey (HLS-47). RESULTS: A total of 120 
      students (age 12-15 years) were finally recruited from one school, whereas the other 
      three schools declined due to busy educational commitment or no interest in 
      research. Learnings and reflections on data collection included: a shared 
      perspective of health literacy evaluation between school and researchers; the 
      feasibility of online data collection; and the possibility of obtaining passive, 
      opt-out consent. About one-quarter (23.7%-32.2%) of students were likely to have 
      poor health literacy. CONCLUSIONS: Although the recruitment was challenging, this 
      pilot study indicates the feasibility of large-scale online health literacy survey 
      in future school-based research. SO WHAT?: Measuring and monitoring adolescent 
      health literacy is essential to achieve the aim of the Australian Curriculum of 
      Health and Physical Education. More implementation research is needed with 
      representative samples to validate health literacy instruments and examine the 
      impact of health literacy on health promotion outcomes in Australian adolescents.

TI  - The Role of Health Literacy in Health Behavior, Health Service Use, Health Outcomes,

LID - 10.3390/ijerph182312464 [doi]
LID - 12464
AB  - About 8% of all children and adolescents worldwide are affected by chronic diseases. 
      Managing chronic conditions requires pediatric patients to be health literate. The 
      purpose of this review is to examine the existing evidence on the links between 
      health literacy and its outcomes proposed by the model by Sørensen et al. in 
      chronically ill pediatric patients. Four electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, 
      CINAHL, PsycINFO) were searched to identify pertinent articles published up to 
      November 2021. The search was conducted independently by two researchers and 
      restricted to observational studies. Of 11,137 initial results, 11 articles met 
      eligibility criteria. Overall, 6 studies identified a significant association 
      between health literacy and one of the considered outcomes. Regarding health 
      behavior, none of the studies on adherence found significant associations with 
      health literacy. The results in terms of health service use were inconclusive. 
      Regarding health outcomes, health literacy did not affect most physiological 
      parameters, but it significantly improved health-related quality of life. Overall, 
      evidence remains inconclusive but suggests that health literacy is associated with 
      self-efficacy, health-related quality of life, and health service use in pediatric 
      patients. Further research should be undertaken to strengthen the evidence.

TI  - Assessing health literacy among adult outpatients attending allied health clinics in 
      western sydney: A cross-sectional survey using a multidimensional instrument.
LID - 10.1002/hpja.456 [doi]
AB  - ISSUE ADDRESSED: Low health literacy disproportionately affects adults from 
      culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. This study investigated the 
      health literacy of adults attending outpatient allied health services in western 
      Sydney, a highly diverse region in Sydney with residents from a range of cultural 
      and linguistic backgrounds. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was undertaken between 
      March and April 2017 using the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ). Participants, 
      aged over 18 years and with a primary language of English, Arabic, Chinese or Hindi, 
      were recruited from outpatient allied health clinics at Westmead Hospital. Means 
      (standard deviation) for each of the nine HLQ domains were calculated and 
      associations with demographic variables were investigated using analysis of variance 
      (ANOVA). RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty people were included with mean age of 
      45.1 years (SD = 19.0), the majority were female (75.5%), over half were born 
      overseas (55.7%) and 77.6% reported speaking English at home. The highest mean score 
      on a HLQ domain (out of 5) was "Understanding health information well enough to know 
      what to do" (M = 4.19; SD = 0.67), and the lowest mean score (out of 4) was 
      "Appraisal of health information" (M = 2.97; SD = 0.54). Participants who did not 
      speak English at home had significantly lower scores on seven of the nine HLQ 
      domains. CONCLUSIONS: Important health literacy strengths and limitations of a 
      diverse sample of adults attending outpatient allied health services in western 
      Sydney were identified. Findings should be considered in the light of the 
      cross-sectional survey methodology with non-random sampling. SO WHAT: Data will 
      inform future interventions to improve health literacy and health outcomes among 
      vulnerable population groups in western Sydney.

TI  - A CHAT about health literacy - a qualitative feasibility study of the Conversational 
      Health Literacy Assessment Tool (CHAT) in a Danish municipal healthcare centre.
PG  - 1250-1258
LID - 10.1111/scs.12943 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding individual health literacy needs is crucial when designing 
      supportive and effective health care. However, tools assessing health literacy in 
      practice are lacking. The Conversational Health Literacy Assessment Tool (CHAT) was 
      recently developed, but its ability to assess health literacy remains unexplored. We 
      aimed to investigate the implementation and adoption of CHAT, its ability to 
      increase awareness of health literacy among healthcare providers, and if CHAT could 
      assess health literacy needs in patients. METHODS: We performed a qualitative 
      feasibility study of CHAT among healthcare providers (nurses, physiotherapists and 
      occupational therapists) who provide rehabilitation services for patients with 
      noncommunicable diseases in a municipal healthcare centre in Denmark. The study used 
      the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and 
      Maintenance) to structure interview guide and analysis. We collected qualitative 
      data from four small focus groups with healthcare providers (n = 11). The data were 
      analysed using a deductive thematic three-step method for organising and 
      interpreting data. All informants provided written informed consent prior to data 
      collection. RESULTS: CHAT seems to be a feasible and efficient tool for assessing 
      health literacy needs among individuals with different socio-demographic 
      characteristics and with different diagnoses. CHAT was easiest implemented and 
      adopted by healthcare providers, who were already familiarly with the concept of 
      health literacy. The informants emphasised that an introduction to CHAT and health 
      literacy as concept was valuable for the adoption. Some of them felt frustrated that 
      they did not have opportunity and options to meet the health literacy needs 
      identified by CHAT. CONCLUSIONS: CHAT is a promising tool for assessing individual 
      health literacy needs and increasing awareness of health literacy among healthcare 
      providers. For successfully implementation of CHAT, we recommend developing a 
      structured implementation programme, including an introduction to health literacy 
      and an outline of the options for acting upon CHAT results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The growing concern of low health literacy in populations combined with 
      the interest of companies to develop cultures of health and the emerging interest in 
      the workplace as an arena for improving health literacy is increasingly 
      acknowledged. This study aimed to explore how companies currently apply the concept 
      of health literacy as part of their health efforts in the work sphere. METHODS: A 
      systematic literature review was conducted based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting 
      Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis) guidelines. The search was performed 
      in the databases PubMed, Science Direct, and Directory of Open Access Journals from 
      July 2019 to August 2019 and included the search terms "health literacy," "health 
      literate," and "health competence" combined with the search terms 
      "company/companies," "corporation/corporates," "workplace," "business," and 
      "organization." Studies were eligible for inclusion if they (1) were written in 
      English or German, (2) were concerned with employers/employees, companies, 
      corporations, or organizations, (3) dealt with health literacy in particular, and 
      (4) were formatted as journal articles, systematic literature reviews, or book 
      chapters. KEY RESULTS: The search identified 20 articles. A thematic analysis 
      resulted in 5 clusters with 2 to 3 sub-themes illustrating the characteristics of 
      how corporations apply health literacy. The clusters entailed the conceptualization 
      of health literacy, its measurement, and the application of health literacy in 
      strategies, interventions, and training. DISCUSSION: The literature review reveals 
      that the application of health literacy by companies is in its infancy. More 
      research and practical experience are warranted on how companies can mobilize and 
      facilitate a health literate workforce. [HLRP: Health Literacy Research and 
      Practice. 2021;5(3):e218-e225.] Plain Language Summary: This literature study 
      explored the role of advancing health literacy in companies. Five aspects were 
      identified as important, including the understanding of the concept, its 
      measurement, and its integration into strategies, interventions, and training. The 
      involvement of management and the staff was crucial for success.

TI  - Effects of mHealth-based interventions on health literacy and related factors: A 
      systematic review.
PG  - 385-394
LID - 10.1111/jonm.13175 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the effects of mobile health (mHealth)-based interventions on 
      health literacy and related factors. BACKGROUND: Few reviews exist on the effects of 
      mHealth-based interventions on the improvement and changes in health literacy and 
      related factors. EVALUATION: A systematic review was conducted using the Mixed 
      Methods Appraisal Tool to evaluate the quality of articles. RESULTS: Outcome 
      variables included eHealth literacy, mHealth literacy and health literacy. Two 
      studies showed that health literacy was significantly enhanced after mHealth 
      application use, particularly among those with low education and health literacy 
      levels. Two articles reported that health information seeking and health information 
      appraisal improved after mHealth-based interventions, thereby increasing health 
      literacy levels. In one article, no significant relationship was found between 
      health literacy levels and mHealth literacy. CONCLUSION: mHealth can enhance health 
      literacy; furthermore, mobile applications effectively improve patient health 
      literacy. However, measurement tools used for evaluating health literacy indicators 
      are inconsistent, with the concept and components of these tools being not 
      specifically designed for evaluating health literacy indicators. IMPLICATIONS FOR 
      NURSING MANAGEMENT: To successfully and effectively overcome health problems in 
      diverse clinical settings, the theory-based mHealth services should be adopted while 
      considering their intensity, frequency, duration and credibility.

TI  - Association between health literacy and physical activity in older people: a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1482-1497
LID - 10.1093/heapro/daaa072 [doi]
AB  - Physical inactivity is common in older people and contributes to morbidity and 
      mortality. Health literacy might play a role in motivating people to become or stay 
      physically active. However, little is known about the influence of health literacy 
      on physical activity in older people. This review aims to determine the association 
      between health literacy and physical activity in older people. A systematic search 
      was conducted in CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsychINFO and CENTRAL. Inclusion criteria: (i) 
      community-dwelling people with an average age of ≥55 and (ii) reported on the 
      association between health literacy and physical activity. Exclusion criteria: (i) 
      population with a health condition and (ii) case study or qualitative study. Data 
      were extracted independently by two reviewers. Risk of bias was assessed using the 
      Downs and Black checklist. A meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects models 
      with inverse variance. Thirteen articles were included in the review and five 
      articles were selected for the meta-analysis. Older people with inadequate health 
      literacy were 38% less likely than older people with adequate health literacy to 
      report engaging in physical activity on ≥5 days per week [odds ratio = 0.62, 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 0.55-0.77]. Only two articles used activity monitors; the 
      mean number of steps taken per day was not significantly different between older 
      people with adequate and inadequate health literacy (standardized mean difference = 
      -0.15, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.01). Physical activity could potentially be fostered by 
      increasing health literacy and empowering older people to make beneficial health 
      decisions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients' ability to self-monitor symptoms and engage in self-care 
      activities is dependent upon their level of health literacy. Health literacy and 
      self-care ability was compared in men with prostate cancer undergoing radiotherapy 
      that used an app for symptom management with a control group. METHODS: Included were 
      an intervention group (n = 66), who used an app for symptom reporting and support 
      for self-care, and a control group (n = 64). Outcomes were Functional Health 
      Literacy, Communicative and Critical Health Literacy and Appraisal of Self-Care 
      Agency (ASA-A). RESULTS: The intervention group had improved regarding "ability to 
      select information needed from a variety of information sources" (p = .020), 
      "ability to determine the information credible" (p = .041), and "being able to plan 
      and decide what to do to improve health" (p = .004). No inter-group difference was 
      found for ASA-A. CONCLUSIONS: With the support of an app for reporting and managing 
      symptoms, important advanced health literacy skills of selecting, determining, and 
      judging information credible may improve. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Patients undergoing 
      treatment for prostate cancer may benefit from an individualized approach, such as 
      an app, for communication with health care providers and as a source of health 
      information to make decisions about their own health.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Communication failures are the leading root cause of safety events. 
      Although much communication research focuses on the healthcare team, there is little 
      focus on communication with patients and families. It is not known what deficits in 
      health literate patient communication lead to patient safety events. We aimed to 
      identify themes of health literacy-related safety events to describe the impact of 
      health literate communication on patient safety. METHODS: The safety events were 
      entered into a system-wide self-reported safety event collection database. A patient 
      safety specialist trained in health literacy prospectively tagged events for health 
      literacy. The authors retrospectively queried the database for all health literacy 
      tagged events during 9 months (September 2017-May 2018). The authors reviewed and 
      independently coded health literacy-associated safety events. Qualitative content 
      analysis of events facilitated by software (NVivo) was completed to identify the 
      health literacy-related safety event themes. RESULTS: Health literacy events 
      comprised 4% (152/3911) of self-reported safety events during the 9 months. Main 
      themes of the health literacy safety events related to (1) medication; (2) system 
      processes; and (3) discharge/transition. Subthemes of each of the events further 
      described the event types. Health literacy-associated safety events encompass all 
      safety event outcomes (near miss, precursor, and serious safety events). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Health literacy-related safety events occur in the healthcare 
      environment. This review characterizing health literacy-related safety events 
      prioritizes areas to implement health literate safety practices. Many opportunities 
      exist to address communication-related safety events around medication, system 
      processes, and discharge using health literate best practices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Decision-makers and health professionals face challenges in providing 
      quality medical services while optimizing diminishing resources. Health literacy is 
      associated with health outcomes and health system costs and influences the way in 
      which communication is managed in the health system. OBJECTIVE: This study examined 
      the association between the level of health literacy of service providers in the 
      community, their awareness of health literacy, their attitudes toward health 
      literacy promotion, and the way in which they communicate with patients with low 
      health literacy. METHODS: A cross-sectional analytic study was conducted among 50 
      physicians and 50 administrative staff members in community clinics of the Maccabi 
      Health Maintenance Organization in Israel. KEY RESULTS: Significant positive 
      associations were found (p < .05) between the level of health literacy, the 
      attitudes toward health literacy promotion, and the degree to which special 
      communication techniques were used when treating patients with low health literacy. 
      Significant associations were found (p < .01) between the level of awareness, as 
      well as the attitudes toward health literacy promotion and the degree to which 
      communication techniques were applied. Higher health literacy is associated with 
      more favorable attitudes toward health literacy promotion. Additionally, a 
      significant positive association (p < .01) was found between the attitudes toward 
      health literacy promotion and the use of communication techniques. No mediation was 
      found among the research variables. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this 
      is the first study that examines health literacy among physicians. The results 
      indicate gaps in the awareness of, and attitudes toward, health literacy among 
      community health care providers, thus suggesting the need for developing and 
      applying guidelines for improving efforts of health system providers regarding 
      health literacy and for applying recommended tools for health communication. [HLRP: 
      Health Literacy Research and Practice. 2021;5(3):e194-e200.] Plain Language Summary: 
      This study examined the link between the health literacy of health care providers 
      (e.g., physicians, service administrators), their awareness and attitudes toward 
      health literacy promotion, and how they communicate with patients with low health 
      literacy. The findings showed significant and positive relationships between these 
      aspects of health literacy as well as gaps in the health care system that need to be 
      addressed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health literacy has been concerned a key factor for determining the use 
      of health information and promoting health. The study aimed to explore adolescent 
      health literacy, health-promoting lifestyle profile, and health status and related 
      factors. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used; 918 first year junior 
      college students were recruited in Taiwan. The measurements were the Chinese Health 
      Literacy Survey Questionnaire (HLS-C-Q), the Chinese Health-Promoting Lifestyle 
      Profile (HPLP-S), and the Health Status Questionnaire. RESULTS: The mean score for 
      health literacy was 36.15 (±6.21), with 30.17% of the participants having 
      insufficient or problematic health literacy. Further, 19.9% of participants were 
      obese and 11.2% experienced emotional instability. Health literacy and 
      health-promoting lifestyle profile showed significant positive and negative 
      correlations with perceived health status and depression, respectively (p < 0.05). 
      An exercise frequency of ≥3 times/week was a predictor of health literacy, 
      health-promoting lifestyle profile, and emotional stability. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent 
      health literacy, health-promoting lifestyle profile, and health status require 
      careful consideration. In adolescents, developing regular exercise may increase 
      health literacy, thereby developing healthy lifestyle profiles and ameliorating 
      obesity and depression-related issues.

TI  - Health literacy and health outcomes in patients with low back pain: a scoping 
      review.
PG  - 215

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Health 
      literacy has been associated with pain intensity and pain control. However, there is 
      a paucity of evidence regarding this association. In the field of low back pain 
      research, inconsistent reporting of outcomes has been highlighted. To address this 
      issue a Core Outcome Set has been developed. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this 
      scoping review were: (1) The health literacy measures currently employed for low 
      back pain and the aspects of health literacy they include. (2) The low back pain 
      health outcomes included in such work. (3) The extent to which these health outcomes 
      reflect the Core Outcome Set for Clinical Trials in Non-Specific Low Back Pain. 
      METHODS: The search included thirteen bibliographic databases, using medical subject 
      heading terms for low back pain and health literacy, and followed the Preferred 
      Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping 
      Reviews guidelines. The eligibility criteria were defined by the Joanna Briggs 
      Institute PCC mnemonic. A thematic framework approach was used for analysis. 
      RESULTS: The search yielded ten relevant studies for inclusion, amongst which a 
      total of nine health literacy measures and 50 health outcome measures were used. 
      Most health literacy measures focused on functional health literacy, with few 
      assessing communicative and critical health literacy. The health outcomes assessed 
      by the included studies could be broadly categorised into: Pain, Disability, 
      Behaviour, Knowledge and Beliefs, and Resource Utilisation. Most of these outcome 
      measures studied (36 out of 50) did not directly reflect the Core Outcome Set for 
      Clinical Trials in Non-Specific Low Back Pain. CONCLUSIONS: To allow for comparison 
      across findings and the development of a rigorous evidence base, future work should 
      include the Core Outcome Set for Clinical Trials in Non-Specific Low Back Pain. 
      There is an urgent need to broaden the evidence-base to include regions where low 
      back pain morbidity is high, but data is lacking. Such work demands the 
      incorporation of comprehensive measures of health literacy that have both generic 
      and culturally sensitive components.

LID - 10.3760/cma.j.cn121094-20200105-000011 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To explore the relationship between the health literacy of employees and 
      smoking, drinking, diet and exercise, and provide scientific basis for health 
      education and targeted intervention. Methods: From February to July 2019, a cluster 
      random sampling method was adopted to select enterprise employees in Shihezi City to 
      conduct a questionnaire survey. Self-made questionnaires and "National Resident 
      Health Literacy Monitoring Questionnaire" were used to assess the social 
      demographics, health literacy, and Health-related behaviors were investigated, and 
      1053 valid questionnaires were collected. Logistic regression model was used to 
      analyze the relationship between health literacy and the three dimensions with 
      smoking, drinking, diet and exercise. Results: Total score of health literacy of 
      enterprise employees is (42.06±11.03) points and the employee health literacy rate 
      of Shihezi City in 2019 is 19.47%. Univariate analysis showed that non-smokers had 
      higher health literacy and three-dimensional health literacy availability than 
      smokers (P<0.01) ; fewer drinkers had higher health literacy availability than 
      overdrinkers (P<0.05) ; balanced diet health literacy availability The health 
      literacy availability rates in the three dimensions were higher than those in the 
      unbalanced diet (P<0.01) . In the logistic regression analysis, healthy lifestyle 
      and behavioral literacy were independently related to smoking behavior (OR=1.571, 
      P<0.05) ; the presence of health literacy and the three dimensions of health 
      literacy were not statistically related to alcohol consumption (P>0.05) ; there is a 
      statistical correlation between health literacy, healthy lifestyles, behaviors, and 
      health skills and regular exercise among employees (OR=1.829、2.503、1.395, P<0.05) ; 
      employees with health literacy and three dimensions of health literacy are more 
      likely to have a balanced diet (P<0.01) . Conclusion: There is a correlation between 
      the health literacy of enterprise employees and diet and exercise. The improvement 
      of health literacy level is an important way to interfere with unhealthy behaviors.

      Cross-sectional Study.
PG  - e14088

LID - e14088
AB  - BACKGROUND: The internet has emerged as a main venue of health information delivery 
      and health-related activities. However, few studies have examined how health 
      literacy determines online health-related behavior. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study 
      was to investigate the current level of health-related information-seeking using the 
      internet and how health literacy, access to technology, and sociodemographic 
      characteristics impact health-related information-seeking behavior. METHODS: We 
      conducted a cross-sectional study through a survey with Minnesotan adults (N=614) to 
      examine their health literacy, access to technology, and health-related 
      information-seeking internet use. We used multivariate regression analysis to assess 
      the relationship between health-related information-seeking on the internet and 
      health literacy and access to technology, controlling for sociodemographic 
      characteristics. RESULTS: Better health literacy (β=.35, SE 0.12) and greater access 
      to technological devices (eg, mobile phone and computer or tablet PC; β=.06, SE 
      0.19) were both associated with more health-related information-seeking behavior on 
      the internet after adjusting for all other sociodemographic characteristics. 
      Possession of a graduate degree (β=.28, SE 0.07), female gender (β=.15, SE 0.05), 
      poor health (β=.22, SE 0.06), participation in social groups (β=.13, SE 0.05), and 
      having an annual health exam (β=.35, SE 0.12) were all associated with online 
      health-related information-seeking. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that access 
      to online health-related information is not uniformly distributed throughout the 
      population, which may exacerbate disparities in health and health care. Research, 
      policy, and practice attention are needed to address the disparities in access to 
      health information as well as to ensure the quality of the information and improve 
      health literacy.

TI  - Challenging the association between health literacy and health: the role of 
      conversion factors.
LID - daab054 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/heapro/daab054 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies have found substantial correlations between health literacy and 
      various health outcomes. However, the role of social and personal factors in those 
      links remains understudied. Applying a moderation approach, we assume that these 
      factors function as conversion factors on the associations between health literacy 
      and health outcomes. Consequently, we test if associations between health literacy 
      and health outcomes are stronger among young male adults who score high in 
      conversion factors compared to those who score low. Cross-sectional data from the 
      Young Adult Survey Switzerland were used for the analyses (n = 9339, age = 18-25). 
      Multiple logistic regression analyses were applied to estimate associations between 
      health literacy and health. Moderator analyses with three conversion factors and 
      five health outcomes were conducted. For each health outcome at least one conversion 
      factor moderated the association between health literacy and health according to the 
      hypothesis. Although strength and form of the moderation effect differ across 
      analyses, generally stronger associations were found among groups with beneficial 
      social or personal factors. The present findings support the hypothesis that 
      conversion factors play a crucial role in the associations between health literacy 
      and health. The findings, thus, point towards a potential risk of linear health 
      literacy approaches that assume equal benefits from increased health literacy. 
      Individuals with beneficial social and personal factors (those already privileged) 
      may enjoy greater health benefits from interventions improving health literacy.

AB  - (1) Background: The start of vocational education is a challenge for many people 
      whose careers are just beginning. The working conditions exact new physical and 
      mental tolls that can have an impact on their state of health and health behavior. 
      Well-developed health literacy helps to encourage greater self-responsibility with 
      respect to health and safety in the workplace. This study aimed to contribute to the 
      evolution of health-related interventions in vocational training and instruction. 
      (2) Methodology: This cross-sectional study examined health literacy, health 
      behavior, and states of health among trainees engaged in work-and-study vocational 
      training in 11 professions at the start of their education courses in northern 
      Germany. The data were collected using a paper and pencil format. (3) Results: The 
      survey was approved by 47 vocational schools (response rate 14%), with 1797 trainees 
      returning their questionnaires (response rate 36%). The average age of the overall 
      cohort was 21, and 70% of the trainees were female. A total of 47% of the 
      participants began their careers with sufficient health literacy; health literacy 
      was problematic in 40% of cases, and inadequate in 13% of cases. Around 50% of 
      trainees exhibited poor dietary regime and risky alcohol intake, while 58% reported 
      having a medical condition that had been previously formally diagnosed. (4) 
      Conclusion: There is a need to provide support for developing a healthier approach 
      to work at the start of vocational training.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease and dialysis are associated with various 
      complications. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the relationship between 
      health literacy and quality of life among patients receiving hemodialysis in 
      hospitals affiliated with Tehran University of Medical Sciences. METHODS: In this 
      study, a descriptive - correlational study design with 138 sample size was used. 
      Convenience sampling was used to select the study participants. We collected the 
      data on May-September 2019. Data collection was done using the HELIA and KDQOL SF™. 
      RESULTS: In this study, 133 respondents fully completed the questioners. The mean 
      score of health literacy of the respondents was 49.03 (± 22.37) while the average 
      score of quality of life of the respondents in this study was 53.01 (± 14.86). 
      CONCLUSION: Based on the findings, patients receiving haemodialysis had insufficient 
      health literacy and a better quality of life. In order to address the health 
      literacy needs of the patients, consideration of continuous health education and 
      assessment in this patient subpopulation could gradually improve their health 
      literacy and quality of life. Health care providers such as nurses could improve 
      Health Literacy and substantially Quality of Life through interventions aimed at 
      determining existing literacy needs in the long and short term treatment course for 
      individual dialysis patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health literacy, social support and self-efficacy are important concepts 
      in mothers of preterm neonates. The purpose of study was to determine the 
      association between health literacy, social support and self-efficacy of mothers of 
      preterm neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. METHODS: This 
      descriptive correlational study was conducted from November 2017 to January 2019 on 
      200 mothers of preterm neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of 
      selected hospitals affiliated with Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, 
      Iran. Data were collected using demographic, maternal health literacy, maternal 
      self-efficacy and multidimensional scale of perceived social support questionnaires. 
      Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) and 
      inferential tests (Pearson correlation coefficient) using SPSS-PC (v.23) and R 
      software. RESULTS: The data showed 23.5% of mothers had high likelihood of low 
      health literacy, 45.5% had possibility of low health literacy and 31% had adequate 
      with mean score 2.57 ± 1.28. Also, 9.5% of participants had low perceived social 
      support, 62.5% moderate perceived social support and 28% high perceived social 
      support. Maternal self-efficacy score was 52.54 ± 8.06. Pearson's correlation 
      coefficient analyses revealed a statistically significant positive correlation 
      between maternal health literacy and social support (r = 0.304, p < .001). Also 
      maternal health literacy was positively correlated with the self-efficacy 
      (r = 0.292, p < .001) and self-efficacy was positively correlated with social 
      support (r = 0.440, p < .001). CONCLUSION: Health literacy, social support and 
      self-efficacy of mothers of preterm neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care 
      unit in Iran are related together. Therefore, neonatal care nurses need to note this 
      in care of this clients and adopt strategies to enhance them.

TI  - Inverse Association Between Health Literacy and Obesity Among Children in Greece: A 
      School-Based, Cross-Sectional Epidemiological Study.
PG  - 1090198120982944
LID - 10.1177/1090198120982944 [doi]
AB  - Children's health literacy is a crucial pillar of health. This study is aimed to 
      examine the association between health literacy and weight status among Greek 
      schoolchildren aged 10 to 12 years old. A population-based, cross-sectional 
      observational study enrolling 1,728 students (795 boys), aged 10 to 12 years old, 
      was conducted during school years 2014-2016. A health literacy index (range 0-100) 
      was created through an item response theory hybrid model, by combining a variety of 
      beliefs and perceptions of children about health. The mean health literacy score was 
      70.4 (±18.7). The majority of children (63.8%) had a "high" level (i.e., >67/100) of 
      health literacy, 30.5% had a "medium" level (i.e., 34-66/100) of health literacy, 
      while a small proportion of children (5.7%) had a "low" level (i.e., <33/100). Girls 
      exhibited a higher level of health literacy than boys (71.7 ± 18.3 vs. 68.8 ± 19.1, 
      p < .01). Regarding body weight status, 21.7% of children was overweight and 5.0% 
      was obese. Linear regression models showed that the health literacy score was 
      inversely associated with children's body mass index (regression coefficient [95% 
      CI]: -0.010 [-0.018, -0.001]), after adjusting for dietary habits, physical activity 
      levels, and other potential confounders. Health literacy seems to be a dominant 
      characteristic of children's weight status; therefore, school planning, as well as 
      public health policy actions should emphasize on the ability of children's capacity 
      to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.

AB  - THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES: Children with medical complexity experience negative health 
      outcomes despite the high costs associated with their care. There is growing 
      evidence that low parental health literacy is associated with a number of poor child 
      health outcomes, including medication errors. However, less is known about the 
      relationship between parental health literacy and the health outcomes of children 
      with medical complexity, whose care is known to be more complex and demanding of 
      parents. PHENOMENA ADDRESSED: The challenges faced by parents of children with 
      medical complexity are presented, including those related to communication, care 
      coordination, and medication administration. The historical and theoretical 
      perspectives of health literacy are discussed, and the relationship of parental 
      health literacy to pediatric health outcomes for children with medical complexity is 
      explored. RESEARCH LINKAGES: Remaining knowledge gaps about parental health literacy 
      and its influence on the health of children with medical complexity are outlined. 
      Future research and clinical practice implications of health literacy and its 
      importance to family-centered care are discussed.

TI  - Building health literacy system capacity: a framework for health literate systems.
PG  - i13-i23
LID - 10.1093/heapro/daab153 [doi]
AB  - The human and social implications of poor health literacy are substantial and 
      wide-ranging. Health literacy represents the personal competencies and 
      organizational structures, resources and commitment that enable people to access, 
      understand, appraise and use information and services in ways that promote and 
      maintain good health. A large-scale societal improvement of health literacy will 
      require political buy-in and a systematic approach to the development of health 
      literacy capacity at all levels. This article builds the case for enhancing health 
      literacy system capacity and presents a framework with eight action areas to 
      accommodate the structural transformation needed at micro, meso and macro levels, 
      including a health literate workforce, health literate organization, health literacy 
      data governance, people-centred services and environments based on user engagement, 
      health literacy leadership, health literacy investments and financial resources, 
      health literacy-informed technology and innovation, and partnerships and 
      inter-sectoral collaboration. Investment in the health literacy system capacity 
      ensures an imperative and systemic effort and transformation which can be multiplied 
      and sustained over time and is resilient towards external trends and events, rather 
      than relying on organizational and individual behavioural change alone. 
      Nevertheless, challenges still remain, e.g. to specify the economic benefits more in 
      detail, develop and integrate data governance systems and go beyond healthcare to 
      engage in health literacy system capacity within a wider societal context.

OAB - Health literacy represents the personal competencies and organizational structures 
      and resources enabling people to access, understand, appraise and use information 
      and services in ways that promote and maintain good health. To meet the needs 
      related to impact of poor health literacy, this article introduces a framework for 
      the development of health literacy system capacity with eight action areas including 
      the development of a health literate workforce, health literate organization, health 
      literacy data governance, people-centred services and environments based on user 
      engagement, health literacy leadership, health literacy investments and financial 
      resources, health literacy-informed technology and innovation, and partnerships and 
      inter-sectoral collaboration. Investment in health literacy system capacity ensures 
      a future-proof effort that can be multiplied and sustained over time, rather than 
      relying on organizational or individual behavioural change alone.

TI  - Which criteria characterize a health literate health care organization? - a scoping 
      review on organizational health literacy.
PG  - 664
LID - 10.1186/s12913-021-06604-z [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Organizational health literacy (OHL) aims to respond to the health 
      literacy needs of patients by improving health information and services and making 
      them easier to understand, access, and apply. This scoping review primarily maps 
      criteria characterizing health literate health care organizations. Secondary 
      outcomes are the concepts and terminologies underlying these criteria as well as 
      instruments to measure them. METHODS: The review was carried out following the JBI 
      Manual on scoping reviews. The databases CINAHL, Cochrane Library, JSTOR, PsycINFO, 
      PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, and Wiley Online Library were searched in 
      July 2020. Three researchers screened the records and extracted the data. The 
      results were synthesized systematically and descriptively. RESULTS: The literature 
      search resulted in 639 records. After removing duplicates, screening by title and 
      abstract, and assessing full-texts for eligibility, the scoping review included 60 
      publications. Criteria for OHL were extracted and assigned to six main categories 
      (with 25 subcategories). The most prevalent topic of organizational health literacy 
      refers to communication with service users. Exemplary criteria regarding this main 
      category are the education and information of service users, work on 
      easy-to-understand written materials as well as oral exchange, and verifying 
      understanding. The six main categories were defined as 1) communication with service 
      users; 2) easy access & navigation; 3) integration & prioritization of OHL; 4) 
      assessments & organizational development; 5) engagement & support of service users, 
      and 6) information & qualification of staff. The criteria were based on various 
      concepts and terminologies. Terminologies were categorized into four conceptual 
      clusters: 1) health literacy in various social contexts; 2) health literate health 
      care organization; 3) organizational behavior, and 4) communication in health care. 
      17 different assessment tools and instruments were identified. Only some of the 
      toolkits and instruments were validated or tested in feasibility studies. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Organizational health literacy includes a significant number of 
      distinct organizational criteria. The terminologies used in the OHL literature are 
      heterogeneous based on a variety of concepts. A comprehensive, consensus-based 
      conceptual framework on OHL is missing.

TI  - Dissonances in communication with sexual health consumers in an inner-Sydney sexual 
      health clinic in relation to health literacy: A mixed-methods study.
PG  - 133-142
LID - 10.1002/hpja.429 [doi]
AB  - ISSUES ADDRESSED: This study examined the navigation of health care interactions by 
      health consumers attending Sydney Sexual Health Centre (SSHC), an inner-city sexual 
      health clinic in Sydney, Australia. We aimed to assess the accessibility and 
      appropriateness of communications between SSHC and patients in the context of health 
      literacy. METHODS: We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with health consumers, 
      assessed health literacy using the Short Health Literacy Assessment for 
      English-Speaking Adults (SAHL-E) and conducted a focus group with clinical staff. 
      RESULTS: We identified dissonances around assumed knowledge in communications 
      between health professionals and health consumers, which were most apparent when 
      lack of knowledge about sexual health, HIV and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) 
      intersected with poor English fluency. SO WHAT?: This study suggests that existing 
      models of access for HIV treatment and PrEP in Australia have been developed for 
      high health literacy and may not support consumers who experience communication 
      barriers due to low health literacy. The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality 
      in Health Care recommends addressing health literacy systemically, including 
      embedding assessment of health literacy into organisational systems and policies. We 
      recommend developing tools to assess knowledge levels of consumers accessing sexual 
      health services and incorporating health literacy into clinician training on working 
      with patients from non-English-speaking backgrounds.

TI  - Associations between health-related skills and young adults' work ability within a 
      structural health literacy model.
PG  - 1072-1083
LID - 10.1093/heapro/daaa099 [doi]
AB  - Young adults have a high societal relevance but are still an under-represented 
      target group in health promotion. Health literacy is widely acknowledged as one of 
      the strongest predictors and key determinant of health, so its influence on work 
      ability is of great interest. The purpose of the study was to examine the 
      associations between health-related skills and work ability within the structural 
      model of health literacy of Lenartz, Soellner and colleagues, which explains health 
      behaviour and health through the indirect and direct influence of six 'advanced 
      skills' ('self-perception', 'proactive approach to health', 'dealing with health 
      information', 'self-control', 'self-regulation' and 'communication and 
      cooperation'). The cross-sectional study was based on baseline data of a health 
      literacy promotion intervention (495 vocational school students, 59.0% female, age 
      span 18-25 years). Structural equation modelling with partial least squares was used 
      to examine the associations between the six constructs of the model and the Work 
      Ability Index (WAI). Mean WAI score was 39.7 ± 4.5 (51.1% categorized 
      'moderate'/'poor'). Five out of six constructs of the model showed a statistically 
      significant indirect or direct effect, respectively, on work ability. The model 
      explained 24.8% of the WAI score variance. Our findings show associations between 
      the health literacy model and the work ability among young employees. In view of 
      demographic change, it is crucial to develop and analyse target group-specific 
      health literacy interventions. The model offers new facets in the modelling of 
      health literacy.

TI  - Improving Patient Health Literacy in Hospitals - A Challenge for Hospital Health 
      Education Programs.
PG  - 4415-4424
LID - 10.2147/RMHP.S332220 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The health literacy of hospital patients has become a very important 
      issue, especially in the face of emerging infectious diseases. The design of and 
      measures used by hospitals, however, have not yet taken into account whether 
      patients can develop their health literacy through the process of medical treatment. 
      Hospitals should take on this role as part of health education programs. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional survey was conducted at pre-admission testing center patients 
      waiting to be hospitalized in a regional teaching hospital. A purposive sampling 
      method was used to recruit 406 patients via self-administered questionnaires. 
      RESULTS: Among the 406 participants, 36.1% had adequate health literacy. There were 
      significant differences in age, education attainment, and history of chronic 
      diseases for health literacy. The ability to find and judge information on health 
      was lower. Watching health-related TV programs was positively correlated with health 
      literacy. Health literacy, health promotion literacy, and understanding information 
      on health were positively correlated to self-care and management. 65.8% of patients 
      did not understand the treatment for which they were being admitted. Health 
      literacy, healthcare health literacy, the ability to judge health information were 
      positively related to understanding the treatment. CONCLUSION: Health literacy is a 
      critical facilitating factor in improving self-care and management and understanding 
      treatment on admission. Health education programs cannot, however, be 
      one-size-fits-all. To help patients change their behavior, the change must be made 
      easy. To this end, health information in the form of entertainment programs and 
      simplified materials may be useful and even necessary.

PG  - 144-153
LID - 10.1097/PHH.0000000000001050 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Low health literacy has been associated with unfavorable health outcomes. 
      We examined diabetes self- and clinical care measures among adults with diabetes by 
      3 dimensions of health literacy. DESIGN/SETTING: Questions about health literacy 
      were available for optional use in the 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance 
      System. We analyzed 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data from 4 
      states and the District of Columbia that had included both the Health Literacy and 
      Diabetes optional modules. PARTICIPANTS: Respondents who participated in the 2016 
      Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, 
      Virginia, and Washington, District of Columbia, and completed both modules (n = 
      4397). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Health literacy was measured by level of difficulty 
      (easy, difficult) with 3 health literacy tasks: getting health advice or 
      information, understanding health information delivered orally by health 
      professionals, and understanding written health information. Diabetes care measures 
      included physical activity, self-monitoring blood glucose, self-checking feet, 
      hemoglobin A1c testing, professional foot examination, flu vaccination, professional 
      eye examination, dental visits, and diabetes self-management education. RESULTS: 
      Among those with self-reported diabetes, 5.9% found it difficult to get health 
      advice or information, 10.7% found it difficult to understand information health 
      professionals told them, and 12.0% found it difficult to understand written health 
      information. Those who found it difficult to get health advice or information had 
      44% to 56% lower adjusted odds of A1c testing, professional foot examinations, and 
      dental visits; those who found it difficult to understand written health information 
      had lower odds of self-monitoring glucose and self-checking feet. Difficulty 
      understanding both oral and written health information was associated with never 
      having taken a diabetes self-management class. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that 
      problems with health literacy may be a barrier to good disease management among 
      adults with diabetes and that health care providers should be attentive to the needs 
      of patients with low health literacy, especially for diabetes-specific specialty 
      care.

AB  - AIM: This study aimed to determine the electronic health (e-health) literacy level 
      of high school students and its relationship with their health-promoting behaviours. 
      METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted between April and May 2018. The 
      study sample consisted of 409 students, who were aged between 14 and 19 years old, 
      in three high schools located in the city centre of Denizli. Multiple regression 
      analyses were performed to examine the predictive variables for six dimensions of 
      health-promoting behaviours. RESULTS: In this study, the mean (SD) e-health literacy 
      score of 27.89 (6.19) was slightly above moderate level. e-Health literacy was found 
      to significantly predict all six dimensions of health-promoting behaviours 
      positively, that is, e-health literacy was determined to predict the dimensions of 
      nutritional behaviours (β = 0.64, P < 0.001), life appreciation (β = 0.55, P < 
      0.001), social support (β = 0.72, P < 0.001), exercise (β = 0.36, P < 0.001), stress 
      management (β = -0.22, P < 0.001) and health responsibility (β = 0.68, P < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSION: With e-health literacy significantly predictive of health-promoting 
      behaviours, nurses are recommended to consider the e-health literacy levels of 
      adolescents in the health-promoting programs they design.

TI  - Effects of Objective and Subjective Health Literacy on Patients' Accurate Judgment 
      of Health Information and Decision-Making Ability: Survey Study.
PG  - e20457
LID - 10.2196/20457 [doi]
LID - e20457
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interpreting health information and acquiring health knowledge have 
      become more important with the accumulation of scientific medical knowledge and 
      ideals of patient autonomy. Health literacy and its tremendous success as a concept 
      can be considered an admission that not all is well in the distribution of health 
      knowledge. The internet makes health information much more easily accessible than 
      ever, but it introduces its own problems, of which health disinformation is a major 
      one. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether objective and 
      subjective health literacy are independent concepts and to test which of the two was 
      associated more strongly with accurate judgments of the quality of a medical website 
      and with behavioral intentions beneficial to health. METHODS: A survey on depression 
      and its treatments was conducted online (n=362). The Newest Vital Sign was employed 
      to measure objective, performance-based health literacy, and the eHealth Literacy 
      Scale was used to measure subjective, perception-based health literacy. 
      Correlations, comparisons of means, linear and binary logistic regression, and 
      mediation models were used to determine the associations. RESULTS: Objective and 
      subjective health literacy were weakly associated with one another (r=0.06, P=.24). 
      High objective health literacy levels were associated with an inclination to behave 
      in ways that are beneficial to one's own or others' health (Exp[B]=2.068, P=.004) 
      and an ability to recognize low-quality online sources of health information 
      (β=-.4698, P=.005). The recognition also improved participants' choice of treatment 
      (β=-.3345, P<.001). Objective health literacy helped people to recognize 
      misinformation on health websites and improved their judgment on their treatment for 
      depression. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported, perception-based health literacy should be 
      treated as a separate concept from objective, performance-based health literacy. 
      Only objective health literacy appears to have the potential to prevent people from 
      becoming victims of health disinformation.

TI  - Rebranding School Health: The Power of Education for Health Literacy.
PG  - 670-676
LID - 10.1111/josh.13056 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between health and learning generally goes without 
      question in developed countries, and has a philosophic, economic, and statutory 
      basis. Historically, school health and school health education have evolved in 
      response to addressing the public health needs of the times. Health literacy skills 
      are more important now than ever. Living in an ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic 
      reminds us of the vital role of being in control of our health, wherein health 
      literacy plays a "life or death" role in our daily lives. METHODS: Considering the 
      evolution of school health education, we examine the significance of health literacy 
      in our society and schools in contemporary times. RESULTS: We must take a critical 
      look at a place for education for health literacy and why it should be an innovative 
      path in adaptive, reimagined, and revitalized schools. CONCLUSIONS: It is time to 
      rebrand school health in general, and school health education specifically. Improved 
      health literacy is an asset leading to greater opportunities for health and 
      life-long learning.

TI  - Do health literacy disparities explain racial disparities in family-centered care 
      for youths with special health care needs?

LID - S0738-3991(20)30521-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.pec.2020.09.023 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship among youth health literacy, parental health 
      literacy, and family-centered care (FCC) for youth with special health care needs 
      (YSHCN) and assess potential racial disparities. METHODS: HL and FCC were assessed 
      in 486 Medicaid-enrolled YSHCN (ages 12-18) and their healthcare-responsible 
      parent/caregiver. Analyses assessed racial differences in HL and FCC for parents and 
      youth using logistic regression. RESULTS: Half of youth and over 80 percent of 
      parents had adequate HL (REALM score ≥62). Adequate HL was significantly lower in 
      African Americans (AA) for both YSHCN and parents. Only 57 % of parents and 29 % of 
      YSHCN reported FCC. AA YSHCN reported significantly lower levels of FCC compared to 
      White YSHCN. AA parents trended lower for FCC compared to Whites, though the 
      disparity was not significant. AA youth and parents had significantly lower odds of 
      reporting that doctors spent enough time with them compared to Whites. CONCLUSION: 
      Results suggest that AA and those with less than adequate health literacy experience 
      lower FCC, however the relationship between race and health literacy does not 
      explain the racial disparity in FCC. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Provider time spent 
      focused on HL may not reduce the racial disparity in FCC, but opportunities for 
      improvement exist.

TI  - Leveraging Organizational Health Literacy to Enhance Health Promotion and Risk 
      Prevention: A Narrative and Interpretive Literature Review.
PG  - 115-128
AB  - Organizational health literacy involves the health care organizations' ability to 
      establish an empowering and co-creating relationship with patients, engaging them in 
      the design and delivery of health services in collaboration with health 
      professionals. Although scholars agree that organizational health literacy 
      contributes to health promotion and risk prevention via patient empowerment, 
      literature is not consistent in depicting the interplay between organizational 
      health literacy and preventive medicine. The article intends to shed light into this 
      issue, summarizing current knowledge about this topic and advancing avenues for 
      further development. A narrative literature review was performed through a 
      systematic search on PubMed(®), Scopus(®), and Web of Science(™). The review focused 
      on 50 relevant contributions. Organizational health literacy triggers the transition 
      towards a patient-centered approach to care. It complements individual health 
      literacy, enabling patients to actively participate in health promotion and risk 
      prevention as co-producers of health services and co-creators of value. However, 
      many obstacles - including lack of time and limited resources available - prevent 
      the transition towards health literate health care organizations. Two initiatives 
      are required to overcome extant barriers. On the one hand, a health literate 
      workforce should be prepared to increase the institutional ability of health care 
      organizations to empower and engage patients in health co-creation. On the other 
      hand, increased efforts should be made to assess organizational health literacy and 
      to make its contribution to preventive medicine explicit.

TI  - [Health Literacy Among German Health Professionals-To-Be - Exploratory Pilot Study].
LID - 10.1055/a-1657-9627 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Health literacy is defined as the ability to collect, understand, 
      evaluate and use health information. Previous studies have shown that the German 
      population has only an average level of health literacy. Health professionals such 
      as nurses, doctors or midwives need to be health literate themselves to promote 
      patients' health literacy, as well as to protect and promote their own health. So 
      far, there is a lack of research about health literacy among health professionals in 
      Germany. The objective of this study was to assess the health literacy of health 
      professionals. METHOD: The study involved 583 participants from the final year 
      classes of the DHBW Stuttgart and dual cooperation partners (vocational schools and 
      academic teaching hospitals). These included graduates of nursing, midwifery and 
      therapy (physiotherapy/logo-/occupational therapy), as well as management in health 
      care and medical students in their practical year. The questionnaire HLS-EU-Q16 was 
      used to record health literacy. By means of 16 questions, the participants rated on 
      a 4-point scale how easy or difficult it was for them to find, understand, assess 
      and implement health-related information. RESULTS: The study showed that only 30.1% 
      of the participants had sufficient health literacy; 48.9% of the participants showed 
      problematic health literacy, 21.0% inadequate health literacy. The analysis of the 
      individual questions showed that, in almost all areas, paticipants reported more 
      problems in finding, understanding, assessing and implementing health-related 
      information than respondents in other European countries. CONCLUSIONS: The present 
      study shows that young health professionals have limited health literacy. Further 
      research is needed to obtain a more comprehensive and differentiated picture of 
      health literacy among health professionals. Health literacy skills and competencies 
      should be systematically introduced in health professions-related study curricula, 
      as well as in bedside training.

TI  - Health Literacy in Hospital Outpatient Waiting Areas: An Observational Study of What 
      Is Available to and Accessed by Consumers.
PG  - 124-139
LID - 10.1177/1937586720954541 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate: (1) the types of health information, resources, and supports 
      available to consumers in hospital outpatient waiting areas and (2) whether these 
      are accessed by consumers. BACKGROUND: Outpatient waiting areas commonly offer 
      health information, resources, and supports to improve the health literacy of 
      waiting consumers. It is not known what is available to or accessed by consumers in 
      hospital outpatient rehabilitation waiting areas. METHODS: A multicenter, 
      prospective, observational, cross-sectional study was conducted in the waiting areas 
      of two hospital outpatient rehabilitation services. Direct observations (in person 
      and video recordings) of the waiting areas were used to describe what health 
      information, resources, and supports were available and, if present, what was being 
      accessed and for how long by consumers. RESULTS: Fifteen hours of in-person and 
      video-recorded observations were documented on purpose-designed instruments across 
      the two sites during 18 observation sessions over 8 days. A total of 68 different 
      health information and resources were identified. Approximately half were 
      specifically for consumers (Site 1: 57%; Site 2: 53%). Only seven (10%) were 
      accessed by consumers across both sites. Each resource (n = 7) was only accessed 
      once. Health resources were used by consumers for 0.8% (3/360 min) of the 
      observation time at each site. Health and social supports and use of other non 
      health resources were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: Available health information, 
      resources, and supports were infrequently and briefly accessed by consumers. Further 
      research is required to explore what consumers want and need to improve the health 
      literacy responsiveness of hospital outpatient waiting areas.

TI  - Literacy critical to heart failure management: a scoping review.
PG  - 1413-1419
LID - 10.1007/s10741-020-09964-6 [doi]
AB  - Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome most commonly encountered among older 
      adults. This complex clinical syndrome is associated with poor health outcomes such 
      as frequent admissions and mortality. These adverse outcomes are commonly associated 
      with poor self-care and lower health literacy. Literacy is a combination of 
      knowledge and skills and often reflected by appropriate interaction with the 
      community, while health literacy is the cognitive and social skills reflected by 
      accessing and comprehending health information and making appropriate health 
      decisions. These decisions are common and challenging to patients with heart 
      failure. Poor outcomes are said to be reduced by adequate self-care, which is 
      associated with health literacy among heart failure patients. Better self-care was 
      also shown to be associated with self-efficacy and self-confidence that were in turn 
      associated with health literacy. Hence, enhancing health literacy among patient with 
      heart failure is critical to enable them to increase control over their disease by 
      better understanding and participating in health care, while being empowered to take 
      part in designing health care services and even tailoring research to serve their 
      needs and consequently improve outcome at the individual and community level. In 
      clinical practice, assessing health literacy, measuring health literacy, and 
      identifying patients at risk of low nutrition literacy is important to enhance 
      health literacy and health outcomes. Hence, developing reliable and valid methods 
      and tools for assessment and developing tailored and targeted interventions is of 
      critical importance.

TI  - The Relationship Between Health Literacy Level and Media Used as a Source of 
      Health-Related Information.
PG  - e109-e117
LID - 10.3928/24748307-20210330-01 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have not shown the level of health literacy or 
      associated factors on a national level in Turkey using a scale that has been adapted 
      to the country and its culture. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine health 
      literacy levels in Turkey and to investigate the association of health literacy with 
      socioeconomic factors as well as with the instruments used as sources of 
      health-related information. METHODS: This cross-sectional, nationally representative 
      study was conducted using a computer-assisted personal interview approach and 
      included 6,228 households (response rate, 70.9%). The Turkey Health Literacy Scale 
      was used to measure health literacy. Sources of health-related information, such as 
      newspapers, television, internet, and smartphones, were included in the regression 
      model for health literacy. KEY RESULTS: The proportion of participants with 
      inadequate and problematic health literacy was 30.9% and 38%, respectively, showing 
      that approximately 7 of 10 participants had limited health literacy. The frequencies 
      of inadequate and problematic health literacy were higher in the disease prevention 
      and promotion domains (37.4% and 34.2%, respectively) compared with those in the 
      health care domain (27.1% and 31.3%, respectively). The most frequently used medium 
      as a source of health-related information was the internet (48.6%), followed by 
      television (33%). In controlled models, higher health literacy scores were 
      associated with higher education and income levels. The effects of television (β = 
      1,917), internet (β = 2,803), newspapers (β = 1,489), and smartphones (β = 1,974) as 
      sources of health-related information were statistically significant in the general 
      health literacy index model. CONCLUSIONS: Health literacy in Turkey reflects social 
      inequalities. The model accounting for socioeconomic variables demonstrated the 
      relevance of sources of health information to level of health literacy. These 
      findings emphasize the importance of improving sources of health information to 
      improve health literacy. [HLRP: Health Literacy Research and Practice. 
      2021;5(2):e109-e117.] Plain Language Summary: This is a cross-sectional study that 
      is representative of the population of Turkey. We reported that health literacy 
      scores were higher for people in higher levels of socioeconomic status. We showed 
      that using the television, internet, newspapers, and smartphones as a source of 
      health-related information is associated with health literacy even when accounting 
      for socioeconomic variables.

TI  - The relationship of health literacy, wellbeing and religious beliefs in neglected 
      and unequal contexts-Results of a survey study in central Afghanistan.
PG  - 80-87
LID - 10.1002/hpja.419 [doi]
AB  - ISSUE ADDRESSED: While multiple studies worldwide reveal the strong impact of 
      various determinants on health literacy, empirical data on the link between health 
      literacy and other important dimensions of health equity (such as quality of life, 
      beliefs and health literacy in crisis-affected religious countries such as 
      Afghanistan) is scarce. To inform and develop promising health promotion for people 
      in need, we analysed the relationship between health literacy, quality of life and 
      spiritual and religious beliefs. METHODS: In this first study on health literacy in 
      Afghanistan, we interviewed 522 men and 324 women in the Ghazni province. Besides 
      the HLS-EU-16, we used Quality of Life (WHO-QoL-BREF) and the WHO-SRPB-BREF 
      questionnaires in Dari and Pashto. We performed descriptive, uni- and multivariate 
      analyses. RESULTS: The levels of HL, QoL and SRPB_coping are comparatively low among 
      Afghan men from the Ghazni province, but higher among women on all scales. HL and 
      QoL are positively associated with education and negatively with age (in the female 
      subsample). HL and QoL show a moderate correlation among women but not among men. We 
      found mixed results for the relationship between SRPB and HL or QoL. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The study highlights that health literacy is not a singular factor but related to 
      wellbeing. SO WHAT?: Health education might be promising while combining health 
      literacy to the idea of quality of life of everyone, even those living in poor and 
      illiterate environments.

AB  - Studies evaluating the influence of health literacy on patient behavior and outcomes 
      suggest a positive relationship between health literacy and health knowledge, health 
      behaviors, and health status. In Latin American countries, studies assessing health 
      literacy are few, regional, and demonstrate considerable variation, with reported 
      rates of adequate health literacy ranging from 5.0% to 73.3%. In this paper, we 
      examine and explore the state of health literacy and efforts to promote it in Latin 
      America. Key challenges to those efforts include socioeconomic inequality, 
      social/geographic isolation, and cultural-, language-, and policy-related barriers, 
      many of which disproportionately affect indigenous populations and others living in 
      rural areas. Greater use of infographics, videos, and mobile apps may enhance health 
      literacy and patient empowerment, especially when language barriers exist. This 
      paper provides strategies and tools for tailored programming, examples of successful 
      health literacy interventions, and policy recommendations to improve health literacy 
      in Latin America, intending to spur additional discussion and action. Centrally 
      organized collaboration across multiple sectors of society, with community 
      involvement, will enhance health literacy and improve health and well-being across 
      Latin America.

TI  - Addressing Health Literacy in Schools in Germany: Concept Analysis of the Mandatory 
      Digital and Media Literacy School Curriculum.
PG  - 687389

AB  - It is generally agreed upon that the development of health literacy should be 
      addressed from an early age onwards in order to empower children to develop their 
      full health potential. Schools can be seen as an ideal venue for strengthening 
      health literacy because they reach almost all school-aged children throughout their 
      school years. The development of health literacy at a young age is a catalyst for 
      healthy development throughout across the life span. Evidence shows that health and 
      education are intertwined with favorable effects for health (e.g., health behavior, 
      knowledge) and education outcomes (e.g., academic achievement). However, health 
      literacy is often not sufficiently integrated into the school curriculum despite its 
      importance to health and education. Integrating health literacy into schools is 
      challenging, as both schools and teachers already face numerous educational 
      requirements that may prevent them from addressing health in the classroom because 
      they perceive it as an additional task. This is why taking a sensitive approach is 
      important, adapted to the needs of schools and highlighting the benefits of health 
      literacy. Installing health literacy in schools succeeds more easily if it can be 
      linked to existing curricular requirements. In this context, curriculum and 
      instruction on media literacy, information literacy, and digital literacy are most 
      promising subjects to include health literacy because these concepts share many 
      commonalities with health literacy and often are already part of the school 
      curriculum. The aim of this article is to (1) analyze a mandatory curriculum on 
      media literacy in the state of North-Rhine-Westphalia in Germany, (2) highlight its 
      intersections with health literacy, and (3) show how it can be used to address 
      health literacy. The state media literacy framework is based on the federal 
      standards for "digital education" developed by the German Conference on Education 
      Ministries und Cultural Affairs (KMK). As education policy and practice is 
      decentralized with sixteen federal states in Germany, each of them has got their own 
      media literacy framework, or they are currently developing it. This curriculum 
      analysis may serve as a methodological blueprint for educationalists, teachers, and 
      policy-maker elsewhere in order to include health literacy into existing curricula 
      both health and non-health. It may help to integrate health literacy into schools 
      when combined with existing curricula.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Health literacy is a critical determinant of health. However, the 
      association between health literacy and outcomes among Chinese residents has not 
      been studied using nationally representative data. This study examines the 
      association between health literacy and self-rated health among Chinese residents 
      based on the 2017 China Health Literacy Survey. METHODS: The 2017 China Health 
      Literacy Survey was conducted among non-institutionalized residents aged 15-69 years 
      from 31 provinces in China. Self-rated health was measured using a single question 
      with a 1-5 scale. Health literacy was assessed using the Chinese Health Literacy 
      Scale. Multilevel linear regression models examined the association between health 
      literacy and self-rated health. Data were collected in 2017 and analyzed between 
      2018 and 2019. RESULTS: The final sample size was 85,384. The overall weighted mean 
      of the self-rated health score was 4.02 (95% CI=4.00, 4.03). After adjusting for 
      individual-, county-, and province-level covariates, Chinese residents with higher 
      levels of health literacy were more likely to have better self-rated health 
      (β=0.0007, SE=0.0002, p<0.001). Of 6 dimensions of health literacy, 4 (i.e., 
      infectious diseases literacy, chronic diseases literacy, medical care literacy, and 
      health information literacy) were associated with self-rated health. Additionally, 
      self-rated health was associated with gender, age, education, occupation, annual 
      household income, and chronic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Using nationally 
      representative data collected in 2017, this study found that self-rated health is 
      associated with health literacy among Chinese residents aged 15-69 years. The 
      promotion of health literacy should be an important component of health education, 
      patient management, and health promotion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Organizational health literacy (OHL) within the public health setting is 
      lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to form a health literacy (HL) 
      improvement team consisting of university researchers and Virginia Department of 
      Health (VDH) district directors and staff to assess and improve OHL practices of VDH 
      staff in four medically underserved health districts in southwest Virginia. METHODS: 
      The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Health Literacy Universal Precautions 
      Toolkit guided this mixed-methods needs assessment and improvement plan. VDH staff 
      completed a 44-item survey adapted from this Toolkit and a roundtable discussion to 
      indicate their perceptions of current OHL practices. VDH clients completed a survey 
      including seven items measuring perceptions of staff OHL practices and three items 
      measuring subjective HL. KEY RESULTS: About one-half of VDH staff (n = 252, 88% 
      female, average age 49 ± 12 years, 23% ≤ high school education [HS]) reported "doing 
      well" across all OHL domains. Staff survey and roundtable discussion revealed the 
      need to strengthen the written communication domain. Among 185 VDH clients (82% 
      female, average age 33 ± 14 years, 40% ≤ HS), perceptions of staff OHL practices 
      were high, ranging from 3.07 to 3.64 (scale of 1-4). Client HL status was 
      significantly positively correlated (p < .01-.05) with 5 of 7 OHL practices. 
      Findings aided development and initial implementation of an OHL improvement plan, 
      including e-newsletters and in-person workshops. On average, 60% of staff opened 
      quarterly e-newsletters. Staff ratings of the Clear Communication Index workshop 
      were high in terms of utility and applicability of content. CONCLUSIONS: Results 
      reflected notable strengths and weaknesses in current OHL practices from staff and 
      client perspectives, with the greatest need identified in written communication. 
      E-newsletter series and in-person workshops on the Clear Communication Index helped 
      lay groundwork for additional HL improvement activities for VDH staff. Limitations 
      and future recommendations for public health settings are discussed. [HLRP: Health 
      Literacy Research and Practice. 2021;5(1):e35-e48.] PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: This 
      study describes use of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Health 
      Literacy Universal Precautions Toolkit to conduct an organizational health literacy 
      needs assessment and improvement plan in a public health setting, the Virginia 
      Department of Health. Assessment of staff and clients revealed strengths and 
      weaknesses in organizational health literacy practices. Feedback guided efforts to 
      improve organizational health literacy capacity.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the importance of 
      health literacy. This commentary discusses the consequences of poor health literacy 
      and argues that we need to improve health literacy. Better health literacy has the 
      potential to improve community trust, alleviate health disparities, and improve the 
      results of the immediate response required in the early stages of a pandemic. The 
      commentary argues that health literacy has to be addressed as part of mandatory 
      school curriculum. Methods on how to improve and provide equitable access to 
      education are also discussed.

      Sickle Cell Disease.
PG  - 307-312
LID - 10.1177/10434542211011045 [doi]
AB  - Background: Health literacy may influence the transition from pediatric care to 
      adult care in adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD). It is postulated that one 
      influencing factor of health literacy in adolescents with SCD is health-seeking 
      behavior. The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to explore health-seeking 
      behaviors of adolescents with SCD and (2) to determine if there are significant 
      differences in health literacy levels of adolescents with SCD based upon 
      health-seeking behaviors. Methods: This was a cross-sectional, descriptive study 
      evaluating health-seeking behaviors and health literacy in 110 Black and 
      non-Hispanic adolescents with SCD. Convenience sampling was utilized for 
      recruitment. The inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of one of the four primary 
      genotypes of SCD and age of 10-19 years. Health literacy was evaluated using the 
      Newest Vital Sign (NVS). Frequencies and percentages were calculated for all 
      variables. Independent Samples t-tests were conducted to evaluate differences in 
      health literacy scores based upon differing health-seeking behaviors. Results: The 
      mean age of participants was 14.8 years (SD = 2.2). The mean NVS score was 2.7 
      (SD = 1.6). The two most common responses to "where do you go FIRST for health 
      information?" were the Internet (29.6%; n = 40) and health care providers (27.4%; 
      n = 37). There was no statistical difference in NVS scores between adolescents using 
      the Internet versus health care providers as their first source of health 
      information (t[75] = - .12; p = .22). Discussion: Knowledge of health-seeking 
      behaviors and health literacy in adolescents with SCD gives insight into the design 
      and evaluation of future interventions to improve health and health literacy in this 
      population.

TI  - Are Health Literacy and Patient Activation Related to Health Outcomes in Breast 
      Cancer Patients?
PG  - e171-e178
LID - 10.3928/24748307-20210524-02 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessing health literacy and patient activation at the beginning of 
      care could facilitate the provision of appropriate information to patients with 
      breast cancer and increase the effectiveness of interventions geared toward 
      improving patient involvement in self-managing their health and, consequently, their 
      quality of life. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate cancer health 
      literacy and patient activation in patients with breast cancer as well as examine 
      their relationships to health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and resource use. 
      METHODS: Patients with breast cancer positive for human epidermal growth factor 
      receptor 2 (HER2+) receiving care at 12 oncology clinics in Texas were offered 
      participation in the study via convenience sampling. The survey consisted of the 
      6-item Cancer Health Literacy Tool, the 13-item Patient Activation Measure, the 
      27-item Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (version 4), and 
      single-item measures for number of emergency department visits and hospitalizations 
      as well as clinical and demographic characteristics. KEY RESULTS: The mean age of 
      the 146 study participants was 57.1 ± 10.8 years; 92% (n = 134) had a high 
      probability (≥0.7) of adequate cancer health literacy whereas 68% percent (n = 99) 
      had high patient activation (level 3 or 4). Cancer health literacy had significant 
      positive relationships with education and household income. Patient activation, 
      education, and number of treatment types received explained 23% of the variation in 
      HRQoL, and all except cancer health literacy were positive and significant 
      predictors. No bivariate/multivariate analysis was conducted for emergency 
      department visits and hospitalizations because there were few reported incidents. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that aim to improve HRQoL in patients with breast cancer 
      could target modifiable factors like patient activation. The homogeneity of cancer 
      health literacy among study participants might have influenced its nonsignificant 
      relationship with HRQoL and patient activation. Further assessments of health 
      literacy and patient activation in larger and more diverse populations of patients 
      with breast cancer are warranted. [HLRP: Health Literacy Research and Practice. 
      2021;5(3):e171-e178.] Plain Language Summary: In this study, the majority of 
      patients with breast cancer were found to have high levels of cancer health 
      literacy, patient activation, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The 
      significant relationship between patient activation and HRQoL implies that patients 
      with breast cancer who are able to actively participate in managing their health and 
      health care are more likely to have higher HRQoL. Interventions that aim to improve 
      HRQoL in patients with breast cancer could target modifiable factors like patient 
      activation.

TI  - The Impact of Mental Health Literacy Training Programs on the Mental Health Literacy 
      of University Students: a Systematic Review.
LID - 10.1007/s11121-021-01283-y [doi]
AB  - Student mental health is of growing concern for the university education sector. 
      Supporting opportunities to increase mental health literacy of students is one 
      strategy in which universities and colleges are actively investing to support 
      students build their capacity to be well. This study is a systematic review of 
      mental health literacy training (MHLT) programs, other than Mental Health First Aid 
      training, to examine their impact on the mental health literacy of university 
      students. The review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for 
      Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) (Online Resource 1) and A Measurement 
      Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR2) guidelines. Search terms related to 
      mental health literacy concepts, mental health literacy training and university 
      students were used in four major databases (i.e. EBSCOhost, Ovid, ProQuest and Web 
      of Science), retrieving a total of 1219 articles, with 44 studies selected for 
      full-text review, and a final number of 24 studies included for review based on 
      pre-determined eligibility criteria. Results were reported against three main 
      themes: types of MHLT offered; common practices, processes and implementation 
      elements; and effectiveness of intervention. Results indicate a high level of 
      variability in approaches to mental health literacy interventions and measures of 
      assessment and reporting. Additionally, reported benefits to mental health literacy 
      failed to report on comparable units of improvement or the sustainability of 
      benefits. Although it is in the best interest of universities to prioritise early 
      intervention programs to address mental health and improve wellbeing, more robust 
      data is required to establish the effectiveness of MHLT programs in achieving this 
      aim.

TI  - Supporting patients to be involved in decisions about their health and care: 
      Development of a best practice health literacy App for Australian adults living with 
      Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 115-127
LID - 10.1002/hpja.416 [doi]
AB  - ISSUE ADDRESSED: Inadequate health literacy is common in those with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD), especially among culturally and linguistically diverse groups. 
      Patient information for people with CKD, including those with kidney failure 
      requiring dialysis, is often written beyond their literacy level, and many 
      CKD-related apps are not accurate or evidence based. These represent important 
      barriers to health care decision-making and equity in access to health care. 
      METHODS: We developed a cross-platform application (the "SUCCESS app") to support 
      Australian adults with kidney failure requiring dialysis to actively participate in 
      self-management and decision-making. App content was informed by health literacy 
      theory which recognises the importance of reducing the complexity of health 
      information as well as equipping consumers with the skills necessary to access, 
      understand and act on this information. The development team comprised members of 
      diverse backgrounds and expertise, including nursing, allied health, psychology, 
      epidemiology, nephrology and IT, as well as consumer representatives. RESULTS: 
      Content areas included diet, fluids, medicine, physical activity, emotional 
      well-being and supportive care, chosen as they represent important decision points 
      in the CKD trajectory. To support functional health literacy, a four-step process to 
      simplify written content was used including calculating readability statistics, 
      applying the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool, supplementing written 
      information with video and audio content, and incorporating micro-learning and 
      interactive quizzes. To develop communicative and critical health literacy skills, 
      question prompt lists and evidence-based volitional help sheets were included in 
      each module to support question-asking and behaviour change. We also developed 
      animated skills training related to communication, shared decision-making and 
      critical appraisal of health information. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first health 
      literacy informed app developed to promote active patient participation in CKD 
      management and decision-making. Ongoing evaluation of the SUCCESS app through 
      analysis of quantitative and qualitative data will provide valuable insights into 
      the feasibility of implementing the app with dialysis patients, and the impact of 
      the intervention of psychosocial and clinical outcomes. SO WHAT?: Digital health 
      solutions have been found to improve self-management for chronic conditions, and 
      could optimise the use of health care services and patient outcomes.

LID - e2122576
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Health literacy is considered an important social determinant of health 
      that may underlie many health disparities, but it is unclear whether inadequate 
      health literacy among pregnant individuals is associated with adverse maternal and 
      neonatal outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between maternal health 
      literacy and maternal and neonatal outcomes among nulliparous individuals. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a secondary analysis of a large, multicenter 
      cohort study of 10 038 nulliparous individuals in the US (2010-2013). Participants 
      underwent 3 antenatal study visits and had detailed maternal and neonatal data 
      abstracted. Data analysis was performed from July to December 2019. EXPOSURES: 
      Between 16 and 21 weeks of gestation, health literacy was assessed using the Rapid 
      Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine-Short Form, a validated 7-item word 
      recognition test. In accordance with standard scoring, results were dichotomized as 
      inadequate vs adequate health literacy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: On the basis of 
      theoretical causal pathways between health literacy and health outcomes, a priori 
      maternal and neonatal outcomes (determined via medical records) were selected for 
      this analysis. Multivariable Poisson regression models were constructed to estimate 
      the associations between health literacy and outcomes. Sensitivity analyses in which 
      education was removed from models and that excluded individuals who spoke English as 
      a second language were performed. RESULTS: Of 9341 participants who completed the 
      Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine-Short Form, the mean (SD) age was 27.0 
      (5.6) years, and 2540 (27.4%) had publicly funded prenatal care. Overall, 1638 
      participants (17.5%) had scores indicative of inadequate health literacy. 
      Participants with inadequate health literacy were more likely to be younger (mean 
      [SD] age, 22.9 [5.0] vs 27.9 [5.3] years), have less educational attainment (some 
      college education or greater, 1149 participants [73.9%] vs 5279 participants 
      [94.5%]), have publicly funded insurance (1008 participants [62.2%] vs 1532 
      participants [20.0%]), and report they were a member of an underrepresented racial 
      or ethnic group (non-Hispanic Black, 506 participants [30.9%] vs 780 participants 
      [10.1%]; Hispanic, 516 participants [31.5%] vs 948 participants [12.3%]) compared 
      with those with adequate health literacy. Participants who had inadequate health 
      literacy had greater risk of cesarean delivery (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.11; 95% 
      CI, 1.01-1.23) and major perineal laceration (aRR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.03-2.01). The 
      adjusted risks of small-for-gestational-age status (aRR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.14-1.58), 
      low birth weight (aRR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.07-1.65), and 5-minute Apgar score less than 
      4 (aRR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.16-6.65) were greater for neonates born to participants with 
      inadequate health literacy. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that inadequate maternal health 
      literacy is associated with a variety of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.

AB  - One of the most persistent and troubling health disparities is the underutilization 
      of mental health services, particularly for depression and anxiety, commonly 
      occurring behavioral health concerns. The gap between individuals who need mental 
      health care and those who receive care is large, and identified barriers to 
      treatment include poor mental health and insurance literacy, as well as stigmatizing 
      attitudes toward mental health disorders. The present study presents the results of 
      an inquiry into the mental health literacy, insurance literacy, internalized stigma, 
      and mental health symptoms. Results suggest that mental health literacy is poor and 
      associated with higher rates of depression, anxiety, stress, internalized stigma, 
      and caregiver burden. Implications of poor mental health literacy, as well as 
      demographic disparities in literacy, are discussed.

TI  - Assessing mental health literacy of primary health care workers in Kenya: a 
      cross-sectional survey.

AB  - AIM: To assess mental health literacy of health workers in primary health care 
      services in Kenya. BACKGROUND: Mental illness is common in Kenya, yet there are 
      fewer than 500 specialist mental health workers to serve Kenya's population of over 
      50 million. The World Health Organization recommends the integration of mental 
      health care into primary health care services to improve access to and equity of 
      this care, especially in low and middle-income countries. An important step to 
      integrating mental health care into primary health care services is to determine 
      mental health literacy levels of the primary health care workforce. METHOD: A 
      cross-sectional survey using Jorm's Mental Health Literacy Instrument (adapted for 
      the Kenyan context) was administered to 310 primary health care workers in four 
      counties of Kenya. RESULTS: Of the 310 questionnaires distributed, 212 (68.3%) were 
      returned. Of the respondents, 13% had a formal mental health qualification, while 
      only 8.7% had received relevant continuing professional development in the five 
      years preceding the survey. Just over one third (35.6%) of primary health care 
      workers could correctly identify depression, with even fewer recognising 
      schizophrenia (15.7%). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary information 
      about mental health literacy among primary health care workers in Kenya. The 
      majority of respondents had low mental health literacy as indicated by their 
      inability to identify common mental disorders. While identifying gaps in primary 
      health care workers' mental health knowledge, these data highlight opportunities for 
      capacity building that can enhance mental health care in Kenya and similar low and 
      middle-income countries.

LID - 603325
AB  - Background: Health literacy is essential to population health, yet few studies have 
      described the geographic variation in health literacy in China. This study aimed to 
      investigate the level of health literacy, its regional heterogeneities, as well as 
      influencing factors of health literacy in 25 provinces or municipalities in China. 
      Methods: The study was conducted among residents aged 15-69 years from 25 provinces 
      or municipalities in China in 2017. Health literacy was measured using the Chinese 
      Health Literacy Scale. MapInfo software was used to map the geographic distribution. 
      Multiple logistic regression was used to adjust for the factors associated with the 
      health literacy level in the overall and regional samples. Results: A total of 3,482 
      participants were included in the study, comprising 1,792 (51.5%) males and 1,690 
      (48.5%) females. Notable geographic variation was observed in health literacy 
      levels. The proportion of respondents with adequate health literacy was 22.3% 
      overall, 33.0% in the eastern region, 23.1% in the central region, and 17.6% in the 
      western region. The proportion of adequate health literacy in the different 
      provinces and municipalities ranged from 10.5% (Xinjiang) to 47.0% (Beijing). Being 
      a female [odds ratio (OR) = 1.353; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.146-1.597], 
      having a high education level [OR ranging from 2.794 (CI: 1.469-5.314) to 9.458 (CI: 
      5.251-17.036)], having a high economic status [OR ranging from 1.537 (CI: 
      1.248-1.891) to 1.850 (CI: 1.498-2.284)], having a good self-rated health status [OR 
      ranging from 2.793 (CI: 1.534-5.083) to 3.003 (CI: 1.672-5.395)], and having 
      frequent community health education (OR = 1.588; 95% CI: 1.066-2.365) were 
      independently associated with adequate health literacy. Conclusions: The health 
      literacy level in the 25 provinces or municipalities of China is relatively low 
      compared to the developed countries, and there are heterogeneities among different 
      regions, between urban and rural areas, and among different social groups. Tailored 
      health education and promotion strategies are needed for different subgroups of 
      residents.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Potential role of health literacy in determining adherence to 
      COVID-19 preventive behavior, pharmacological, and lifestyle management among 
      diagnosed patients of chronic diseases during nationwide lockdown is inadequately 
      investigated. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May-August 2020 
      among diagnosed patients of chronic diseases residing in a COVID-19 hotspot of urban 
      Jodhpur, Rajasthan, and availing health services from primary care facility. 
      Telephonic interviews of participants were conducted to determine their health 
      literacy using HLS-EU-Q47 questionnaire, adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviour 
      as per World Health Organization recommendations, and compliance to prescribed 
      pharmacological and physical activity recommendations for chronic disease. RESULTS: 
      All the 605 diagnosed patients of chronic diseases availing services from primary 
      care facility were contacted for the study, yielding response rate of 68% with 412 
      agreeing to participate. Insufficient health literacy was observed for 65.8% 
      participants. Only about half of participants had scored above median for COVID-19 
      awareness (55.1%) and preventive behavior (45.1%). Health literacy was observed to 
      be significant predictor of COVID-19 awareness [aOR: 3.53 (95% CI: 1.81-6.88)]; 
      COVID-19 preventive behavior [aOR: 2.06, 95%CI; 1.14-3.69] and compliance to 
      pharmacological management [aOR: 3.05; 95% CI: 1.47-6.35] but not for physical 
      activity. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 awareness, preventive behavior, and compliance to 
      pharmacological management is associated with health literacy among patients of 
      chronic disease availing services from primary health facility. Focusing on health 
      literacy could thus be an essential strategic intervention yielding long term 
      benefits.

AB  - e-Health literacy has become more important in promoting healthy lifestyles in 
      recent years. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of undergraduate 
      nursing students' e-Health literacy on healthy lifestyle behaviours. This 
      cross-sectional study was conducted during the 2016-2017 academic year at a Nursing 
      Department in the Faculty of Health Sciences in Istanbul. The study population 
      consisted of 232 undergraduate nursing students. The study sample was 205 students 
      who volunteered to participate in the research. The data were collected using the 
      Structured Questionnaire Form, the e-Health Literacy Scale in Adolescent and the 
      Adolescent Lifestyle Profile Scale. The mean score of the e-Health Literacy Scale in 
      Adolescent was 29.50 ± 5.02. The mean total score of the Adolescent Lifestyle 
      Profile was 112.11 ± 14.66. There was a positive correlation between students' 
      Internet attitudes and general health-promoting lifestyle (r = 0.273; p < 0.01), 
      indicating the higher the students' e-Health literacy, the higher their levels of 
      healthy lifestyle behaviours. The result showed that e-Health literacy is an 
      important parameter in promoting healthy lifestyle behaviours of nursing students.

TI  - Work-Related Health Literacy: A Scoping Review to Clarify the Concept.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18199945 [doi]
LID - 9945
AB  - The overall aim of this scoping review is to outline the current state of research 
      on health literacy (HL) in the workplace: the primary objective is to clarify the 
      concept of individual work-related HL; the secondary aims are to report on 
      interventions that promote individual work-related HL and to present respective 
      measurement instruments validated to date. A high level of work-related HL could 
      support work ability and in the longer run employability. These topics are becoming 
      increasingly important in current circumstances and in view of ongoing developments 
      (e.g., digitalization and "new" work). A basic understanding and measurement of HL 
      as an individual competence in the context of working life is necessary to develop 
      future interventions to promote HL among people of working age. According to the 
      participants, concept, and context (PCC) framework, we included articles on health 
      literacy (concept) in the target group of people of working age in the workplace 
      (population and context). Key information sources were the databases PubMed, CINAHL, 
      PsycInfo, and PSYNDEX. A total of 30 articles were included. There are several terms 
      for "health literacy in the workplace" (including individual work-related or 
      occupational HL). The conceptualizations of the individual employee's competence 
      covered all aspects of HL ("access", "understand", "appraise", and "apply" health 
      information). The conceptualizations differed, among others, in the covered time 
      horizon (referring either only to employees' current work situation or additionally 
      to their employability in the lifespan) or whether they referred also to the 
      viability of the respective company. Published interventions attempting to promote 
      individual work-related HL seem mostly to be targeted at the promotion of mental HL. 
      A variety of outcomes have been measured in intervention studies, while specific 
      measurement instruments for individual work-related HL seem to be scarce. We 
      recommend the development of country-specific instruments for the assessment of 
      individual work-related health literacy and to measure mental and physical 
      work-related health literacy.

TI  - The Community Health Supporting Environments and Residents' Health and Well-Being: 
      The Role of Health Literacy.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18157769 [doi]
LID - 7769
AB  - We evaluate the impacts that health supporting environments have on residents' 
      health and well-being. Using a stratified multi-stage sampling method, we select a 
      sample of 12,360 permanent adult residents aged 15-69, and collect information on 
      their health literacy level, as well as their demographic background and health. 
      This individual level data is then merged with the administrative health supporting 
      environment data. More than two thirds of residents self-reported having 
      good/excellent health, and the percent of adults living in communities with healthy 
      parks, healthy trails, and healthy huts in their community is 23 percent, 43 
      percent, and 25 percent, respectively. Controlling for a series of confounding 
      factors at the community and individual levels, we find that healthy parks and 
      healthy trails are positively correlated with self-reported health, which increases 
      the probability of self-reporting good health by 2.0 percentage points (p < 0.10) 
      and 6.0 percentage points (p < 0.01), respectively. Access to healthy huts is 
      negatively associated with self-reported health, decreasing the probability of 
      self-reporting good health by 5.0 percentage points (p < 0.01). Health literacy 
      plays a role in moderating the effect of health parks, and a positive effect is more 
      likely to be observed among adults with lower health literacy. Health supporting 
      environments may play a role in reducing the likelihood of undiagnosed diseases and 
      changing residents' lifestyles, which promotes the health and well-being of 
      residents, especially among those with inadequate health literacy.

TI  - How different health literacy dimensions influences health and well-being among men 
      and women: The mediating role of health behaviours.
PG  - 617-627
LID - 10.1111/hex.13208 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health literacy, the ability to access, understand, evaluate and apply 
      health information, was found to contribute to positive health outcomes, possibly 
      via promoting healthy behaviours. However, the specific pathways linking different 
      health literacy skills to health and well-being have remained unclear. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional survey with structural questionnaires was administered among 2236 
      adults in Hong Kong (mean age = 46.10 ± 19.05). Health literacy was measured by 
      HLS-Asian-47. Participants' physical conditions and subjective well-being were 
      predicted by health literacy and health behaviours with structural modelling path 
      analysis. RESULTS: Health literacy in finding and understanding information showed a 
      direct effect on enhancing physical health, while applying information capacity had 
      an indirect positive effect via promoting health behaviours, which was moderated by 
      sex. Only among women, this indirect effect predicting fewer physical symptoms and 
      better well-being was significant. CONCLUSIONS: Different health literacy dimensions 
      showed distinct direct and indirect pathways in influencing health for men and 
      women. Based on the findings, skill trainings should be developed to enhance both 
      gender's abilities of finding and understanding health information, while the 
      ability of applying health information should also be improved for modifying 
      lifestyle and promoting health, particularly for women. PATIENT OR PUBLIC 
      CONTRIBUTION: Two thousand and two hundred thirty-six adults from different 
      districts of Hong Kong participated in the study, and responded to questions on 
      health literacy, behaviours and health status.

TI  - Community-based Skill Building Intervention to Enhance Health Literacy Among Older 
      Rural Adults.
PG  - 668-676
LID - 10.1177/0193945920958014 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this article is to report the outcomes of a skill building 
      intervention to improve general health literacy and health literacy about 
      complementary and alternative therapies (CAM) among older rural adults. The 
      intervention was implemented in eight rural communities. Descriptive statistics and 
      general linear modeling were used for analysis. A total of 127 older adults 
      completed the initial session and Time 1 questionnaire, 67 (51%) completed the 
      intervention sessions and Time 2 questionnaire, and 52 (40.9%) completed the Time 3 
      questionnaire five months later. CAM health literacy scores and scores on one 
      general health literacy measure were significantly higher at Time 2 compared to Time 
      1 and 3. The decline in scores over time suggests a need for continuing strategies 
      to support older adults' health literacy. Assisting older adults to make safe health 
      care choices is a critical role for investigators, nurses, and other health care 
      providers.

TI  - The effect of health literacy on health status among residents in Qingdao, China: a 
      path analysis.
PG  - 78
LID - 10.1186/s12199-021-01001-8 [doi]
LID - 78
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health literacy is a public health goal which can be used as an 
      independent factor of health outcomes. This study aimed to assess the association 
      between health literacy and health status, as well as the two mediating factors of 
      behavior and self-efficacy among residents aged 15-69 years in Qingdao. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional survey was implemented among residents aged 15-69 years (N = 3793) 
      in Qingdao, China. A combination of stratified cluster random and proportional 
      probability sampling methods was used to select subjects for this study. Data were 
      collected using "The Chinese Citizen Health Literacy Questionnaire (2019)". We 
      proposed a hypothetical model for the relationship between sociodemographic 
      characteristics, health literacy, self-efficacy, health behavior, and health status, 
      and used path analysis to validate the hypothesis. RESULTS: The path analysis showed 
      that higher education (β = 0.293) and income (β = 0.135) are positively and directly 
      associated with greater health literacy, which was positively associated with health 
      status (β = 0.057). Health literacy is a direct influencing factor of health 
      behavior (β = 0.070) and self-efficacy (β = 0.099). Health behavior (β = 0.041) and 
      self-efficacy (β = 0.173) exerted a positive direct effect on health status. The 
      model explained 14.1% of variance for health literacy, 3.8% for self-efficacy, 5.7% 
      for health behavior, and 15.0% for health status. CONCLUSIONS: Health literacy was 
      identified to be a critical factor in health status. The results emphasized that the 
      dissemination of health knowledge, development of healthy behavior, and cultivation 
      of self-efficacy should be jointly promoted to reinforce the level of health status 
      among residents in future work.

TI  - Health Literacy in the Canton of Zurich: First Results of a Representative Study.

AB  - Managing health information and services is difficult for nearly half of the 
      population in Switzerland. Low health literacy has been shown to result in poorer 
      health and health outcomes as well as a higher utilization of health services. To 
      date, studies on health literacy in Switzerland have focused on a national level. 
      However, Switzerland is a federal state with 26 cantons and a strongly decentralized 
      health system. Therefore, the aim of this study is to understand how health literacy 
      is distributed within the population of the canton of Zurich specifically, and to 
      develop methods to determine whether an individual has a higher or lower level of 
      health literacy. There were a total of 1000 participants in this representative 
      study. Data was collected by an adapted version of the HLS-EU-Q47 and additional 
      sociodemographic questions. The majority (56%) of the reported difficulties 
      concerned accessing, understanding, appraising, and applying health information. The 
      findings confirm that health literacy follows a social gradient, whereby financially 
      deprived individuals and those with a low educational level report lower health 
      literacy. The need for action to strengthen the health literacy of these population 
      groups is therefore urgent. Interventions should pay particular attention to these 
      vulnerable groups and tailor resolutions to their needs and preferences.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop novel, scalable, and valid literacy profiles for identifying 
      limited health literacy patients by harnessing natural language processing. DATA 
      SOURCE: With respect to the linguistic content, we analyzed 283 216 secure messages 
      sent by 6941 diabetes patients to physicians within an integrated system's 
      electronic portal. Sociodemographic, clinical, and utilization data were obtained 
      via questionnaire and electronic health records. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study 
      used natural language processing and machine learning to generate five unique 
      "Literacy Profiles" by employing various sets of linguistic indices: Flesch-Kincaid 
      (LP_FK); basic indices of writing complexity, including lexical diversity (LP_LD) 
      and writing quality (LP_WQ); and advanced indices related to syntactic complexity, 
      lexical sophistication, and diversity, modeled from self-reported (LP_SR), and 
      expert-rated (LP_Exp) health literacy. We first determined the performance of each 
      literacy profile relative to self-reported and expert-rated health literacy to 
      discriminate between high and low health literacy and then assessed Literacy 
      Profiles' relationships with known correlates of health literacy, such as patient 
      sociodemographics and a range of health-related outcomes, including ratings of 
      physician communication, medication adherence, diabetes control, comorbidities, and 
      utilization. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: LP_SR and LP_Exp performed best in discriminating 
      between high and low self-reported (C-statistics: 0.86 and 0.58, respectively) and 
      expert-rated health literacy (C-statistics: 0.71 and 0.87, respectively) and were 
      significantly associated with educational attainment, race/ethnicity, Consumer 
      Assessment of Provider and Systems (CAHPS) scores, adherence, glycemia, 
      comorbidities, and emergency department visits. CONCLUSIONS: Since health literacy 
      is a potentially remediable explanatory factor in health care disparities, the 
      development of automated health literacy indicators represents a significant 
      accomplishment with broad clinical and population health applications. Health 
      systems could apply literacy profiles to efficiently determine whether quality of 
      care and outcomes vary by patient health literacy; identify at-risk populations for 
      targeting tailored health communications and self-management support interventions; 
      and inform clinicians to promote improvements in individual-level care.

TI  - Health education interventions to promote health literacy in adults with selected 
      non-communicable diseases living in low-to-middle income countries: A systematic 
      review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1417-1428
LID - 10.1111/jep.13554 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Health illiteracy is an important contributor to the 
      burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs); in particular in settings where health 
      illiteracy is part of a perpetuating system of risk factors. Interventions that 
      promote health literacy may provide an important tool in the primary and secondary 
      prevention of NCDs. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the 
      effectiveness of health literacy interventions on health literacy in the management 
      of patients with selected NCDs living in low-to-middle income countries (LMIC). 
      METHODS: Seven electronic databases were searched (October 29, 2020) for RCTs aimed 
      at improving health literacy in adults with NCDs in LMICs. Eligible NCDs included 
      those pertaining to cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic respiratory 
      disease (CRD) or Diabetes. Studies were included that explicitly focussed on 
      improving health literacy, and reported comprehensive measures of health literacy, 
      or components thereof (ie, knowledge, attitude or behaviour). Random-effect 
      meta-analyses were conducted for continuous outcome measures (Hedges-g). RESULTS: 
      The completed search yielded 2573 unique results of which 53 unique studies met the 
      inclusion criteria. Studies included patients with cancer (n = 1, 2%), CRD (n = 8, 
      15%), CVD (n = 11, 21%) or Diabetes (n = 33, 62%). A significant (P < .01) summary 
      effect was found for disease knowledge (SES = 1.27 [n = 23, 95%CI = 1.05-1.49]), 
      attitude (SES = 1.17 [n = 20, 95%CI = 0.88-1.47]), and behaviour (SES = 1.20 
      [n = 31, 95%CI = 0.94-1.46]). CONCLUSIONS: These results support the conclusion that 
      there is compelling evidence, in particular, for patients with Diabetes, that 
      health-literacy interventions are effective in promoting disease knowledge, attitude 
      and behaviour across four chronic conditions that drive the burden of NCDs.

      conceptual framework for future research.
PG  - 207-223

AB  - Good sexual health requires navigating intimate relationships within diverse power 
      dynamics and sexual cultures, coupled with the complexities of increasing 
      biomedicalisation of sexual health. Understanding this is important for the 
      implementation of biomedical HIV prevention. We propose a socially nuanced 
      conceptual framework for sexual health literacy developed through a consensus 
      building workshop with experts in the field. We use rigorous qualitative data 
      analysis to illustrate the functionality of the framework by reference to two 
      complementary studies. The first collected data from five focus groups (FGs) in 2012 
      (n = 22), with gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men aged 18-75 years 
      and 20 in-depth interviews in 2013 with men aged 19-60 years. The second included 12 
      FGs in 2014/15 with 55 patients/service providers involved in the use/implementation 
      of HIV self-testing or HIV prevention/care. Sexual health literacy goes well beyond 
      individual health literacy and is enabled through complex community practices and 
      multi-sectoral services. It is affected by emerging (and older) technologies and 
      demands tailored approaches for specific groups and needs. The framework serves as a 
      starting point for how sexual health literacy should be understood in the evaluation 
      of sustainable and equitable implementation of biomedical sexual healthcare and 
      prevention internationally.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that the health literacy of the German population is 
      low. The aim of this article is to analyze current developments in health literacy 
      on the basis of recent data. METHODS: The Health Literacy Survey Germany 2 (HLS-GER 
      2) is a representative quantitative survey of the German-speaking resident 
      population of Germany aged 18 and above. It was carried out in December 2019 and 
      January 2020 by paper-assisted personal oral interview (PAPI). Data on health 
      literacy and sociodemographic characteristics were acquired with an internationally 
      coordinated questionnaire. The instrument for measuring general health literacy 
      consisted of 47 questions that reflect an individual's ability to access, 
      understand, appraise, and apply health-related information. The associations between 
      general health literacy and sociodemographic factors were analyzed using bivariate 
      and multivariate statistical tests. RESULTS: 58.8% of the participants had low 
      health literacy, characterized by rating at least onethird of the questions as 
      "difficult" or "very difficult." Many respondents stated that they had difficulties 
      accessing (48.3%), understanding (47.7%), and applying (53.5%) information, and even 
      more of them (74.7%) reported difficulties appraising information. The correlation 
      coefficients reveal that health literacy is weakly associated with the following 
      variables: age, sex, social status, literacy, level of education, financial 
      deprivation, migration background, and the presence of one or more chronic diseases. 
      CONCLUSION: The findings of the HLS-GER 2 highlight the need for action in promoting 
      health literacy in the healthcare system. As the explanation of variance is low, 
      there are presumably other important determinants of health literacy that were not 
      taken into account. Further studies should be performed to investigate societal 
      conditions of supplying health information, for example, or social and personal 
      characteristics.

TI  - Health Literacy as a Major Contributor to Health-Promoting Behaviors among Korean 
      Teachers.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18063304 [doi]
LID - 3304
AB  - Teachers are not only subjects of school health efforts but also role models for 
      students' health behaviors; teachers' health-promoting behaviors can induce 
      students' healthy behaviors with their positive health outcomes. This study was an 
      examination of personal factors, situational factors, and health literacy as 
      influences on teachers' health-promoting behaviors. A hierarchical multiple 
      regression analysis was implemented based on an integrated model of health literacy. 
      The study results showed that health literacy was the strongest predictor of 
      teachers' health-promoting behaviors. In addition, school type and school culture 
      were situational factors related to the interpersonal relations and stress 
      management domains of the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II scale. These 
      findings could serve as foundational evidence for developing programs at the 
      individual and organizational levels that enhance teachers' health-promoting 
      behaviors.

TI  - Refugee and Migrant Health Literacy Interventions in High-Income Countries: A 
      Systematic Review.
LID - 10.1007/s10903-021-01152-4 [doi]
AB  - Health literacy is a key determinant of health in refugee and migrant populations 
      living in in high-income countries (HICs). We conducted a systematic review of 
      randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) to characterize the scope, methodology, and 
      outcomes of research on interventions aimed at improving health literacy among these 
      vulnerable populations. We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of 
      Science databases to identify RCTs of health literacy intervenions in our target 
      population published between 1997 and 2018. The search yielded 23 RCTs (n = 5625 
      participants). Study demographics, health literacy topics, interventions, and 
      outcome measures were heterogeneous but demonstrated overall positive results. Only 
      two studies used a common health literacy measure. Few RCTs have been conducted to 
      investigate interventions for improving the health literacy of refugees and migrants 
      in HICs. The heterogeniety of health literacy outcome measures used impeded a robust 
      comparison of intervention efficacy.

TI  - COVID-19 Misinformation Online and Health Literacy: A Brief Overview.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18158091 [doi]
LID - 8091
AB  - Low digital health literacy affects large percentages of populations around the 
      world and is a direct contributor to the spread of COVID-19-related online 
      misinformation (together with bots). The ease and 'viral' nature of social media 
      sharing further complicate the situation. This paper provides a quick overview of 
      the magnitude of the problem of COVID-19 misinformation on social media, its 
      devastating effects, and its intricate relation to digital health literacy. The main 
      strategies, methods and services that can be used to detect and prevent the spread 
      of COVID-19 misinformation, including machine learning-based approaches, health 
      literacy guidelines, checklists, mythbusters and fact-checkers, are then briefly 
      reviewed. Given the complexity of the COVID-19 infodemic, it is very unlikely that 
      any of these approaches or tools will be fully effective alone in stopping the 
      spread of COVID-19 misinformation. Instead, a mixed, synergistic approach, combining 
      the best of these strategies, methods, and services together, is highly recommended 
      in tackling online health misinformation, and mitigating its negative effects in 
      COVID-19 and future pandemics. Furthermore, techniques and tools should ideally 
      focus on evaluating both the message (information content) and the messenger 
      (information author/source) and not just rely on assessing the latter as a quick and 
      easy proxy for the trustworthiness and truthfulness of the former. Surveying and 
      improving population digital health literacy levels are also essential for future 
      infodemic preparedness.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to assess the levels and correlates of health literacy 
      among refugees. STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study design. METHODS: 
      Health literacy was assessed through face-to-face interviews in eight primary 
      healthcare centers (PHCs) in Mount Lebanon. The questionnaire consisted of the 
      Arabic Functional Health literacy scale, the short version of the European Health 
      Literacy Survey (HLS-EU-Q16), socio-economic questions (sex, age, nationality, 
      marital status, educational level, and ability to pay for medical fees at PHCs), and 
      health-related questions (self-perceived health, long-term illness, recent visit to 
      health care, and freedom to make health decisions). Statistical analyses were 
      performed to evaluate the association between functional health literacy (FHL), 
      comprehensive health literacy (CHL), and potential explanatory variables. RESULTS: 
      Of 263 participants (61.6% females), mean age 38.49 ± 12.80 years, 52.1% had 
      inadequate FHL and 35.7% had inadequate CHL. The likelihood of having inadequate CHL 
      was higher in refugees who were ever married (odds ratio [OR] = 2.794; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI]: 1.187-6.576) or had average ability to pay for medical 
      expenses at PHC (OR = 4.562; 95% CI: 1.554-13.393). The odds of having inadequate 
      FHL was lower in refugees with some level of education (OR = 0.211; 95% CI: 
      0.077-0.580). Furthermore, their perceived lack of freedom to make personal health 
      decisions was associated with inadequate levels of CHL (OR = 5.195; 95% CI: 
      2.693-10.022) and FHL (OR = 4.676; 95% CI: 2.610-8.376). CONCLUSIONS: Health 
      messages and delivery should be tailored to refugee health literacy levels. 
      Initiatives should seek to improve refugee interaction with the health system, 
      promote uptake of available health services and facilitate health-related 
      decision-making in daily life.

TI  - Health Literacy, Self-Perceived Health, and Substance Use Behavior among Young 
      People with Alcohol and Substance Use Disorders.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18084337 [doi]
LID - 4337
AB  - Licit and illicit substance use is one of the major public health issues with severe 
      negative health consequences for individuals and society. Health literacy is 
      essential for improving one's health and navigation in the healthcare system. 
      However, the evidence of health literacy in people with substance use disorders is 
      limited. This study aims to examine health literacy and its socio-demographic, 
      health-related, and substance use-related correlates in young people with alcohol 
      (AUD) and substance use disorders (SUD). In this study, cross-sectional data of 
      young people undergoing addiction treatment for AUD (N = 201, mean age 37.6) and SUD 
      (N = 165, mean age 31.1) were used. Health literacy was assessed using the 
      HLS-EU-Q47. Simple and multiple linear regression was performed to estimate the 
      correlates of health literacy. In total, 37.8% of participants with AUD and 41.8% of 
      SUD had limited health literacy. In participants with AUD, living condition factors, 
      self-perceived health indicators, and frequency of alcohol use showed a significant 
      effect on health literacy. In participants with SUD, financial factors, 
      self-perceived health indicators, and injection sharing showed a significant effect. 
      Increasing health literacy might contribute to improved health outcomes and 
      decreased high-risk substance use-related behavior in people undergoing addiction 
      treatment.

AB  - Health literacy is a key determinant of the public health and health climate of the 
      nation. This study examined the functional health literacy of the nation, factors 
      associated with health literacy, and its relationship with diabetes recognition. 
      This cross-sectional survey recruited participants (N = 2895) who were 18 years and 
      above from a population registry through disproportionate stratified sampling. The 
      Brief Health Literacy Screen and other questionnaires were administered through 
      face-to-face interviews, in one of the four national languages (English, Chinese, 
      Malay or Tamil). The majority (80.5%) had adequate functional health literacy and 
      were able to recognise symptoms of diabetes correctly (83.5% overall; 83.7% and 
      82.2% in those with adequate and inadequate health literacy, respectively). Those 
      with inadequate health literacy had a higher incidence of chronic conditions (p < 
      0.001) compared to those with adequate health literacy in bivariate analysis. The 
      majority of the sample had sufficient levels of physical activity (83.3%), and more 
      than half reported an unhealthy lifestyle (57.4%). Older age, Chinese ethnicity, 
      those who were employed, with lower education (secondary or below), and were married 
      had significantly higher odds of inadequate health literacy. Health literacy was not 
      associated with lifestyle, physical activity, chronic conditions and diabetes 
      recognition. Health literacy interventions should focus on the disadvantaged social 
      groups for improving their health literacy.

TI  - A scoping review of the role of health literacy in chronic kidney disease 
      self-management.
PG  - 221-233
LID - 10.1111/jorc.12364 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease is a serious health condition and is increasing 
      globally. Effective self-management could slow disease progression and improve 
      health outcomes, although the contribution of health literacy and knowledge for 
      self-management is not well known. AIM: To investigate the recent evidence of health 
      literacy and the relationship between health literacy, knowledge and self-management 
      of chronic kidney disease. METHODS: Arksey and O'Malley's framework informed this 
      scoping review. Eligible studies involving adults with any grade of chronic kidney 
      disease, measuring all dimensions of health literacy (i.e., functional, 
      communicative, and critical), disease-specific knowledge and self-management, 
      published in English between January 2005 and March 2020, were included. RESULTS: 
      The scoping review found 12 eligible studies, with 11 assessing all dimensions of 
      health literacy. No study examined health literacy, knowledge and self-management. 
      When individuals had greater health literacy, this was associated with greater 
      knowledge about the disease. Communicative health literacy was a significant 
      predictor of medication, diet and fluid adherence, and overall self-management 
      behaviours. CONCLUSION: This scoping review shows that disease-specific knowledge is 
      important for health literacy and that health literacy is essential for effective 
      self-management of chronic kidney disease. The implications of these relationships 
      can inform strategies for the development of evidence-based patient education to 
      support increased self-management. There is also a need for further research to 
      explore these associations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance of health literacy in dealing with the COVID-19 epidemic 
      has been emphasized but scarcely addressed empirically. In this study, the 
      association of health literacy with mental health, compliance with COVID-19 
      preventive measures and health prospects was assessed in a Belgian context. METHODS: 
      Data were extracted from the third of a series of cross-sectional online 
      COVID-related surveys (n = 32,794). Data collection took place for 1 week starting 
      the 28th of May 2020. People residing in Belgium and aged 18 years or older could 
      participate. Data were collected on sociodemographic background, health literacy, 
      multimorbidity, mental health (depression, anxiety, sleeping disorder, vitality), 
      knowledge about COVID-19, compliance with COVID-19 measures (hygiene, physical 
      distance, covering mouth and nose on public transport and in places where physical 
      distance cannot be respected), and health prospects (risk for health when returning 
      to normal life and possibility of infection). Prevalence Ratio (PR) of poor mental 
      health, non-compliance with the measures and health prospects in relation to health 
      literacy were calculated using Poisson regressions. RESULTS: People showing 
      sufficient health literacy were less likely to suffer from anxiety disorders 
      (PR = 0.47, 95% CI = [0.42-0.53]), depression (PR = 0.46, 95% CI = [0.40-0.52]) and 
      sleeping disorders (PR = 0.85, 95% CI = [0.82-0.87]), and more likely to have 
      optimal vitality (PR = 2.41, 95% CI = [2.05-2.84]) than people with low health 
      literacy. They were less at risk of not complying with the COVID-19 measures (PR 
      between 0.60 and 0.83) except one (covering mouth and nose in places where physical 
      distance cannot be respected). Finally, they were less likely to perceive returning 
      to normal life as threatening (PR = 0.70, 95% CI = [0.65-0.77]) and to consider 
      themselves at risk of an infection with COVID-19 (PR = 0.75, 95% CI = [0.67-0.84]). 
      The associations remained significant after controlling for COVID-19 knowledge and 
      multimorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that health literacy is a crucial 
      factor in managing the COVID-19 epidemic and offer a perspective for future studies 
      that target health literacy in the context of virus outbreaks.

LID - 10.1177/17423953211035472 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Self-management of chronic diseases is rather complex, especially for 
      patients with limited health literacy. In this review, we aim to disentangle the 
      specific difficulties patients with limited health literacy face in relation to 
      self-management and their associated needs with respect to self-management support. 
      METHODS: We performed a literature search in five databases. We used a broad 
      definition of health literacy and self-management was categorized into four types of 
      activities: medical management, changing lifestyle, communicating and navigating 
      through the health care system and coping. Included reviews described the 
      relationship between health literacy and different domains of self-management and 
      were published after 2010. RESULTS: A total of 28 reviews were included. Some clear 
      difficulties of patients with limited health literacy emerged, predominantly in the 
      area of medical management (especially adherence), communication and knowledge. 
      Other associations between health literacy and self-management were inconclusive. 
      Barriers from the patients' perspective described mainly medical management and the 
      communication and navigation of the health care system. DISCUSSION: Patients with 
      limited health literacy experience difficulties with specific domains of 
      self-management. For a better understanding of the relationship between health 
      literacy and self-management, a broader conceptualization of health literacy is 
      warranted, including both cognitive and behavioural aspects.

      information and make appropriate decisions and actions. The spread of the Internet 
      means that medical and drug information is becoming increasingly accessible to 
      patients. However, there is also a large amount of inappropriate and biased medical- 
      and drug-related information on the Internet. Therefore, patients require a high 
      level of health literacy to ensure the effectiveness and safety of pharmacotherapy. 
      In particular, outpatients need a high level of health literacy because they use 
      their own medications without the supervision of healthcare professionals. In this 
      article, I discuss the situation of health literacy and access to pharmaceutical 
      information on the Internet in Japan. Furthermore, issues related to providing drug 
      information to specific populations are explained using the example of chronic 
      kidney disease. It is essential for all pharmaceutical information stakeholders to 
      work together to solve these problems.

TI  - [Impact of health literacy on patient experience of outpatients in China and its 
      mechanism].
PG  - 560-565
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand the relationship between health literacy and patient 
      experience of outpatients in China, and to explore its mechanism. METHODS: The 
      conceptual framework was developed based on Andersen's behavioral model of health 
      services use and health literacy skills framework. An online cross-sectional survey 
      was conducted with snowball sampling method, while the health literacy was measured 
      by self-designed patient health literacy scale, and the patient experience was 
      measured by the Chinese patient experience questionnaire for ambulatory care 
      developed by Peking Union Medical College. And a structural equation model was built 
      to explore the relationship between them and test the mechanism of health literacy 
      influencing patient experience. RESULTS: A total of 2 773 subjects were 
      investigated. The average score of health literacy was (90.72±12.90) points, 
      accounting for 78.89% of the full score, and the dimension of seeking social support 
      had the lowest score. The average score of overall rating of patient experience was 
      (3.71±0.74) points, and the scores of each dimension of patient experience were 
      between 3.56 and 3.80. The model fit indices of structural equation model for 
      overall rating of patient experience among the outpatients were χ(2)/df=9.29 (χ(2)=4 
      107.27, df=442), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA)=0.055 (< 0.06), 
      comparative fit index (CFI)=0.926 (>0.90), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI)=0.918 (>0.90), 
      standardized root mean square residual (SRMR)=0.061 (< 0.08), the model was 
      acceptable. The variance in patient experience explained by the model was 0.108. The 
      structural equation model analysis results showed that the overall rating of 
      outpatient experience was directly affected by health literacy (β=0.263, P < 0.001), 
      also indirectly affected by health literacy (β=0.012, P < 0.001). In other words, 
      the overall rating increased by 0.275 units for each standard deviation increase of 
      health literacy. Self-evaluated health status mediated the relationship between 
      health literacy and the overall rating of outpatient experience. In terms of 
      diffe-rent dimensions of patient experience, the standardized path coefficient of 
      the total effect of health literacy on patient experience was as follows: 
      Information guidance 0.337, humanistic care 0.319, communication with doctors 0.294, 
      service efficiency 0.240, and hospital environment 0.173. CONCLUSION: The patients 
      with higher level of health literacy were more likely to have a better outpatient 
      experience in China, and the information guidance experience and humanistic care 
      experience were most affected by health literacy. And the communication and 
      information utilization ability had the greatest influence on patient experience.

AB  - Health education has continuously evolved and taken several distinctive forms over 
      the decades. The emergence of new concepts such as health promotion and health 
      literacy have helped to shape and refine our understanding of how the purpose, 
      content and methods of health education can adapt with to new public health methods 
      and priorities. Viewing health education through the lens of health literacy has 
      been particularly helpful in differentiating between traditional task-focused health 
      education, and skills-focused health education designed to develop more generic, 
      transferable skills. The advent of digital media has enabled unprecedented access to 
      health information but brought with it new challenges. Managing the volume of 
      available information, and assessing its quality and reliability have become 
      essential digital health literacy skills in the information age. As health educators 
      we need to continue to adapt our practices to these new opportunities and understand 
      the challenges that come with them.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to identify changes in health literacy (HL) and 
      associated variables during the first year following a kidney transplantation. 
      METHODS: A total of 196 transplant recipients were included in a prospective 
      follow-up study. The patients answered the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ) at 5 
      days, 8 weeks, 6 and 12 months following the kidney transplantation. Mixed linear 
      models were used to analyze changes in HL and backward elimination was used to 
      identify variables associated with HL. RESULTS: Two main patterns of change were 
      identified: a) HL increased during the first 8 weeks of close follow-up and b) in 
      several domains, the positive increase from 5 days to 8 weeks flattened out from 5 
      days to 6 and 12 months. Self-efficacy, transplant-related knowledge, and general 
      health were core variables associated with HL. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, HL increased 
      during the 8 weeks of close follow-up following the kidney transplantation, while 6 
      months seem to be a more vulnerable phase. Furthermore, low self-efficacy, less 
      knowledge, and low self-perceived health may represent vulnerable characteristics in 
      patients. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Future kidney transplant care should take into 
      account patients' access to and appraisal of health information and social support, 
      and draw attention to potentially vulnerable groups.

TI  - Health Literacy, Education, and Internal Consistency of Psychological Scales.
PG  - e245-e255
LID - 10.3928/24748307-20210728-01 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Measurement error might lead to biased estimates, causing ineffective 
      interventions and service delivery. Identifying measurement error of health-related 
      instruments helps develop accurate assessment of health-related constructs. 
      OBJECTIVE: We compared the internal consistency of eight psychological scales used 
      in health research in groups with adequate versus limited health literacy and in 
      groups with higher versus lower education. METHODS: Participants (N = 1,005) from a 
      nationally representative internet panel completed eight self-report scales: (1) 
      information avoidance, (2) cognitive causation, (3) unpredictability, (4) perceived 
      severity, (5) time orientation, (6) internal health locus of control, (7) need for 
      cognition, and (8) social desirability. The first four assess beliefs about diabetes 
      and colon cancer. We used the Newest Vital Sign to categorize participants' health 
      literacy (limited vs. adequate). We also categorized participants' education (high 
      school or less vs. more than high school). We compared the Cronbach's alpha for each 
      psychological scale between groups with different health literacy and education 
      levels using the Feldt test. KEY RESULTS: Among all the 13 subscales, scale internal 
      consistency was significantly lower among people with limited health literacy than 
      those with adequate health literacy for five subscales: information avoidance for 
      colon cancer (0.80 vs. 0.88), unpredictability of diabetes (0.84 vs. 0.88), 
      perceived severity for diabetes (0.66 vs. 0.75), need for cognition (0.63 vs. 0.82), 
      and social desirability (0.52 vs. 0.68). Internal consistency was significantly 
      lower among people who had a high school education or less than among those with 
      more than a high school education for four scales: perceived severity of diabetes 
      (0.70 vs. 0.75), present orientation (0.60 vs. 0.66), need for cognition (0.73 vs. 
      0.80), and social desirability (0.61 vs. 0.70). CONCLUSIONS: Several psychological 
      instruments demonstrated significantly lower internal consistency when used in a 
      sample with limited health literacy or education. To advance health disparities 
      research, we need to develop new scales with alternative conceptualizations of the 
      constructs to produce a measure that is reliable among multiple populations. [HLRP: 
      Health Literacy Research and Practice. 2021;5(3):e244-e255.] Plain Language Summary: 
      We compared the internal consistency of several psychological scales in groups with 
      adequate versus limited health literacy and higher versus lower education. For 
      several scales, internal consistency was significantly lower among (1) people with 
      limited health literacy compared those who have adequate health literacy and/or (2) 
      people who had a high school education or less compared to those with more than a 
      high school education.

TI  - Malaysian Health Literacy: Scorecard Performance from a National Survey.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18115813 [doi]
LID - 5813
AB  - Health literacy is an indicator of a society's ability to make better health 
      judgements for themselves and the people around them. This study investigated the 
      prevalence of health literacy among Malaysian adults and provided an overall picture 
      of the society's current health literacy status, which has not been previously 
      assessed. The study also highlighted socio-demographic markers of communities with 
      limited health literacy that may warrant future intervention. A population-based 
      self-administered survey using the Health Literacy Survey Malaysian Questionnaire18 
      (HLS-M-Q18) instrument was conducted as part of the National Health Morbidity Survey 
      2019 in Malaysia. The nationwide survey utilized a two-staged stratified random 
      sampling method. A sample of 9478 individuals aged 18 and above, drawn from the 
      living quarter list, participated in the study. The health literacy score was 
      divided into three levels; limited, sufficient, and excellent. Findings showed a 
      majority of the Malaysian population had a sufficient health literacy level in all 
      three domains-healthcare, diseases prevention and health promotion (49.1%, 44.2%, 
      and 47.5%, respectively)-albeit leaning towards the lower end of the category with 
      an average score of 35.5. The limited health literacy groups were prevalent among 
      respondents with older age (68%), lower education level (64.8%), and lower household 
      income (49.5%). The overall health literacy status for Malaysia was categorized at a 
      lower sufficiency level. Future health literacy improvements should focus on 
      communities with a limited health literacy level to improve the overall score.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Few studies have examined how health literacy impacts responses to 
      genetic information. METHODS: We examined this issue among 145 English or 
      Spanish-speaking adult primary care patients enrolled in a trial that offered 
      testing for MC1R gene variants that confer moderately increased melanoma risk. We 
      investigated whether health literacy skills, educational attainment, or melanoma 
      risk were related to short-term cognitive and affective responses to genetic test 
      results. RESULTS: On average, participants found the test results to be highly 
      believable and clear, with low levels of negative emotional responses and moderate 
      levels of positive responses. In adjusted models, health literacy skills were 
      significantly inversely associated with confusion (OR = 0.75, 95 % CI = 0.58, 0.96); 
      those with higher education thought significantly less about their test results 
      (β = -0.66), were less hopeful (β = -0.89), and had lower distress (β = -1.15). We 
      also observed a significant interaction (p < .001) between health literacy and 
      melanoma risk in affecting the frequency of thoughts about test results. CONCLUSION: 
      The findings indicate that health literacy skills may affect to what extent 
      individuals elaborate cognitively on genetic information. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: 
      Patients with lower health literacy skills or education may need support in 
      understanding genetic test results.

TI  - Social Support, Health Literacy and Depressive Symptoms among Medical Students: An 
      Analysis of Mediating Effects.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18020633 [doi]
LID - 633
AB  - Depressive symptoms are prevalent in university students and may impair their 
      social, educational, and economic transition into adulthood. Identifying the factors 
      that determine depressive symptoms is crucial for the design of effective policy 
      interventions. This study aims to examine the associations between health literacy 
      and depressive symptoms among medical students, and to evaluate the effect of 
      different types of social support as a potential mediator. A cross-sectional survey 
      of medical students was conducted through convenience sampling in East China. 
      Associations between variables were explored using OLS and the mediation effect was 
      estimated using the Karlson, Holm and Breen method. A total of 746 valid 
      questionnaires were collected. The prevalence of depressive symptoms among the 
      sample was 32.4%. Higher health literacy levels and social supports were 
      significantly associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms. Social support 
      partially mediated the association between health literacy and depressive symptoms, 
      accounting for a 54.03% of the total effect size. These findings suggest that 
      interventions for medical student mental wellbeing could improve health literacy. 
      Whilst family support reflects greatest impact, Universities can also lead and 
      innovate novel interventions for this critical stage of life. Future research can 
      extend this study by exploring the dynamic interactions between health literacy, 
      depressive symptoms, and other sources of social support. Comparisons of these 
      findings across the different regions of China and in other university subject 
      disciplines are also warranted.

TI  - The Relationship between E-Health Literacy and Health-Promoting Behaviors in Nursing 
      Students: A Multiple Mediation Model.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18115804 [doi]
LID - 5804
AB  - The availability of a wide range of online health-related information on the 
      internet has made it an increasingly popular source of health information, 
      particularly for people in their 20s. This study aimed to explore possible multistep 
      and indirect pathways of association between e-health literacy and health-promoting 
      behaviors through social media use for health information, online health 
      information-seeking behaviors, and self-care agency among nursing students. The 
      study included 558 nursing students from three different universities in South 
      Korea. Data were collected using structured questionnaires from 2 August to 29 
      August, 2019. The results show that e-health literacy had a significant direct 
      effect on health-promoting behaviors through the three mediators. Moreover, the 
      overall model explained 46% of the total variance in health-promoting behaviors. 
      Based on these findings, it is necessary to introduce interventions that improve 
      e-health literacy and develop a strategy to promote healthy behaviors. It is also 
      necessary to develop programs to improve e-health literacy competency in nursing 
      students. Moreover, health interventions that improve health-promoting behaviors 
      should be developed, and research to evaluate the effect of the interventions should 
      be conducted.

TI  - Low Health Literacy is Associated with the Onset of CKD during the Life Course.
PG  - 1436-1443
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2020081155 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health literacy, the ability to deal with information related to one's 
      health, is a predictor of health outcomes in CKD. However, research has not explored 
      whether low health literacy predicts the onset of CKD. METHODS: We used data from 
      participants of Lifelines, a prospective population-based cohort study of 
      individuals living in The Netherlands, to assess the share of individuals with low 
      health literacy by eGFR category, whether low health literacy is associated with CKD 
      onset in the general population and in the subgroup of older adults, and whether 
      established CKD risk factors mediate this association. RESULTS: In the total sample 
      of 93,885 adults (mean follow-up 3.9 years), low health literacy was more likely 
      among individuals in worse eGFR categories, increasing from 26.4% in eGFR category 1 
      to 50.0% in category 5 (P=0.02). Low health literacy, compared with adequate health 
      literacy, was associated with the onset of CKD in the total sample (3.0% versus 
      2.1%) and in the subgroup of older adults (13.4% versus 11.3%), with odds ratios 
      (ORs) of 1.44 (95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.31 to 1.59) and 1.21 (95% CI, 
      1.04 to 1.41), respectively. After adjustment for sex, age, education, and income, 
      health literacy was associated with CKD onset only in older adults (OR, 1.25; 95% 
      CI, 1.04 to 1.50). This association was mediated by hypertension and high body mass 
      index (BMI) in the crude model, but only by BMI after adjustment (with BMI 
      explaining 18.8% of the association). CONCLUSIONS: Low health literacy is a risk 
      factor for CKD onset among older adults, which suggests that CKD prevention might 
      benefit from strategies to address low health literacy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low levels of health literacy are associated with increased 
      hospitalization rates, problems regarding the proper intake of medications, poor 
      general health and increased mortality rates. It is a well-known fact that health 
      literacy differs among ethnic groups and ethnic minorities, in particular, are known 
      to have a low level of health literacy. The present study aimed to reveal the levels 
      of health literacy among different ethnic groups and the affecting factors as well 
      as the relationship between health literacy and health perceptions. METHODS: This 
      cross-sectional study was carried out with different ethnic groups (Kurdish, Arab, 
      Turkish and Assyrian origin), between 18 and 65 years old in the province of Mardin 
      in Turkey. The study was conducted with a total of 600 people. The European Health 
      Literacy Scale-Turkish Adaptation (EHLS-TR) and Health Perception Scale (HPS) were 
      used for measurement. Descriptive analysis, Mann Whitney U Test, Kruskal Wallis Test 
      and Spearman correlation were used in the data analysis. RESULTS: It was found that 
      80.7% of the participants had relatively low levels of health literacy. The lowest 
      levels of health literacy were among those of Kurdish origin. There were 
      correlations between sufficient levels of health literacy and several factors 
      including being of Assyrian origin, being 50-65 years old, living in a nuclear 
      family, being a secondary school graduate, having a high financial status, being 
      retired, evaluating one's own health status as good, obtaining health information 
      from healthcare professionals, preferring to visit a state hospital to seek medical 
      assistance first, smoking and drinking alcohol. A positive correlation was also 
      identified between the levels of health literacy and health perception. CONCLUSIONS: 
      It is essential to develop programs to increase health literacy for the public and, 
      in particular, for the ethnic groups that are disadvantaged in many aspects in the 
      context of health literacy.

      Meaningful Patient Engagement in Healthcare.
PG  - 521-524

AB  - Research into health literacy and shared decision-making has largely developed along 
      parallel, but distinct lines over the past two decades. There is little evidence 
      that the concepts and related practice have intersected except in the most 
      functional way, for example, to simplify shared decision-making tools by improving 
      readability scores of decision aids. This paper presents an integrated model to 
      strengthen and sustain patient engagement in health care by drawing on the strengths 
      of both concepts. This includes addressing patients' skills and capacities, 
      alongside modifications to written and verbal information. We propose an expanded 
      model of shared decision-making which incorporates health literacy concepts and 
      promotes two-tiered intervention methods to improve the targeting and 
      personalization of communication and support the development of transferable health 
      literacy skills among patients.

LID - 10.1177/0272684X211022572 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Supporting a child's healthy development is determined, in part, by a 
      parent's ability to seek, access, interpret and effectively utilize health 
      information. This aspect of parenting draws on a set of skills referred to as health 
      literacy. OBJECTIVE: To assess the level of health literacy among parents/carers in 
      a regional South Australian community. METHODS: Parents/carers of primary 
      school-aged children, residing in Whyalla, South Australia, were invited to complete 
      the 13-item All Aspects of Health Literacy Survey. RESULTS: 155 parents/carers 
      completed the survey (79% mothers). Most participants were English-speaking (97%), 
      employed (62%) and had 2-3 children (62%), with 52% completing tertiary education. 
      Median total health literacy scores were mostly in the moderate-high range (median 
      27, IQR 26,27), as were critical health literacy scores (median 7, IQR 6,8). Higher 
      scores were reported for functional health literacy (median 8, IQR 7,9), 
      communicative health literacy (median 9, IQR 8,9) and empowerment health literacy 
      (median 4, IQR 3,5). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal modest levels of health 
      literacy among a sample of parents/carers of primary school-aged children in a 
      regional South Australian community. Further work is needed to understand the 
      differential effect of parental health literacy on child health outcomes, and the 
      types of strategies that may mitigate the impact of these barriers on a child's 
      healthy development.

TI  - Engaging Women with Limited Health Literacy in Mammography Decision-Making: 
      Perspectives of Patients and Primary Care Providers.
PG  - 938-945
LID - 10.1007/s11606-020-06213-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited health literacy is a driver of cancer disparities and associated 
      with less participation in medical decisions. Mammography screening decisions are an 
      exemplar of where health literacy may impact decision-making and outcomes. 
      OBJECTIVE: To describe informational needs and shared decision-making (SDM) 
      experiences among women ages 40-54 who have limited health literacy and primary care 
      providers (PCPs). DESIGN: Qualitative, in-depth interviews explored experiences with 
      mammography counseling and SDM. PARTICIPANTS: Women ages 40-54 with limited health 
      literacy and no history of breast cancer or mammogram in the prior 9 months were 
      approached before a primary care visit at a Boston academic, safety-net hospital. 
      PCPs practicing at this site were eligible for PCP interviews. APPROACH: Interviews 
      were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A set of deductive codes for each 
      stakeholder group was developed based on literature and the interview guide. 
      Inductive codes were generated during codebook development. Codes were compared 
      within and across patient and PCP interviews to create themes relevant to 
      mammography decision-making. KEY RESULTS: The average age of 25 interviewed patients 
      was 46.5; 18 identified as black, 3 as Hispanic, 2 as non-Hispanic white, and 2 had 
      no recorded race or ethnicity. Of 20 PCPs, 15 were female; 12 had practiced for 
      >5 years. Patients described a lack of technical (appropriate tests and what they 
      do) and process (what happens during a mammogram visit) knowledge, viewing these as 
      necessary for decision-making. PCPs were reluctant to engage patients with limited 
      health literacy in SDM due to time constraints and feared that increased information 
      might confuse patients or deter them from having mammograms. Both groups felt 
      pre-visit education would facilitate mammography-related SDM during clinical visits. 
      CONCLUSION: Both patients and PCPs perceived a need for tools to relay technical and 
      process knowledge about mammography prior to clinical encounters to address the 
      scope of information that patients with limited health literacy desired.

PG  - 262-270
LID - 10.1080/02770903.2019.1672720 [doi]
AB  - Background: To investigate HL (health literacy) and eHealth literacy (eHL) among two 
      groups of asthma outpatients, those with prior asthma education and those without. 
      In addition, we aimed to compare two shortened versions of a HL measure 
      instrument.Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with a sample of adult 
      asthma patients (n = 129). Half of them had received asthma patient education prior 
      to the study (n = 64). The study collected demographic data, questions on HL 
      (HLS-EU-Q16) and eHL (eHEALS).Results: In the main analysis respondents' mean HL 
      values were almost identical in both groups, 11.9 (SD = 3.1) among trained and 11.8 
      (SD = 3.5) among untrained patients, demonstrating a problematic level of HL, 
      according to the instrument. In the subdivision of sum scores, the HL level of 
      trained patients was categorized more often as problematic (43%) than among 
      untrained patients (20%). Bland-Altman plots of the 6-item and 16-item versions of 
      the HLS-EU suggest only limited agreement between the versions. In terms of eHL, 
      trained patients showed a mean of 3.0 (SD = 1.1) and untrained patients a mean of 
      3.2 (SD = 1.0). Analysis of HL and eHL showed no difference between 
      groups.Conclusions: No consistent differences between groups were found, suggesting 
      that trained patients did not benefit from asthma education regarding HL and eHL. 
      The 6-item and 16-item versions of the HLS-EU were not easily interchangeable, 
      limiting its use in a busy outpatient practice.AbbreviationseHEALSElectronic Health

TI  - "The Way you Interpret Health": Adolescent Definitions and Perceptions of Health 
      Literacy.
PG  - 599-607
LID - 10.1111/josh.13050 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adolescents are required to take increased responsibility for their 
      health. Although health literacy is implicated in adults' health decision-making and 
      health behaviors, little is known about adolescents' health literacy and its 
      relationship to their health behaviors. Furthermore, adolescent health literacy 
      research overlooks adolescent development-specific needs and skills. Therefore, we 
      qualitatively explored adolescents' (1) definitions of health literacy, preventive 
      health behaviors, and health risk behaviors; and (2) perception of the health 
      literacy/health behavior relationship. METHODS: Six semi-structured focus groups 
      were conducted with adolescents (N = 37) who answered questions about their 
      perceptions of health literacy, preventive health behaviors, and health risk 
      behaviors. Focus groups were coded using thematic analysis. Themes representing 
      adolescents' definitions of health literacy were secondarily coded for alignment 
      with definitions in the literature. RESULTS: Some of adolescents' health literacy 
      definitions aligned with the adult health literacy literature. They considered 
      health literacy a tool for informed decision-making, but acknowledged not always 
      using these skills. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents' definitions of health literacy were 
      multidimensional, going beyond numeracy and literacy skills. Developmental 
      characteristics and adolescents' definition of health risk behaviors were related to 
      use of health literacy skills. Opportunities for adolescents to develop and practice 
      health literacy skills are discussed.

TI  - Health Literacy, Digital Health Literacy, and COVID-19 Pandemic Attitudes and 
      Behaviors in U.S. College Students: Implications for Interventions.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by rapidly emerging evidence, changing 
      guidance, and misinformation, which present new challenges for health literacy (HL) 
      and digital health literacy (DHL) skills. This study explored whether 
      COVID-19-related information access, attitudes, and behaviors were associated with 
      health literacy and digital health literacy among college students in the United 
      States. Self-reported measures of health literacy, along with items on 
      pandemic-related attitudes, behaviors, information sources, and social networks, 
      were collected online using a managed research panel. In July 2020, 256 responses 
      were collected, which mirrored the racial/ethnic and gender diversity of U.S. 
      colleges. Only 49% reported adequate HL, and 57% found DHL tasks easy overall. DHL 
      did not vary by HL level. In multivariable models, both HL and DHL were 
      independently associated with overall compliance with basic preventive practices. 
      Higher DHL, but not HL, was significantly associated with greater willingness to get 
      a COVID-19 vaccine and the belief that acquiring the disease would negatively impact 
      their life. On average, respondents discussed health with 4-5 people, which did not 
      vary by HL or DHL measures. The usage of online information sources varied by HL and 
      DHL. The study findings can inform future student-focused interventions, including 
      identifying the distinct roles of HL and DHL in pandemic information access, 
      attitudes, and behaviors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessment health literacy in people with cardiovascular health problems 
      would facilitate the development of appropriate health strategies for the care and 
      reduction of complications associated with oral anticoagulation therapy. AIM: To 
      evaluate the relationship between health literacy and health and treatment outcomes 
      (concordance with oral anticoagulants, Normalized Ratio control and occurrence of 
      complications) in patients with cardiovascular pathology. METHODS: Observational, 
      analytic and cross-sectional study carried out on 252 patients with cardiovascular 
      pathology (atrial fibrillation, flutter or valve prosthesis), aged 50-85 years, 
      accessing primary care services in Valencia (Spain) in 2018-2019. Variables 
      referring to anticoagulant treatment with vitamin K antagonists (years of treatment, 
      adequate control, polypharmacy and occurrence of complications, among others) and 
      health literacy (Health Literacy Questionnaire) were analysed. RESULTS: All 
      dimensions of health literacy were significantly related to the level of education 
      (p < 0.02), social class (p < 0.02), an adequate control of acenocoumarol 
      (p < 0.001), frequentation of health services (p < 0.001), information by patients 
      to health professionals about anticoagulant treatment (p < 0.03), emergency care 
      visits (p < 0.001) and unscheduled hospital admissions (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: 
      Health literacy has a relevant influence on the adequate self-management of 
      anticoagulation treatment and the frequency of complications. The different 
      dimensions that comprise health literacy play an important role, but the "social 
      health support" dimension seems to be essential for such optimal self-management.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the impact of health literacy on pain self-management 
      contexts, processes, and outcomes. METHODS: This systematic review employed a 
      narrative synthesis. We used databases, including PubMed and PsycINFO, and 
      handsearching of the reference lists to identify articles published before December 
      2020. Pain self-management variables were chosen based on the Individual and Family 
      Self-Management Theory. Quality was assessed using the National Institute of Health 
      quality assessment tool for observational and cross-sectional studies. RESULTS: 
      Twenty studies that included 6173 participants were used. Most studies measured 
      functional domains of the health literacy concept. Twelve studies reported small to 
      large associations between health literacy and pain knowledge, medication regimen 
      adherence, or pain. Thirteen studies considered health literacy clinical risks in 
      tailoring education, while seven viewed it as personal assets developed via 
      education. CONCLUSIONS: Limited information on the contribution of health literacy 
      to pain self-management context factors and processes exists. Current evidence was 
      limited by a lack of temporality, theoretical basis, and a priori sample estimation. 
      PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Using brief functional literacy scales in the clinical 
      environment can be more practical. Identifying patients' literacy levels helps 
      clinicians personalize education, which then promotes patients' knowledge of pain, 
      medication regimen adherence, and pain control.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if there is an association between self-reported health 
      literacy and rates of prostate cancer screening through PSA testing. METHODS: This 
      secondary data analysis utilized information from the 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor 
      Surveillance System (BRFSS). The primary exposure was self-reported health literacy, 
      and the primary outcome was whether patients underwent prior PSA testing. Males 
      55-69 years old from 13 states were included in the study and were excluded if they 
      had any missing data. Participants were categorized into low, moderate, or high 
      level of health literacy. Confounders were adjusted for using binary logistic 
      regression. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. 
      RESULTS: A total of 12,149 participants were included. Five percent of participants 
      reported low health literacy, 54% moderate health literacy, and 41% high health 
      literacy. Compared with study participants who self-reported high levels of health 
      literacy, the odds of undergoing PSA testing were 59% lower in those with low health 
      literacy (OR 0.41; 95% CI 0.28-0.64) and 30% lower in those with moderate health 
      literacy (OR 0.70; 95% CI 0.60-0.83). CONCLUSIONS: Our research demonstrates a 
      positive association between self-reported health literacy and the likelihood of PSA 
      screening. While PSA screening can be controversial, health literacy may serve as a 
      window into which patients are more likely to be proactive in their urologic care. 
      Future studies examining how health literacy effects other urologic conditions is 
      necessary.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clarify the impacts of health literacy on mortality, readmission, and 
      quality of life (QOL) in the secondary or tertiary prevention of cardiovascular 
      diseases (CVD) through a meta-analysis. METHODS: Six electronic databases were 
      searched on June 11, 2020. Observational studies involving patients with CVD, health 
      literacy as an exposure factor and mortality, readmission, or QOL as outcomes were 
      included in this study. Two researchers screened the retrieved articles and 
      extracted data independently. The meta-analysis calculated the pooled relative risk 
      of mortality and readmission. We also assessed the body of evidence based on Grading 
      of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). RESULTS: 
      Following screening of 1616 studies, 16 observational studies were included. The 
      mean rate of low health literacy was 32.8%. All studies focusing on QOL showed 
      significant impacts of health literacy. Pooled relative risk was 1.621 (95% 
      confidence interval: 1.089-2.412) for mortality and 1.184 (95% confidence interval: 
      1.035-1.355) for readmission, indicating significant effects of health literacy. 
      GRADE assessment showed "LOW" certainty for each outcome. CONCLUSION: Low health 
      literacy was significantly associated with increased mortality and hospital 
      readmission and decreased QOL in patients with CVD. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: 
      Considering low health literacy in clinical practice is very important to improve 
      prognosis of CVD patients.

AB  - ISSUE ADDRESSED: We developed and evaluated a health literacy training program for 
      allied health professionals, and explored the feasibility of a train-the-trainer 
      model to support dissemination. METHODS: The program combined didactic and 
      experiential teaching methods and behaviour change techniques, with a focus on 
      teach-back and developing easy-to-understand written materials. Outcomes included 
      participant reactions, confidence (range: 6-30), behavioural intentions (range: 
      6-42), and dissemination of training content. Implementation outcomes were evaluated 
      using the Normalization MeAsure Development (NoMAD) tool, assessing the constructs 
      of coherence (range: 4-20), cognitive participation (range: 4-20), collective action 
      (range: 7-35) and reflexive monitoring (range: 5-25). RESULTS: Of the 29 allied 
      health professionals who participated, 90% rated the program as 'excellent'/'very 
      good', and 97% said the information was 'extremely'/'very' helpful for their 
      everyday practice. We observed increases in confidence (mean difference [MD] = 6.3, 
      standard deviation [SD] = 2.7, t(25)  = 11.87, P < .001) and intentions (MD = 3.6, 
      SD = 8.1, t(23)  = 2.2, P = .04) related to health literacy practices after 6 weeks. 
      Improved confidence was retained over 6 months (MD = 7.1, SD = 5.2, t(18)  = 5.96, 
      P < .001). After 6 months, 95% of participants (n = 19) reported using teach-back 
      and 50% (n = 10) reported having used a readability formula. Eight-five per cent of 
      participants (17/20) had trained others in health literacy, reaching n = 201 allied 
      health professionals and students. NoMAD scores were highest in relation to 
      cognitive participation (/20) (M = 18.2, SD = 2.1) and lowest in relation to 
      collective action (/35) (M = 25.4, SD = 3.0). CONCLUSIONS: A train-the-trainer model 
      appears to be a feasible method to disseminate health literacy training, but 
      additional work may be needed to improve the collective work done to enable health 
      literacy practices in real-world clinical contexts. SO WHAT: Staff training is 
      particularly important in highly diverse areas where patients are disproportionately 
      affected by low health literacy.

AB  - Nowadays, the health level of residents has become the focus of people's attention. 
      Under the background of the development of health service from "disease-centered" to 
      "health-centered," it is very important to improve the level of urban health and 
      clarify the factors affecting urban health. Therefore, this paper quantifies the 
      relationship between residents' health literacy level and environment, average life 
      expectancy, infectious disease mortality, and other indicators by selecting 
      appropriate indicators and establishing a mathematical model. Based on the 
      reciprocal linear combination of the collected index data and the corresponding 
      health level value, the prediction model of social health literacy level (SPM) was 
      established, and the qualitative prediction and quantitative analysis of citizens' 
      health literacy level were studied in depth. Based on the SPM model, we can roughly 
      predict the level of health literacy in a region only based on the main variables 
      identified in this paper. The consistency of the experiment shows that the model is 
      effective and robust, and it reveals that environmental factors are the most 
      important factors affecting residents' health literacy level. The actual data show 
      that THE SPM model is a timely and reasonable framework to measure the health 
      literacy level of residents.

AB  - This article synthesizes what is known about the relationship between social 
      disadvantage and measures of health literacy (HL), and reviews the research 
      examining whether low HL is an explanatory factor connecting social disadvantage, 
      health outcomes, and health disparities. Written from a United States perspective, 
      this article offers a novel conceptual framework that presents how the social 
      determinants of health might interact with HL to result in health disparities. The 
      framework articulates relationships that reflect public health pathways and health 
      care pathways, which include their related health literacies. The article continues 
      with several cautionary statements based on the inherent limitations of current HL 
      research, including problems and concerns specific to the attribution of HL as an 
      explanatory factor for extant socioeconomic and racial/ethnic health disparities. 
      The article closes with recommendations regarding future research directions. [HLRP: 
      Health Literacy Research and Practice. 2021;5(3):e233-e243.] Plain Language Summary: 
      Socially disadvantaged populations have worse health and health literacy compared to 
      privileged populations. Scientists, health care providers, and policymakers are 
      interested in the possible role health literacy plays in explaining health 
      differences. The article reviews our current understandings of whether and how 
      population characteristics and related exposures to risk interact with low health 
      literacy to generate worse health to inform interventions.

AB  - CONTEXT: Colombia passed Law 100 in 1993 with the goal of providing universal health 
      care coverage, and by 2013, over 96% of the Colombian population had health 
      insurance coverage. However, little is known about how health-related quality of 
      life (HRQoL) and health literacy are related among those with the two most common 
      types of health insurance coverage: subsidized (those with lower incomes) and 
      contributory (those with higher incomes) coverage. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: In the 
      current exploratory investigation, data from adults visiting six primary care 
      clinics in Colombia were analysed to examine the relationship between HRQoL 
      (assessed as problems with mobility, self-care, completing usual activities, 
      pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), demographics, the two health insurance 
      types, and health literacy. Analyses also assessed whether, within insurance types, 
      health literacy was related to HRQoL. RESULTS: Results showed that those with 
      contributory health insurance coverage had greater health literacy than those with 
      subsidized coverage, and this was accounted for by differences in education and 
      socioeconomic status. HRQoL did not differ by insurance type. Although lower health 
      literacy was related to worse HRQoL in the overall sample, in subgroup analyses 
      lower health literacy significantly related to worse HRQoL only among those with 
      subsidized health insurance coverage. CONCLUSION: Targeting skills which contribute 
      to health literacy, such as interpreting medical information or filling out forms, 
      may improve HRQoL, particularly in those with subsidized insurance coverage.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health literacy and access to care are critical facilitators for 
      preventive health behaviors. After the passage of the Affordable Care Act in March 
      2010, little has been studied about how improved health insurance coverage has 
      impacted the use of preventive health services among Korean Americans. OBJECTIVE: 
      The study assessed the impact of access to care, use of services, and health 
      literacy on cancer screening among Korean Americans. METHODS: A descriptive 
      cross-sectional study of 377 Korean Americans age 18 years and older was conducted 
      with a survey and convenient sampling in Texas. KEY RESULTS: Although 79% of the 
      sample had health insurance, 32% had never visited a health care provider, and 14% 
      were delayed in care in the past 12 months. Only 11.6% were confident to complete 
      medical forms, and 69.5% had limited levels of confidence. Cancer screening 
      compliance rates were: mammography (50.4% at age 40-54 years; 46.6% at age 55 years 
      and older), a Pap smear (29.4% at age 21-29 years; 78.4% at age 30-65 years; 72.2% 
      at age 66 years and older), and colorectal cancer screening at age 45 years and 
      older (stool tests 15.1%; sigmoidoscopy 27%; colonoscopy 51.3%). Multiple logistic 
      regression analyses revealed that household income, gender, health insurance, and 
      health literacy were significantly associated with self-reported cancer screening. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Korean Americans who participated in this study are characterized by 
      marginalized health literacy, underused health care services, and significantly 
      lower cancer screening compliance than the goals of Healthy People 2020. The 
      following interventions are suggested to improve health literacy and health 
      insurance literacy on cancer screening: culturally sensitive and linguistically 
      appropriate education for the guidelines concordant with cancer screening, effective 
      communication skills with health care providers, support for navigating the health 
      care system, and development of internet- or social media-based health education 
      programs to meet the preferred communication methods of this population. [HLRP: 
      Health Literacy Research and Practice. 2021;5(4):e310-e318.] Plain Language Summary: 
      Despite having improved health insurance coverage, Korean Americans of this study 
      have marginalized health literacy, limited health insurance literacy, low cancer 
      screening compliance, and underused health care services. The results of this study 
      suggest several strategies to improve health literacy and health insurance literacy 
      for Korean Americans, which may also apply to other groups with similar barriers.

LID - 10.1097/NNR.0000000000000519 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cultural background, language, and literacy are factors that may affect 
      access, healthcare utilization, and cancer screening behaviors. OBJECTIVE: This 
      study aimed to characterize health literacy among Spanish-preferring Hispanic/Latino 
      individuals ages 50-75 and examine associations between sociodemographic 
      characteristics, health beliefs, and health literacy. METHODS: Participants 
      self-identified as Hispanic/Latino, preferring health information in Spanish, were 
      ages 50-75 years old, at average risk for colorectal cancer (CRC), not up to date 
      with CRC screening, and enrolled in a CRC screening education intervention trial. 
      Sociodemographic characteristics, health beliefs, and health literacy (i.e., 
      difficulty understanding written health information and confidence completing health 
      forms) were assessed at baseline. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were 
      performed. RESULTS: Fifty-three percent of participants reported either sometimes 
      having difficulty or always having difficulty with written health information, and 
      25% reported always asking for help or being not so confident in completing health 
      forms. Univariate predictors of adequate health literacy for written health 
      information were lower cancer worry and lower religious beliefs. Higher educational 
      attainment predicted confidence in completing health forms. CONCLUSIONS: Findings 
      highlight the need for interventions that address health beliefs and health literacy 
      among Hispanic/Latino patients who have low confidence in completing written forms 
      and difficulty understanding written information and reinforce the use of plain 
      language and salient design features when developing patient education materials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health literacy is essential to self-care, which is an important 
      precedence to improve the quality of healthcare services and a key factor in health. 
      It also plays a pivotal role in decision-making in various health fields. Therefore, 
      policymakers consider health literacy to be a primary tool to promote community 
      health and enhance the proper use of healthcare services. The present study aimed to 
      assess the health literacy status of the Kurdish population in Kurdistan province, 
      Iran based on the nine constructs of the Iranian health literacy questionnaire 
      (IHLQ) individually and collectively and determine the significant effects of 
      demographic variables on health literacy. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was 
      conducted on the Iranian adult Kurdish population living in the urban and rural 
      areas of Kurdistan province, willing to participate during April 2017-September 
      2018. Data were collected using the IHLQ. The sample size was determined to be 980 
      people, with 490 in the rural areas and 490 in the urban areas. The researchers 
      visited potential participants at their doorstep, asking them to complete the 
      questionnaire. The willing participants were assisted in completing the IHLQ in case 
      they were illiterate; the questions and answers were read by the researchers to the 
      participants, and the responses were recorded. RESULTS: About 50.4% (n = 494) of the 
      Kurdish population had poor health literacy, while 34.0% (n = 333) had average 
      health literacy, and 15.6% (n = 153) had good health literacy. Meanwhile, 60.2% of 
      the participants obtained poor scores in the construct of health information access, 
      and 74.1% (n = 726) obtained poor scores in the individual empowerment construct. In 
      addition, the analysis of the adjusted model indicated that education level (lowest 
      β = 7.42; P = 0.001) and in male participants (β = - 1.10; P = 0.001) were 
      significantly associated with higher health literacy. CONCLUSION: According to the 
      results, the investigated Kurdish population mostly had average or low health 
      literacy. Therefore, proper strategies should be adopted to enhance the health 
      literacy of this population and increase their access to health information. 
      Furthermore, effective training should be provided to these individuals (especially 
      vulnerable social groups) to improve their individual capabilities to compensate for 
      poor health literacy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of patients with nonurgent health conditions using emergency 
      departments (ED) is growing steadily. It is unclear however whether this is 
      associated with limited health literacy of patients. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to 
      explore the health literacy of patients with nonurgent conditions in an ED, compare 
      it with the health literacy of the general population and identify relationships 
      between health literacy and patients' views on emergency care. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: A total of 448 patients with nonurgent conditions participated in 
      a cross-sectional survey in the ED of a German university hospital. RESULTS: The 
      study shows that health literacy of nonurgent emergency patients is significantly 
      lower than the health literacy of the German population. Patients with lower levels 
      of health literacy perceive higher treatment urgency, are significantly less 
      informed about treatment options other than the ED and are more likely to visit the 
      ED or the outpatient walk-in practice for a second opinion after having seen their 
      general practitioner. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a need for action to improve 
      health literacy in Germany. In particular, current structural changes in emergency 
      care in Germany have to be considered.

AB  - OBJECTIVE(S): To compare the health literacy (HL) of the adult females with SUI 
      complaints in terms of their acceptance or non-acceptance of surgery. METHODS: In 
      this cohort study, the European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire (HLS-EU- Q47) 
      scores as a measure of health literacy were compared among the two groups of 
      patients who accepted to undergo surgery for SUI and the ones who did not. 
      Demographic features, weight and BMI values, comorbidity, menopausal status, 
      duration and type of UI, socioeconomic characteristics (marital status, educational 
      level, level of income) and HLS-EU- Q47 survey results of the two groups were 
      compared. We also investigated the reasons regarding the acceptance or refusal of 
      SUI surgery. RESULTS: Among the patients who were offered surgery 474% accepted to 
      undergo operation. Total HLS-EU-Q47 score was 30.04 in the group of patients who 
      accepted surgery and 23.46 in the group who refused surgery. The patients that 
      refused surgery had more often insufficient health literacy level (p=0.001). An 
      excellent health literacy level was higher for patients who agreed to 
      anti-incontinence surgery (p=0.021). CONCLUSIONS: Health literacy score of patients 
      with urinary incontinence (UI) who refused surgery was lower than those who accepted 
      surgery. Acceptance of surgery may be increased by providing more understandable and 
      clear information, especially for women with lower HL levels.

TI  - Associations of Health Literacy with Blood Pressure and Dietary Salt Intake among 
      Adults: A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/nu13124534 [doi]
LID - 4534
AB  - Health literacy has been recognized as a significant social determinant of health, 
      defined as the ability to access, understand, appraise, and apply health-related 
      information across healthcare, disease prevention, and health promotion. This 
      systematic review aims to understand the relationship between health literacy, blood 
      pressure, and dietary salt intake. A web-based search of PubMed, Web of Science, 
      CINAHL, ProQuest, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Prospero was performed using 
      specified search/MESH terms and keywords. Two reviewers independently performed the 
      data extraction and analysis, cross-checked, reviewed, and resolved any 
      discrepancies by the third reviewer. Twenty out of twenty-two studies met the 
      inclusion criteria and were rated as good quality papers and used in the final 
      analysis. Higher health literacy had shown to have better blood pressure or 
      hypertension knowledge. However, the relationship between health literacy with 
      dietary salt intake has shown mixed and inconsistent findings. Studies looking into 
      the main four domains of health literacy are still limited. More research exploring 
      the links between health literacy, blood pressure, and dietary salt intake in the 
      community is warranted. Using appropriate and consistent health literacy tools to 
      evaluate the effectiveness of salt reduction as health promotion programs is 
      required.

TI  - Inclusion of Health Disparities, Cultural Competence, and Health Literacy Content in 
      US and Canadian Pharmacy Curriculums.
PG  - 8200
LID - 10.5688/ajpe8200 [doi]
LID - 8200
AB  - Objective. To determine how US and Canadian pharmacy schools include content related 
      to health disparities and cultural competence and health literacy in curriculum as 
      well as to review assessment practices.Methods. A cross-sectional survey was 
      distributed to 143 accredited and candidate-status pharmacy programs in the United 
      States and 10 in Canada in three phases. Statistical analysis was performed to 
      assess inter-institutional variability and relationships between institutional 
      characteristics and survey results.Results. After stratification by institutional 
      characteristics, no significant differences were found between the 72 (50%) 
      responding institutions in the United States and the eight (80%) in Canada. A core 
      group of faculty typically taught health disparities and cultural competence content 
      and/or health literacy. Health disparities and cultural competence was primarily 
      taught in multiple courses across multiple years in the pre-APPE curriculum. While 
      health literacy was primarily taught in multiple courses in one year in the pre-APPE 
      curriculum in Canada (75.0%), delivery of health literacy was more varied in the 
      United States, including in a single course (20.0%), multiple courses in one year 
      (17.1%), and multiple courses in multiple years (48.6%). Health disparities and 
      cultural competence and health literacy was mostly taught at the introduction or 
      reinforcement level. Active-learning approaches were mostly used in the United 
      States, whereas in Canada active learning was more frequently used in teaching 
      health literacy (62.5%) than health disparities and cultural competence (37.5%). Few 
      institutions reported providing professional preceptor development.Conclusion. The 
      majority of responding pharmacy schools in the United States and Canada include 
      content on health disparities and cultural competence content and health literacy to 
      varying degrees; however, less is required and implemented within experiential 
      programs and the co-curriculum. Opportunities remain to expand and apply information 
      on health disparities and cultural competence content and health literacy content, 
      particularly outside the didactic curriculum, as well as to identify barriers for 
      integration.

TI  - Organizational Health Literacy in a Hospital-Insights on the Patients' Perspective.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph182312646 [doi]
LID - 12646
AB  - Health literacy-sensitive communication has been found to be an important dimension 
      of organizational health literacy measured from the patients' perspective. Little is 
      known about the role of health literacy-sensitive communication in complex care 
      structures. Therefore, our aim was to assess which hospital characteristics (in 
      terms of process organization) and patient characteristics (e.g., age, chronic 
      illness, etc.) contribute to better perceptions of health literacy-sensitive 
      communication, as well as whether better health literacy-sensitive communication is 
      associated with better patient reported experiences. Data were derived from a 
      patient survey conducted in 2020 in four clinical departments of a university 
      hospital in Germany. Health literacy-sensitive communication was measured with the 
      HL-COM scale. Data from 209 patients (response rate 24.2%) were analyzed with a 
      structural equation model (SEM). Results revealed that no patient characteristics 
      were associated with HL-COM scores. Better process organization as perceived by 
      patients was associated with significantly better HL-COM scores, and, in turn, 
      better HL-COM scores were associated with more patient-reported social support 
      provided by physicians and nurses as well as fewer unmet information needs. 
      Investing into good process organization might improve health literacy-sensitive 
      communication, which in turn has the potential to foster the patient-provider 
      relationship as well as to reduce unmet information needs of patients.

PG  - 209
LID - 10.1186/s12939-021-01528-w [doi]
LID - 209
AB  - BACKGROUND: Does higher health literacy lead to higher trust in public hospitals? 
      Existing literature suggests that this is the case since a positive association 
      between the level of health literacy and the level of trust in physicians and the 
      health care system has been shown. This study aims to challenge this assumption. 
      METHODS: Based on theoretical arguments from game theory and analysis of empirical 
      data, we argue that the association is better described as an inversely u-shaped 
      curve, suggesting that low and high levels of health literacy lead to a lower level 
      of trust than a medium level of health literacy does. The empirical analysis is 
      based on a study of the Danes' relationship to the overall health care system. More 
      than 6000 Danes have been asked about their overall expectations of the health 
      service, their concrete experiences and their attitudes to a number of change 
      initiatives. RESULTS: Game theory analysis show that the combined perceived 
      cooperation and benefit effects can explain an inversely u-shaped relationship 
      between social groups and trust in the health care system. Based on quantitative, 
      binary regression analyses of empirical data, the lowest degree of trust is found 
      among patients from the lowest and highest social groups, while the highest degree 
      of trust is found in the middle group. The main driver for this result is that while 
      patients having low health literacy perceive that the health care system is not 
      cooperative, patients with a high level of health literacy have high expectations 
      about the quality, which the health care system might not be able to provide. This 
      reduces the perceived benefit from their encounter with the health care system. 
      CONCLUSION: It is important that health care professionals understand that some 
      patient groups have a higher chance of cooperation (e.g., agreeing on the choice of 
      treatment) or defection (e.g. passing a complaint) than others. In perspective, 
      future research should undertake further qualitative examinations of possible 
      patient types and their demands in relation to different health care sectors, 
      focusing specifically on the opportunities to improve the handling of different 
      patient types.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pregnancy is a vulnerable period that affects long-term health of 
      pregnant women and their unborn infants. Health literacy plays a crucial role in 
      promoting healthy behaviour and thereby maintaining good health. This study explores 
      the role of health literacy in the GeMuKi (acronym for 'Gemeinsam Gesund: Vorsorge 
      plus für Mutter und Kind'-Strengthening health promotion: enhanced check-up visits 
      for mother and child) Project. It will assess the ability of the GeMuKi lifestyle 
      intervention to positively affect health literacy levels through active 
      participation in preventive counselling. The study also explores associations 
      between health literacy, health outcomes, health service use and effectiveness of 
      the intervention. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The GeMuKi trial has a hybrid 
      effectiveness-implementation design and is carried out in routine prenatal health 
      service settings in Germany. Women (n=1860) are recruited by their gynaecologist 
      during routine check-up visits before 12 weeks of gestation. Trained healthcare 
      providers carry out counselling using motivational interviewing techniques to 
      positively affect health literacy and lifestyle-related risk factors. Healthcare 
      providers (gynaecologists and midwives) and women jointly agree on Specific, 
      Measurable, Achievable Reasonable, Time-Bound goals. Women will be invited to fill 
      in questionnaires at two time points (at recruitment and 37th-40th week of 
      gestation) using an app. Health literacy is measured using the German version of the 
      Health Literacy Survey-16 and the Brief Health Literacy Screener. Lifestyle is 
      measured with questions on physical activity, nutrition, alcohol and drug use. 
      Health outcomes of both mother and child, including gestational weight gain (GWG) 
      will be documented at each routine visit. Health service use will be assessed using 
      social health insurance claims data. Data analyses will be conducted using IBM SPSS 
      Statistics, version 26.0. These include descriptive statistics, tests and regression 
      models. A mediation model will be conducted to answer the question whether health 
      behaviour mediates the association between health literacy and GWG. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the University Hospital of Cologne Research 
      Ethics Committee (ID: 18-163) and the State Chamber of Physicians in 
      Baden-Wuerttemberg (ID: B-F-2018-100). Study results will be disseminated through 
      (poster) presentations at conferences, publications in peer-reviewed journals and 
      press releases. TRAIL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00013173).

TI  - Change in Health Literacy over a Decade in a Prospective Cohort of 
      Community-Dwelling Older Adults.
PG  - 916-922
LID - 10.1007/s11606-020-06423-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health literacy is often viewed as a static trait in longitudinal 
      studies, which may over or underestimate an individual's ability to manage one's 
      health. OBJECTIVES: We sought to examine health literacy over time among older 
      adults using three widely used measures. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling adults ages 55 to 74 at baseline with at least one 
      follow-up visit (N = 656) recruited from one academic internal medicine clinic and 
      six community health centers in Chicago, IL. MEASURES: Health literacy was measured 
      using the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA), Newest Vital Sign 
      (NVS), and Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) at baseline and up 
      to three follow-up time points. RESULTS: In unadjusted analyses, significant changes 
      since baseline were found beginning at the second follow-up (mean (M) = 6.0 years, 
      SD = 0.6) for the TOFHLA (M = - 0.9, SD = 0.95, p = 0.049) and the REALM (M = 0.3, 
      SD = 2.5, p = 0.004) and at the last follow-up (M = 8.6 years, SD = 0.5) for the NVS 
      (M = - 0.2, SD = 1.4, p = 0.02). There were non-linear effects of baseline age on 
      TOFHLA and NVS scores over time (piecewise cubic spline p = 0.01 and p < 0.001, 
      respectively) and no effect on REALM scores (B = 0.02, 95% CI - 0.01 to 0.04, p = 
      0.17) using multivariable mixed-effects linear regression models, controlling for 
      race, education, income, and comorbidity. CONCLUSION: We found a negative 
      relationship between age and health literacy over time as measured by the TOFHLA and 
      NVS. Health literacy barriers appear to be more prevalent among individuals in later 
      life, when self-care demands are similarly increasing. Clinicians might consider 
      strategies to assess and respond to limited health literacy, particularly among 
      patients 70 and older. REALM performance remained stable over 10 years of follow-up. 
      This questions whether health literacy tools measure the same attribute. Prospective 
      health literacy studies should carefully consider what measures to use, depending on 
      their objective.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of low health literacy in Hebei Province 
      of China, and to investigate its socio-demographic risk factors.This study was a 
      community-based, cross-sectional questionnaire survey with a multiple-stage 
      randomization design and a sample size of 10,560. Participants' health literacy 
      status was evaluated by a questionnaire based on the 2012 Chinese Resident Health 
      Literacy Scale. Meanwhile, participants' socio-demographic characteristics were also 
      collected by the questionnaire.A total of 9952 participants provided valid 
      questionnaires and were included in the final analyses. The mean health literacy 
      score was 63.1 ± 17.1 points; for its subscales, the mean basic knowledge and 
      concepts score, lifestyle score, health-related skills score were 31.7 ± 9.0, 
      17.2 ± 4.8, 14.3 ± 4.1, respectively. Meanwhile, low health literacy prevalence was 
      81.0%; for its subscales, low basic knowledge and concepts prevalence (70.6%) was 
      numerically reduced compared to low lifestyle prevalence (87.4%) and low 
      health-related skills prevalence (86.1%). Further analyses showed that age, male, 
      and rural area were positively associated, but education level and annual household 
      income were negatively associated with low health literacy prevalence. Further 
      multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that higher age, male, lower 
      education level, lower annual household income, and rural area were closely 
      correlated with the risks of low total health literacy or low health literacy in 
      subscales in Hebei Province.The prevalence of low health literacy is 81.0% in Hebei 
      Province. Meanwhile, higher age, male, lower education level, lower annual household 
      income, and rural area closely associate with low health literacy risk.

TI  - How does health literacy affect the utilization of basic public health services in 
      Chinese migrants?
LID - daab040 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/heapro/daab040 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies have focused on the determinants of basic public health services 
      utilization, such as socioeconomic status and mobility characteristics, rather than 
      on health literacy. Thus, this study aimed to estimate the effect of health literacy 
      on the utilization of basic public health services among Chinese migrants. Based on 
      the 2016 China Migrants Dynamic Survey data (N = 2335), this study used propensity 
      score matching approach to estimate the effect of health literacy on the utilization 
      of basic public health services, including the establishment of health records and 
      receipt of health education, and to explore heterogeneity in this effect based on 
      educational attainment and urban-rural status. The findings show that high levels of 
      health literacy increased the probability of establishing health records and 
      receiving more health education. Also, high levels of health literacy had a positive 
      effect on the utilization of basic public health services among Chinese migrants, 
      especially those with less education or living in urban areas. Policy makers should 
      more carefully consider the actual situation and needs of migrants who are living in 
      urban areas or have less education, constructing more targeted service programs.

AB  - Intercultural competence (ICC) and health literacy (HL) are vital components of 
      patient education. The purpose of this study was to determine if an educational 
      intervention that combined ICC and HL was effective at changing second-year nursing 
      students' self-efficacy, beliefs, and knowledge. A total of 157 second-year nursing 
      students in two different programs participated in pre- and post-surveys consisting 
      of the Transcultural Self-Efficacy Tool and Health Literacy Beliefs and Knowledge 
      survey. Students attended a two-part lecture with a moderated panel on ICC and 
      health literacy and began clinical fieldwork. Results were analyzed using Wilcoxon 
      signed-rank test and Pearson correlation. There was a statistically significant 
      difference in all ICC subscales after an educational intervention and clinical 
      fieldwork (cognitive z = 7.681, p < .001; practical z = 7.319, p < .001; affective z 
      = 6.533, p < .001). HL knowledge and belief measures showed statistically 
      significant difference after the intervention (z = 3.037, p < .001). There was a 
      statistically significant correlation between intercultural self-efficacy and HL 
      beliefs (Pearson's r = .486, p < .001). Self-efficacy in ICC and beliefs and 
      knowledge in HL increased over time for nursing students, indicating that it may be 
      beneficial to train students about these two constructs simultaneously. [HLRP:

AB  - Health literacy is important for the management of chronic cardiovascular diseases. 
      Comprehensive studies related to health literacy of cardiac patients are limited. 
      The aims of this study were to determine the determinants of health literacy and its 
      effects on patient outcomes in cardiology patients. The European Health Literacy 
      Survey Questionnaire (HLS-EU-Q- 47 items) was applied to 530 patients who presented 
      to cardiology polyclinics of a university hospital in Ankara. Correlation 
      coefficients, univariate and multi-linear regression analyses were used in the 
      study. Determinants of health literacy were sex, education level, place of residence 
      and perception of social status (p < .05). Although adjustments were made based on 
      relevant control variables in multivariate analyses, health literacy was found to 
      affect 14 of 26 patient outcomes within the scope of the study (p < .05). Higher 
      education level and perception of social status, residing in the city center and 
      being female were among the determinants of high health literacy. Higher health 
      literacy was associated with more positive patient outcomes. Health literacy 
      affected health behaviors and risks, drug use habits, health status, use of 
      preventive health services and patient satisfaction.

TI  - Relationships between health literacy and quality of life among survivors with 
      breast cancer.
PG  - e12922
LID - 10.1111/ijn.12922 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: During the survival period of breast cancer patients, an understanding of 
      and ability to implement health knowledge may be important for survivors' physical 
      and mental quality of life (QOL). This study aims to investigate the health literacy 
      and predictors of QOL for survivors of breast cancer. METHOD: A cross-sectional 
      design was used, and convenience sampling was performed. Eighty-six survivors with 
      breast cancer were recruited from a general hospital in northern Taiwan from 
      February to August 2017. Taiwan's health literacy scale and SF-12 questionnaire were 
      used for data collection. RESULTS: The average health literacy score was 3.28. 
      Education level and breast cancer stage were significant factors for the health 
      literacy of survivors with breast cancer. Age, body mass index and health literacy 
      were predictors of physical health-related QOL. Health literacy also was a predictor 
      of mental health-related QOL. CONCLUSION: The results provide the factors associated 
      health literacy as well as health-related QOL. Nurses should understand the health 
      literacy among survivors with breast cancer and improve health literacy to optimize 
      their quality of life.

TI  - The health literacy disparity in adolescents with sickle cell disease.
PG  - e12353
LID - 10.1111/jspn.12353 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: There are over 100,000 individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) in the 
      United States, most of whom are Black, poor, and publically insured. In combination 
      with a chronic illness, these demographics lead to significant barriers to 
      healthcare for patients with SCD, leaving them exceptionally vulnerable within the 
      healthcare system. This unique vulnerability is especially notable when 
      transitioning adolescents with SCD from pediatric to adult care, as this is a 
      significant time of morbidity and mortality for these patients. It is postulated 
      that health literacy influences transition from pediatric to adult care in 
      adolescents with SCD. To better understand this relationship, more adolescent health 
      literacy research must be conducted with both adolescents with and without SCD. 
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to systematically compare health literacy in 
      adolescents with and without SCD. DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, 
      descriptive, exploratory study. One hundred and thirty-four adolescents with SCD and 
      105 adolescents without SCD were recruited for this study. The Newest Vital Sign 
      (NVS) health literacy instrument was used to evaluate health literacy. Pearson 
      correlations were conducted to evaluate relationships among health literacy and the 
      influencing factors of age, grade level, income, and parental education level. 
      Differences in NVS scores between groups were assessed using independent samples t 
      tests. RESULTS: There was a significant relationship between health literacy, age 
      (r = .286, p < .01) and grade level (r = .317, p = .00) in adolescents with SCD. In 
      adolescents without SCD, there was a significant relationship between health 
      literacy, income (r = .235; p < .05) and parental education (r = .263; p < .01). The 
      mean NVS score was 2.66 for adolescents with SCD and 3.77 for adolescents without 
      SCD. A statistically significant difference in NVS scores was found between groups 
      (t = 4.772; p < .001). Adolescents with SCD demonstrated significantly lower NVS 
      scores than adolescents without SCD. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: There are significant 
      differences in health literacy scores and influencing factors in adolescents with 
      and without SCD. Thus, this article provides unique insight for nurses as they 
      design, implement and evaluate health promotion, patient education, and future 
      research initiatives for adolescents and families, both with and without SCD. 
      Further research is needed to gain more insight into this phenomenon.

TI  - Associations of Health Literacy, Social Media Use, and Self-Efficacy With Health 
      Information-Seeking Intentions Among Social Media Users in China: Cross-sectional 
      Survey.
PG  - e19134
LID - 10.2196/19134 [doi]
LID - e19134
AB  - BACKGROUND: Empirical research has demonstrated that people frequently use social 
      media for gathering and sharing online health information. Health literacy, social 
      media use, and self-efficacy are important factors that may influence people's 
      health behaviors online. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the associations between 
      health literacy, health-related social media use, self-efficacy, and health 
      behavioral intentions online. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 
      adults 18 years and older (n=449) to examine predictors of health-related behavioral 
      intentions online including health literacy, social media use, and self-efficacy in 
      China using 2 moderated mediation models. Mediation and moderation analyses were 
      conducted. RESULTS: Self-efficacy mediated the effects of health literacy 
      (B(indirect)=0.213, 95% CI 0.101 to 0.339) and social media use (B(indirect)=0.023, 
      95% CI 0.008 to 0.045) on health behavioral intentions on social media. Age 
      moderated the effects of health literacy on self-efficacy (P=.03), while previous 
      experience moderated the effects of social media use on self-efficacy (P<.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Health literacy and health-related social media use influenced health 
      behavioral intentions on social media via their prior effects on self-efficacy. The 
      association between health literacy and self-efficacy was stronger among younger 
      respondents, whereas the association between health-related social media use and 
      self-efficacy was stronger among those who previously had positive experiences with 
      health information on social media. Health practitioners should target self-efficacy 
      among older populations and increase positive media experience related to health.

TI  - Updating Health Literacy for Healthy People 2030: Defining Its Importance for a New 
      Decade in Public Health.
PG  - S258-S264
LID - 10.1097/PHH.0000000000001324 [doi]
AB  - CONTENT: Healthy People 2030, the fifth iteration of the Healthy People initiative, 
      provides science-based national health objectives with targets to improve the health 
      and well-being of Americans. For the first time since its 1979 establishment, the 
      Healthy People framework aims to attain health literacy as an overarching goal and 
      foundational principle to achieving health and well-being. Growing literature on 
      health literacy describes it as a concept not solely reliant on individual 
      capabilities but also on organizations' ability to make health-related information 
      and services equitably accessible and comprehensible. PROGRAM: The US Department of 
      Health and Human Services (HHS) updates the Healthy People objectives each decade 
      based on the most current science. For the development of Healthy People 2030, HHS 
      drew on recommendations from the Secretary's Advisory Committee on National Health 
      Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives for 2030 (Secretary's Advisory 
      Committee), an independent advisory committee of national health experts, to update 
      the 20-year old individual-focused Healthy People definition of health literacy. HHS 
      solicited input from members of the public and users on the proposed changes to that 
      definition. IMPLEMENTATION: HHS published a Federal Register notice to solicit 
      public comments, which were qualitatively analyzed by government staff. EVALUATION: 
      The 2 separate analyses revealed plurality support for improving the definition to 
      focus on both individual and organizational roles in health literacy. Results led 
      HHS subject matter experts to update the definition to include definitions of 
      personal health literacy and organizational health literacy. Healthy People 2030's 
      expanded health literacy definition reflects the most current science and input from 
      the Secretary's Advisory Committee, public comments, and HHS subject matter experts. 
      DISCUSSION: The updated definition is intended to advance Healthy People 2030's 
      health literacy goals particularly as more organizations in public health and other 
      sectors acknowledge their role in the delivery of quality health information and 
      services.

LID - 8111
AB  - (1) Background: The health behavior (HB) of adolescents develops in the school or 
      family setting and plays an important role in their future health status. Health 
      literacy (HL) has been identified as an important factor in modifying health 
      behavior in addition to socioeconomic factors. health-promoting school (HPS) 
      programs also have a significant role in providing students with the means of 
      learning the importance of knowledge, behavior, and skills for a healthy lifestyle. 
      (2) Method: This study aims to identify the association between HB, HL measured in 
      comprehensive health literacy (CHL) and functional health literacy (FHL), HPS 
      programs, and socioeconomic factors among high school students in Surabaya, 
      Indonesia. A cross-sectional study was conducted, and 1066 students were evaluated 
      as respondents. (3) Result: The results of multivariate analyses showed that 
      following factors were associated with better health behavior: female, better 
      academic performance, higher grade, higher father's education, lower allowance, and 
      better CHL and FHL. The strongest association for HB was gender. CHL was especially 
      associated with handwashing, physical activity, and drug abuse. FHL was associated 
      with smoking and drug abuse. The implementation of HPS programs did not reach an 
      optimum level and only influenced physical activity. (4) Conclusions: The findings 
      confirm that CHL and FHL have a significant association with several HBs. HB 
      intervention in the HPS program is recommended to incorporate the CHL and FHL for a 
      better health impact.

TI  - Strengthening Critical Health Literacy for Health Information Appraisal: An Approach 
      from Argumentation Theory.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18136764 [doi]
LID - 6764
AB  - The overload of health information has been a major challenge during the COVID-19 
      pandemic. Public health authorities play a primary role in managing this 
      information. However, individuals have to apply critical health literacy to evaluate 
      it. The objective of this paper is to identify targets for strengthening critical 
      health literacy by focusing on the field of argumentation theory. This paper is 
      based on the textual analysis of instances of health information through the lens of 
      argumentation theory. The results show that critical health literacy benefits from: 
      (1) understanding the concept of argument and the supporting reasons, (2) 
      identifying the main argument schemes, and (3) the knowledge and use of the main 
      critical questions to check the soundness of arguments. This study operationalizes 
      the main aspects of critical health literacy. It calls for specific educational and 
      training initiatives in the field. Moreover, it argues in favor of broadening the 
      current educational curricula to empower individuals to engage in informed and 
      quality decision making. Strengthening individuals' critical health literacy 
      involves interventions to empower in argument evaluation. For this purpose, 
      argumentation theory has analytical and normative frameworks that can be adapted 
      within a lay-audience education concept.

TI  - Impact of language preference and health literacy on health information-seeking 
      experiences among a low-income, multilingual cohort.
LID - S0738-3991(21)00574-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.pec.2021.08.028 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the impact of language preference and health literacy on 
      health information-seeking experiences in a multilingual, low-income cohort. 
      METHODS: We administered a modified Health Information National Trends Survey in 
      English, Spanish, and Chinese to a sample of San Francisco city/county residents. 
      Using multivariable logistic regression analyses, we assessed how language and 
      health literacy impact health information-seeking experiences (confidence, effort, 
      frustration, quality concerns, and difficulty understanding information), adjusting 
      for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, usual place of care, health status, 
      information-seeking behaviors, and smartphone ownership. RESULTS: Of 1000 
      participants (487 English-speaking, 256 Spanish-speaking, 257 Chinese-speaking), 820 
      (82%) reported at least one negative health information-seeking experience. 
      Chinese-language was associated with frustration (aOR = 2.56; 1.12-5.86). Difficulty 
      understanding information was more likely in Spanish-language respondents 
      (aOR = 3.58; 1.25-10.24). Participants with limited health literacy reported more 
      effort (aOR = 1.97; 1.22-3.17), frustration (aOR = 2.09; 1.28-3.43), concern about 
      quality (aOR = 2.72; 1.60-4.61), and difficulty understanding information 
      (aOR = 2.53; 1.58-4.05). Language and literacy impacted confidence only in the 
      interaction term between Chinese-speakers and health literacy. CONCLUSION: We found 
      that negative health information-seeking experiences were common in non-English 
      speaking populations those with limited health literacy. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: 
      Health communication efforts should consider both language preference and health 
      literacy to ensure accessibility for all patients.

TI  - Health Literacy in Multiple Sclerosis patients: A Concept Analysis Using the 
      Evolutionary Method.
PG  - 49-56
LID - 10.34172/jcs.2021.010 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Health literacy is one of the effective factors in health promotion of 
      chronic patients. However, little attention has been paid to it; no exact and clear 
      definition of health literacy has ever been accessible in chronic diseases. This 
      study was conducted with aim of defining and clarifying attributes, antecedents, and 
      consequences of health literacy in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Methods: 
      Rodgers' evolutionary method of concept analysis was used to clarify the concept of 
      health literacy in MS patients. A literature review was conducted with key terms 
      "multiple sclerosis", "health literacy", "information literacy", "functional 
      health", "health education", "health promotion" and "health behavior". Eight hundred 
      and sixty papers for the period 1980- 2019 were found and finally 23 articles and 
      texts were selected for the analysis. Data analysis was carried out using a thematic 
      analysis. Results: Health literacy in MS patients is a multidimensional concept with 
      forth attributes: health information evaluation, understand disease and its related 
      issues, reading skills and capacity to use knowledge. Ability to read and 
      comprehend, interacting with health personnel, and interacting with peers as an 
      antecedents and improved self-care, health promotion, medication adherence, and 
      decreased use of health care services to be the consequences of these attributes 
      were found. Conclusion: The findings can add knowledge about the concept of health 
      literacy in MS patients. Also, health care professionals can use a deeper 
      understanding of the concept of health literacy in providing care plan for MS 
      patients.

TI  - The Relationship between Subtypes of Health Literacy and Self-Care Behavior in 
      Chronic Kidney Disease.
LID - 10.3390/jpm11060447 [doi]
LID - 447
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health issue that is associated with 
      high rates of morbidity and mortality. Self-care behavior has been associated with 
      clinical outcomes in chronic diseases, and adequate self-care behavior may mitigate 
      adverse outcomes. Health literacy may be an important factor associated with 
      self-care. The aim of this study was to examine the relationships between different 
      domains of self-care behavior and health literacy in patients with CKD. This study 
      enrolled 208 patients with CKD stages 1-5 who were not undergoing renal replacement 
      therapy at Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital from April 2019 to January 2020. 
      Health literacy was measured using a multidimensional health literacy questionnaire 
      covering the following five dimensions: accessing, understanding, appraising, and 
      applying health information, and communication/interaction. The CKD Self-Care scale, 
      which is a 16-item questionnaire with five domains including medication adherence, 
      diet control, exercise, smoking behavior, and home blood pressure monitoring was 
      used to assess self-care behavior. Among the 208 patients, 97 had sufficient or 
      excellent health literacy, and 111 had inadequate or limited/problematic health 
      literacy. A higher health literacy score was significantly correlated with greater 
      self-care behavior. Among the five domains of self-care behavior, the patients who 
      had sufficient or excellent health literacy had higher diet, exercise, and home 
      blood pressure monitoring scores than those who had inadequate or 
      limited/problematic health literacy. This study demonstrated that health literacy 
      was significantly and positively correlated with self-care behavior in patients with 
      CKD.

TI  - Identification of low health and cancer literacy in oncology patients: a 
      cross-sectional survey.
PG  - 6605-6612
LID - 10.1007/s00520-021-06164-2 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Health literacy is a significant public health concern, particularly 
      given the increased complexity of chronic disease health management and health 
      system navigation, and documented associations between low health literacy and poor 
      health outcomes. This study therefore aimed to identify the proportion and 
      characteristics of outpatients visiting a specialist cancer hospital who report low 
      health literacy and/or low cancer health literacy. METHOD: This study used a 
      cross-sectional survey administered verbally with patients attending a specialist 
      cancer hospital located in Melbourne, Australia over a two-week period. Process data 
      on conducting health literacy screening within a clinical setting was collected. 
      RESULTS: Those identified with inadequate general health literacy were different to 
      those identified with low cancer-specific health literacy, although overall both 
      proportions were low. Cross-sectional screening of patients was difficult, despite 
      utilising verbal surveying methods designed to increase capacity for participation. 
      CONCLUSION: Health literacy screening using the tools selected was not useful for 
      identifying or describing patients with low health literacy in this setting, given 
      the disparity in those categorised by each measure. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Until the 
      theoretical construct of health literacy is better defined, measurement of health 
      literacy may not be clinically useful.

TI  - Health Literacy Levels and Predictors Among Lebanese Adults Visiting Outpatient 
      Clinics in Beirut.
PG  - e295-e309
LID - 10.3928/24748307-20211012-02 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To date, there has been a dearth of research on health literacy in the 
      Eastern Mediterranean Region and in particular Lebanon. OBJECTIVES: This 
      cross-sectional study assessed the levels and correlates of health literacy in 
      Lebanese adults. METHODS: A total of 587 participants (54.5% women) were recruited 
      from the outpatient clinics of five health facilities in Beirut. The questionnaire 
      consisted of the Arabic version of the Functional Health literacy Scale, the Arabic 
      short version of the European Health Literacy Survey, and questions on 
      sociodemographic and health-related factors. Descriptive and inferential statistics 
      were performed to assess the association of these factors with functional health 
      literacy (FHL) and comprehensive health literacy (CHL) levels. KEY RESULTS: About 
      65.8% had inadequate or problematic FHL and 43.8% had inadequate or problematic CHL. 
      Although FHL was negatively correlated with long-term illness, it was positively 
      correlated with ability to pay and health status. CHL was positively correlated with 
      education, income, ability to pay for treatment, health status, and FHL level, 
      whereas it was negatively correlated with long-term illness. Binary logistic 
      regression showed that low education, low socioeconomic status, and being a widow 
      were predictive of inadequate FHL. Moreover, having inadequate FHL and low income 
      increased the likelihood of having inadequate CHL. CONCLUSION: This study has 
      identified those with risk factors for inadequate health literacy and unfavorable 
      health outcomes. A national action plan can guide the promotion of health literacy 
      and its embeddedness in society to instill competencies and the environment that 
      would eliminate health inequities and sustain health in Lebanon. [HLRP: Health 
      Literacy Research and Practice. 2021;5(4):e295-e309.] Plain Language Summary: This 
      study examined health literacy levels and correlates in 587 Lebanese adults using 
      two recognized screening tools. The first tool measured functional health literacy 
      (FHL), which represents the ability of a person to acquire information on health 
      through reading or writing. The second tool assessed comprehensive health literacy 
      (CHL), which encompasses the ability of a person to use their social skills to 
      acquire health information from different media and make appropriate health 
      decisions based on this information. Close to two-thirds of the participants had 
      inadequate or problematic FHL. More specifically, low education, low socioeconomic 
      status, and widowhood were predictive of inadequate FHL. Nearly one-half of the 
      participants had inadequate or problematic CHL with an increased likelihood of 
      inadequate levels in people with low FHL and low income.

TI  - Risk factors for poorer health literacy in patients with liver cirrhosis.
PG  - e0255349
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0255349 [doi]
LID - e0255349
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health literacy is a concept that refers to patients' ability to manage 
      their disease and the health system's ability to guarantee access to services. There 
      is evidence that health literacy impacts the health outcomes of patients with 
      chronic diseases, but detailed information on this topic in patients with liver 
      cirrhosis is scarce. It was the aim of this study to identify risk factors for 
      poorer health literacy in patients with liver cirrhosis. METHODS: 89 patients with 
      liver cirrhosis were enrolled in this study and health literacy was measured using 
      the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ). Covert hepatic encephalopathy (CHE) was 
      diagnosed clinically according to the West-Haven Criteria (HE grade 1) and the PHES 
      (minimal HE). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating 
      Scale (HDRS). Based on the nine subscales of the HLQ, risk factors for poor health 
      literacy were identified using linear regression models. RESULTS: Normalized HLQ 
      scores ranged between 65-76%, while appraisal of health information had lowest score 
      (65%) and ability to actively engage with healthcare providers had highest score 
      (76%). Multivariable regression analyses revealed an association of poorer health 
      literacy and liver function as determined by MELD score and complications of liver 
      cirrhosis such as a history of ascites or CHE. Additionally, we identified 
      modifiable or preventable factors such as depressive symptoms, a history of falls, 
      and active smoking as risk factors for poorer health literacy. CONCLUSION: Multiple 
      factors seem to impact on health literacy in patients with liver cirrhosis. 
      Addressing modifiable and preventable factors may improve health literacy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Health literacy is a nationwide public health concern. Low health 
      literacy in adolescents is related to increased adolescent high-risk behaviors, 
      which can negatively affect their overall health. METHOD: A quality improvement 
      health literacy project was developed, implemented, and evaluated in a juvenile 
      temporary detention center. Stakeholders identified pertinent health-related topics 
      for discussion, including female body anatomy, sexual health, consent, pornography, 
      sex trafficking, smoking, and anger management. Toolkits and pretest/posttest 
      questionnaires guided weekly group sessions. Youth engaged in content during each 
      session. RESULTS: Group health literacy scores were examined to evaluate the 
      program. Group comments were debriefed by facilitators after each session; 119 youth 
      residents participated. Positive increases in health literacy and health knowledge 
      were observed in all sessions for all groups. DISCUSSION: Interactive health 
      education programs for incarcerated youth can improve their health literacy and 
      health knowledge and begin a path to decrease health inequities in this vulnerable 
      population.

TI  - Substance Use, General Health and Health Literacy as Predictors of Oral Health in 
      Emerging Adult Sexual Minority Men of Color: A Secondary Data Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18041987 [doi]
LID - 1987
AB  - There is limited evidence surrounding oral health in emerging adult, sexual minority 
      men of color. This study examined the association between sociodemographic factors, 
      health literacy, cigarette, e-cigarette, and alcohol use on oral health outcomes. 
      Secondary data analysis was conducted with 322 sexual minority men ages 18-34 in the 
      United States. Between-group, mean-level, and multivariable logistic regression 
      analyses examined differences on oral health outcomes. Increased cigarette (aOR = 
      1.84, p = 0.03), e-cigarette (aOR = 1.40, p = 0.03), and alcohol use (aOR = 2.07, p 
      = 0.05) were associated with extended time away from the dentist. Health literacy 
      (aOR = 0.93, p = 0.05) was negatively associated. Increased cigarette (aOR = 1.17, p 
      = 0.04) and cigarette use (aOR = 1.26, p = 0.04) were associated with tooth loss. 
      Health literacy was negatively associated (aOR = 0.65, p = 0.03). Increased 
      e-cigarette (aOR = 1.74, p = 0.04) and cigarette use (aOR = 4.37, p < 0.001) were 
      associated with dental affordability issues. Lower health literacy and racial 
      identification as Black were associated with dental affordability issues; 
      demonstrating an urgent need to address these factors to improve oral health in 
      emerging adult sexual minority men of color.

TI  - An Innovative Health Literacy Approach Designed to Improve Patient Understanding of 
      Medication Labeling.
PG  - 1180-1192

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Limited health literacy negatively impacts understanding of 
      medication-related information. We describe an innovative methodology designed to 
      optimize user understanding of patient medication labeling through the systematic 
      application of evidence-based health literacy principles, using the Patient Package 
      Insert (PPI) for bezlotoxumab (ZINPLAVA™, Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA) as 
      an example. METHODS: We used a mixed-model, iterative approach consisting of three 
      phases: (1) content development; (2) focus group testing; and (3) comprehension 
      testing. Content development was based on evidence-based health literacy principles 
      and conducted through a collaborative partnership between industry and academia 
      professionals. The PPI was then tested in four focus groups, two in Atlanta and two 
      in Chicago, with an emphasis on collecting feedback from respondents with limited 
      health literacy, evaluated using the Newest Vital Sign (NVS) health literacy 
      assessment tool. Subsequent comprehension testing included patients with C. diff, 
      caregivers, and general population members, with a pre-defined target sample of 25% 
      with limited health literacy identified through two health literacy assessment 
      tools: the Single Item Literacy Screener and the NVS. RESULTS: Content development 
      of the bezlotoxumab PPI occurred in May 2015. In June 2015, focus group respondents 
      (n = 34) provided generally favorable feedback, with insights revolving around 
      organization and usability; language and comprehension; and volume of information. 
      Comprehension testing of the revised PPI resulted in average comprehension scores of 
      96% for the overall population (n = 59), 90% for individuals presenting with limited 
      health literacy (n = 14), and 97% for those with adequate health literacy (n = 45). 
      This PPI development approach was similarly effective for subsequent products across 
      diverse therapeutic areas, with comprehension scores ≥ 86% for all participants 
      (n = 1197). CONCLUSION: This methodology represents a significant advancement for 
      the development of understandable patient medication labeling, especially for people 
      with limited health literacy.

AB  - Mental health disorders account for a heavy disease burden in Uganda. In order to 
      provide culturally appropriate mental health prevention and treatment approaches, it 
      is necessary to understand how mental health is conceptualized in the population. 
      Three focus group discussions (FGDs) and 31 in-depth interviews (IDIs) were 
      conducted with men and women aged 14 to 62 years residing in rural, urban, and 
      semi-urban low-income communities in central and western Uganda to explore 
      perceptions and knowledge of mental health. Interpretive thematic analysis was 
      undertaken; results were organized through the lens of the mental health literacy 
      framework. Environmental and societal stressors were identified as primary 
      underlying causes of poor mental health. While participants recognized symptoms of 
      poor mental health, gaps in mental health literacy also emerged. Mental health 
      resources are needed in this setting and additional qualitative work assessing 
      knowledge and attitudes toward mental health care seeking behavior can inform the 
      development of acceptable integrated services.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Health literacy is a fundamental contributor to an individual's ability 
      to self-manage their health and appropriately use health care services. Tools that 
      positively impact health literacy therefore have potential to improve health 
      outcomes. Inpatient portals are a tool that provides patients an opportunity to 
      cultivate health literacy skills during hospitalization. Our study investigated how 
      inpatient portal use could impact attributes of health literacy. METHODS: We 
      conducted semi-structured interviews with 132 patients and 440 care team members to 
      learn about patients' inpatient portal use. Interview transcripts were analyzed 
      deductively and inductively to categorize data and understand emergent themes around 
      health literacy. RESULTS: Patients and care team members identified inpatient portal 
      functions that they perceived to positively impact health literacy. These functions 
      included providing patients access to health information, care plans, and 
      educational materials, as well as enabling patient communication with their care 
      team. CONCLUSION: Recognizing the potential of inpatient portals to improve health 
      literacy is critical to ensure they are implemented in ways that leverage this 
      benefit for patients. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Health care organizations should 
      implement inpatient portals that include features that support health literacy and 
      encourage patients to use these portals in ways that improve their health literacy 
      skills.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Inadequate financial and health literacy presents a formidable public 
      health and economic challenge in old age. This study investigated declining 
      financial and health literacy in relation to decision making performance, scam 
      susceptibility and psychological wellbeing. DESIGN: Longitudinal study. SETTING: A 
      community-based cohort in Northeastern Illinois, USA. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand 
      fourty-six older adults who were free of dementia at baseline and underwent annual 
      clinical and literacy assessments. MEASUREMENTS: Financial and health literacy, 
      decision making, scam susceptibility, and psychological wellbeing were assessed 
      using validated instruments. Linear mixed effects models estimated person-specific 
      rates of change in financial and health literacy, and multivariable regression 
      analyses examined the associations of declining literacy with subsequent levels of 
      decision making, scam susceptibility, and psychological wellbeing. RESULTS: The mean 
      age was 81 years and 76% were female. Over up to 10 years of annual follow-ups, the 
      average financial and health literacy score dropped 1 percentage point a year. 
      Substantial variability in decline was observed between participants. Faster decline 
      in financial and health literacy was associated with poorer decision making, higher 
      scam susceptibility, and lower psychological wellbeing. Notably, these associations 
      were above and beyond the baseline literacy level and persisted even after 
      controlling for cognition. CONCLUSIONS: Most community-dwelling older adults 
      experience decline in financial and health literacy over time, but decline is not 
      inevitable. Declining literacy is related to poorer decision making, greater scam 
      susceptibility and lower wellbeing. These findings suggest that efforts to mitigate 
      declining financial and health literacy may promote independence and wellbeing in 
      old age.

TI  - A Strategy for Teaching Health Literacy to Physician Assistant Students.
PG  - e70-e77
LID - 10.3928/24748307-20210201-01 [doi]
AB  - This brief report presents a model that incorporates an analogous "see-one," 
      "do-one," "teach-one" pedagogical strategy and experiential learning for mastery of 
      health literacy principles by first-year Master of Science in Physician Assistant 
      Studies students. Students completed a series of health literacy activities 
      including classroom-based lecture (see-one), hands-on application of health literacy 
      activities (do-one), and application and peer-instruction of health literacy best 
      practices with other health science students (teach-one) as part of a two-semester 
      hands-on learning experience. A health literacy knowledge examination, qualitative 
      student feedback, and faculty review of content application were used to assess for 
      effectiveness. Students demonstrated a significant and sustained positive change in 
      knowledge examination scores complemented by positive faculty poster review. 
      Physician Assistant student health literacy knowledge is increased and sustained 
      after application of see-one, do-one, teach-one strategy with students demonstrating 
      health literacy considerations in real-client application during experiential 
      learning. Education programs seeking to meet the call for health professionals 
      prepared to address gaps in health literacy should consider a see-one, do-one, 
      teach-one and experiential learning approach over multiple semesters. [HLRP: Health 
      Literacy Research and Practice. 2021;5(1):e70-e77.].

TI  - Multimorbidity and health literacy: A population-based survey among 28,627 Danish 
      adults.

LID - 10.1177/14034948211045921 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Individuals with multimorbidity often have complex healthcare needs challenging 
      their health literacy skills. This study aimed to investigate the association 
      between the number of physical conditions and health literacy and to examine the 
      difference in health literacy levels between individuals with multimorbidity based 
      on physical conditions and individuals with additional mental disorders. METHODS: 
      Respondents aged 25 years or older from a Danish population-based survey were 
      included (N = 28,627). Multimorbidity was assessed based on 18 self-reported chronic 
      conditions; health literacy was measured using two scales from the Health Literacy 
      Questionnaire focusing on understanding health information and engaging with 
      healthcare providers. Associations were examined using multiple logistic regression 
      analysis. RESULTS: We found a positive association between number of physical 
      conditions and the odds of having difficulties in understanding health information 
      and engaging with healthcare providers. For example, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 
      having difficulties in understanding health information was 1.45 (95% confidence 
      interval (CI): 1.09-1.94) for individuals with two physical conditions compared with 
      individuals without multimorbidity. The associations formed a positive 
      exposure-response pattern. Furthermore, respondents with both mental and physical 
      conditions had more than twice the odds of having health literacy difficulties 
      compared to respondents with only physical conditions (adjusted OR 2.53 (95% CI 
      2.02-3.18) and 2.28 (95% CI 1.92-2.72) for the scales, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our results suggest that responding to patients' health literacy needs is crucial 
      for individuals with multimorbidity - especially those with combined mental and 
      physical conditions.

TI  - Validation of the Persian version of the mental health literacy scale in Iran.
PG  - e12447
LID - 10.1111/appy.12447 [doi]
AB  - The present study was designed to validate an English version of the mental health 
      literacy scale into Persian, in Iran. Statistical population consisted of all 
      residents of 22 municipal districts of Tehran, Iran, in 2018. Multistage sampling 
      methods were used (sample size = 1026). All participants filled the Mental Health 
      Literacy scale; 12-item General Health Questionnaire; Multidimensional Health Locus 
      of Control scale and a demographic checklist. Exploratory and confirmatory factor 
      analysis, the intra-class correlation coefficient was used for analysing data. All 
      analyses were run with SPSS and AMOS Graphics version 18. Exploratory factor 
      analysis revealed five components (24 items) explaining 21.68%, 20.24%, 8.97%, 6.48% 
      and 5.36% of the variance respectively (totally explained variance = 62.74%). 
      Confirmatory factor analysis showed an acceptable goodness-of-fit (CMIN/DF = 3.19, 
      GFI = 0.887, CFI = 0.893, IFI = 0.894, TLI = 0.877, RMSEA = 0.065). The values of 
      Cronbach's alpha showed satisfactory internal consistency. Two clinical correlates 
      of mental health literacy were investigated. The structure of the mental health 
      literacy scale was to some extent different from the one in O'Connor et al. study, 
      but it was consistent with the definition of MHL presented by Jorm et al. This is 
      the first Persian version of the MHL in the general population in Iran and 
      undoubtedly needs to be checked on more studies.

TI  - A new comprehensive oral health literacy scale: development and psychometric 
      evaluation.
PG  - 429
LID - 10.1186/s12903-021-01795-7 [doi]
LID - 429
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been widely accepted that oral health status is related to oral 
      health literacy. The need to measure oral health literacy has led to the development 
      of measurement instruments. This study aimed to develop a comprehensive instrument 
      for adults and to examine its reliability and validity in China. METHODS: A 
      three-step design process was used. First, a literature review and expert panel 
      discussion were used to draw up a 37-item pool covering oral health knowledge, 
      belief, practice, skill, and functional oral health literacy. The Delphi method was 
      used to delete and modify questions in the item pool. The draft instrument was 
      evaluated by nine experts and the consensus among them was calculated using the 
      content validity index. The scale was then used to conduct a psychometric study 
      among 370 participants from community health centers in Beijing. Construct validity, 
      discriminant validity and concurrent validity were examined. The Cronbach's alpha 
      coefficient, and test-retest methods were used to assess reliability. RESULTS: The 
      final scale included 30 items across four dimensions. The item-level content 
      validity index was 0.90. Exploratory factor analysis extracted four fixed factors, 
      and the result of the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin and Bartlett's tests was 0.752, with the 
      model explaining 35.21% of the total variance. The four dimensions were associated 
      with oral health knowledge, perceptions of oral health issues, oral health practice 
      and skills, and functional oral health literacy. The mean score of the lowest 27% 
      was significantly lower than the highest 27% (P < 0.01), suggesting adequate 
      discriminant validity. The associations between comprehensive oral health literacy 
      scores and educational level, income and self-reported literacy level were 
      significant (P < 0.001), showing adequate overall concurrent validity. Internal 
      consistency and test-retest reliability were acceptable, with a Cronbach's alpha of 
      0.72 and a total test-retest reliability coefficient of 0.979. CONCLUSIONS: Initial 
      testing of the comprehensive oral health literacy instrument suggested that it is a 
      valid and reliable instrument to evaluate individuals' oral health literacy, with 
      four dimensions for evaluating knowledge, belief, skills, and functional oral health 
      literacy.

AB  - This study explores the mediating role of health literacy on the association between 
      health care system distrust and vaccine hesitancy. An online survey including 
      Personal Information Form, Health Care System Distrust Scale, Vaccine Hesitancy 
      Scale, and Health Literacy Scale were applied to 620 participants. The degree of 
      applying mask-wearing, hygiene rule and physical distance, and the level of COVID-19 
      vaccine literacy were modeled with hierarchical multiple regression analysis to have 
      a deeper analysis of participants' actions towards COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. It 
      was found that health care system distrust and health literacy were the most 
      important variables that had an impact on vaccine hesitancy. Based on the mediation 
      analysis, the total effect of health care system distrust on vaccine hesitancy was 
      statistically significant. Participants who held a low level of health literacy and 
      a high perception of the health care system distrust experienced more vaccine 
      hesitancy. The findings suggested the health literacy mediated the relationship 
      between health care system distrust and vaccine hesitancy. Health authorities need 
      to consider the dynamic and complex factors around the health care system distrust 
      and health literacy to reduce vaccine hesitancy during COVID-19.

PG  - e0259815
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0259815 [doi]
LID - e0259815
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients diagnosed with cancer face many challenges and need a good 
      understanding of their diagnosis and proposed treatments to make informed decisions 
      about their care. Health literacy plays an important role in this and low health 
      literacy has been associated with poorer outcomes. The aims of this review are to 
      identify which outcomes relate to health literacy in patients with cancer, and to 
      combine this through a mixed studies approach with the patient experience as 
      described through qualitative studies. METHODS: Four electronic databases were 
      searched in January 2021 to identify records relating to health literacy and 
      patients with cancer. Records were independently screened then assessed for 
      inclusion by two reviewers according to the following criteria: patients aged ≥18 
      years with cancer, English language publication AND health literacy measured with 
      validated tool and measured outcome associated with health literacy OR qualitative 
      study exploring the role of health literacy as patients make decisions about health. 
      Quality was independently assessed by two reviewers. A narrative synthesis was 
      performed, and findings integrated through concept mapping. This systematic review 
      was registered with PROSPERO, entry CRD42020166454. RESULTS: 4441 records were 
      retrieved. Following de-duplication, 2496 titles and abstracts were screened and 
      full texts of 405 papers were reviewed for eligibility. 66 papers relating to 60 
      studies met the eligibility criteria. Lower health literacy was associated with 
      greater difficulties understanding and processing cancer related information, poorer 
      quality of life and poorer experience of care. Personal and situational influences 
      contributed to how participants processed information and reached decisions about 
      their care. CONCLUSION: This review highlights the important role of health literacy 
      for patients with cancer. Outcomes are poorer for those who experience difficulties 
      with health literacy. Further efforts should be made to facilitate understanding, 
      develop health literacy and support patients to become more involved in their care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assessed functional health literacy and associated factors 
      among adult patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in Ethiopia. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional study was conducted on 410 respondents from May 1 to July 1, 2020, 
      using a functional health literacy questionnaire consisting of 14 items that covers 
      three conceptually distinct functional health literacy domains: having sufficient 
      information to manage my health, ability to find good health information and 
      understand health information well enough to know what to do. Data were analyzed 
      using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 23. Data were 
      collected by exit face-to-face interview using an interviewer administered and 
      pre-tested questionnaire. Statistical significance of associated variables had been 
      declared based on the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with its 95% CI and p-value <0.05. 
      RESULTS: Adequate functional health literacy was determined in 55.4% of CVD patients 
      understanding health information whereas inadequate functional health literacy was 
      determined in 53.9% participants for finding health information and in 50.5% of them 
      having sufficient information to manage my health. Educational status was found to 
      have a statistically significant association across the three domains. CONCLUSION: 
      The functional health literacy level of CVD patients varied by domain. Educational 
      status of the participant is significantly associated with the three domains of 
      functional health literacy whereas household monthly income and number of 
      information sources are significantly associated with having sufficient information 
      and the ability to find good health information. The findings indicate the need to 
      streamline medical communication that improves the functional health literacy of CVD 
      patients.
