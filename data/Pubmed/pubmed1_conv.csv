BOTH HEALTH LITERACY (R=0.40) AND NUMBER OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS (R=-0.21) CORRELATED WITH THE ACTIVE AGING SCORE. LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS REVEALED THAT HEALTH LITERACY WAS A STRONGER PREDICTOR THAN CHRONIC CONDITIONS OF ACTIVE AGING ( 0.18, P<0.001 VS. -0.06, P=0.030) AND THAT ITS PREDICTIVE VALUE REMAINED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AFTER ADJUSTMENT FOR COGNITIVE CAPACITY, NUMBER OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE AND LENGTH OF EDUCATION. HIGHER HEALTH LITERACY CAN ENABLE OLDER PERSONS, INCLUDING THOSE WITH MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS, TO MAINTAIN HIGHER LEVELS OF ACTIVE AGING. AS MORE PEOPLE ARE PROJECTED TO LIVE WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS TO OLDER AGES, HEALTH LITERACY MAY HELP THEM TO COPE WITH ILLNESSES AND FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS AND LEAD A FULFILLING LIFE.

THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND DEGREE OF HEARING LOSS AT INITIAL PRESENTATION WAS EXAMINED USING LINEAR REGRESSION, ADJUSTED FOR AGE, GENDER, MARITAL STATUS, EDUCATION LEVEL, RACE, LANGUAGE, EMPLOYMENT STATUS, AND INSURANCE COVERAGE. THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND HEARING AID ADOPTION WAS EXAMINED IN THE SUBSET OF PATIENTS IDENTIFIED AS HEARING AID CANDIDATES USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION, ADJUSTED FOR DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS AND INSURANCE COVERAGE. RESULTS: PATIENTS WITH INADEQUATE HEALTH LITERACY WERE MORE LIKELY TO PRESENT WITH MORE SEVERE HEARING LOSS (ADJUSTED MEAN PURE-TONE AVERAGE [PTA] DIFFERENCE, 5.38DB, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] 2.75 TO 8.01).

OUR GOAL WAS TO MEASURE THE HEALTH LITERACY RATES IN THE CAREGIVERS OF OUR PEDIATRIC TRACHEOSTOMY POPULATION. THESE CAREGIVERS SPECIFICALLY HAVE AN IMMENSE RESPONSIBILITY THAT REQUIRES A CERTAIN CAPACITY FOR UNDERSTANDING AND LEARNING COMPLEX SKILLS. THUS FAR THERE HAVE BEEN NO STUDIES OR SURVEYS INVESTIGATING THE RATES OF HEALTH LITERACY IN THIS POPULATION OR TRACHEOSTOMY PATIENTS IN GENERAL. CAREGIVERS' LITERACY RATES WERE MEASURED BY ADMINISTERING A TEST OF FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY IN ADULTS (TOFHLA). THIS TEST USES ACTUAL MATERIALS THAT PATIENTS MIGHT ENCOUNTER IN A TYPICAL CLINIC AND CONSISTS OF A READING COMPREHENSION AND NUMERACY SECTION. TO ASSESS IMPACT OF THE COMPLEX CARE ON CAREGIVER QUALITY OF LIFE, WE SIMULTANEOUSLY ADMINISTERED THE PEDIATRIC TRACHEOSTOMY HEALTH STATUS INSTRUMENT (PTHSI), A VALIDATED CAREGIVER QUALITY OF LIFE MEASUREMENT. METHODS: CAREGIVERS OF CHILDREN WITH TRACHEOSTOMIES WERE RECRUITED AND SURVEYED DURING THE PEDIATRIC TRACHEOSTOMY CLINIC BETWEEN JULY 2019-OCTOBER 2019. TWENTY - SIX CAREGIVERS COMPLETED THE TOFHLA; 24 COMPLETED ALL THREE PARTS - THE TOFHLA, THE DEMOGRAPHIC SURVEY, AND THE PTHSI. RESULTS: HEALTH LITERACY RATES AMONG PATIENT FAMILIES IN THE OUT-PATIENT SETTING WITH EXPERIENCE WITH TRACHEOSTOMY WERE DEEMED \"ADEQUATE\" IN 85% OF CAREGIVERS; THE REMAINING 15% OF CAREGIVERS SCORED \"INADEQUATE\". OVERALL ADULT LITERACY RATES IN THE GENERAL POPULATION IN THIS STATE ARE 26% \"INADEQUATE.\" APPROXIMATELY 80% OF OUR CAREGIVERS RELY SOLELY ON MEDICAID FOR HEALTHCARE INSURANCE AND NEARLY HALF OF PARTICIPANTS REPORTED AN ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME LESS THAN $5000. AGES OF CAREGIVERS RANGED FROM 20 TO 61 YEARS, WITH NO SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION TO HEALTH LITERACY. THE AVERAGE PTHSI SCORE WAS 36 (SD 8.6), DENOTING A MODERATE LEVEL OF CAREGIVER BURDEN BUT NO CORRELATION TO THE CAREGIVER HEALTH LITERACY SCORE WAS FOUND. WHEN COMPARING CAREGIVER HEALTH LITERACY SCORES IN RELATION TO EDUCATION LEVEL, CAREGIVERS WITH COLLEGE AND POST-GRADUATE EDUCATION HAD HIGHER LITERACY SCORES THAN THOSE WITH A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION, P=.0086. IN ADDITION, WHEN COMPARING AFRICAN AMERICAN TO WHITE CAREGIVERS, WHITE CAREGIVERS WERE FOUND TO HAVE HIGHER HEALTH LITERACY SCORES, P=.036. NOTABLY, CAREGIVER BURDEN AS MEASURED BY THE PTHSI SCORE DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN CAREGIVERS IN LOWER INCOME AND HIGHER INCOME LEVELS, P=.91. CONCLUSION: HEALTH LITERACY MEASUREMENTS FOR CAREGIVERS OF CHILDREN WITH COMPLEX MEDICAL CONDITIONS EXCEED THE HEALTH LITERACY RATES OF THE GENERAL POPULATION IN OUR STATE, POTENTIALLY BIASED BY THE INTENSIVE TRAINING PROVIDED TO FAMILIES DURING THEIR PROLONGED HOSPITALIZATION.

ALTHOUGH HEALTH LITERACY RESEARCH IN CHINA HAS GAINED INCREASING ATTENTION IN RECENT YEARS, MOST EXISTING STUDIES FOCUS ON ADULTS RATHER THAN ADOLESCENTS. IN ADDITION, LITTLE THEORY-DRIVEN EMPIRICAL RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP AMONG HEALTH LITERACY, ITS INFLUENCING FACTORS, AND HEALTH OUTCOMES SCORED ON A SKILLS-BASED HEALTH LITERACY INSTRUMENT. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY APPLIED MANGANELLO'S FRAMEWORK TO INVESTIGATE HOW HEALTH LITERACY WAS RELATED TO ITS ANTECEDENTS AND HEALTH STATUS IN SECONDARY STUDENTS IN BEIJING, CHINA. METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED WITH 650 STUDENTS IN YEARS 7 TO 9 (AGE 11-17 YEARS) FROM FOUR SECONDARY SCHOOLS. STUDENTS COMPLETED A SELF-ADMINISTERED QUESTIONNAIRE BASED ON MANGANELLO'S HEALTH LITERACY FRAMEWORK, WHICH MEASURED KEY UPSTREAM DETERMINANTS, INCLUDING HEALTH LITERACY AND SELF-REPORT HEALTH STATUS. HEALTH LITERACY WAS MEASURED ON AN 8-ITEM SKILLS-BASED INSTRUMENT THAT ASSESSES A PERSON'S ABILITY TO FIND, UNDERSTAND, APPRAISE, AND COMMUNICATE HEALTH INFORMATION IN EVERYDAY LIFE (SCORES RANGE FROM 0-37). DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND PATH ANALYSIS WERE CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE THE MEDIATING ROLE OF HEALTH LITERACY IN PREDICTING HEALTH STATUS. KEY RESULTS: OVERALL, THE AVERAGE SCORES OF STUDENTS' HEALTH LITERACY WAS 26.37 (5.89). MANGANELLO'S FRAMEWORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE DATA COLLECTED ((2)/DF = 2.049, P = .001, COMPARATIVE FIX INDEX = 0.966, ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR OF APPROXIMATION = 0.041). PERSONAL SELF-EFFICACY (R = 0.11, P = .007), SOCIAL SUPPORT (R = 0.18, P < .001), AND SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT (R = 0.27, P < .001) PREDICTED HEALTH LITERACY, WHICH IN TURN PREDICTED STUDENTS' HEALTH STATUS (R = 0.12, P = .005). CONCLUSIONS: ADOLESCENT HEALTH LITERACY IS NOT ONLY A PERSON'S CAPABILITY TO PROTECT HEALTH, BUT ALSO AN INTERACTIVE OUTCOME WITH THE BROADER ENVIRONMENT. PROMOTING HEALTH LITERACY COULD BE A USEFUL STRATEGY TO IMPROVE HEALTH STATUS FOR ADOLESCENTS; HOWEVER, A HOLISTIC APPROACH IS NEEDED TO INCREASE STUDENTS' SELF-EFFICACY, PROMOTE SOCIAL SUPPORT, AND CREATE POSITIVE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENTS TO ACHIEVE OPTIMAL HEALTH LITERACY AND HEALTH OUTCOMES.

OVERUTILIZATION OF SCREENING PROCEDURES INCONSISTENT WITH THE U.S. PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE GUIDELINES CONTRIBUTES TO THE HIGH COST OF HEALTH CARE. THE AUTHORS HYPOTHESIZE THAT HIGHER HEALTH LITERACY SUPPORTS GUIDELINE-CONCORDANT SCREENING. THIS STUDY ASSESSES THE EFFECT OF HEALTH LITERACY ON NONRECOMMENDED PROSTATE, BREAST, AND CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING IN PATIENTS OLDER THAN THE RECOMMENDED SCREENING AGE LIMIT. METHODS: THE 2016 BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM INCLUDED HEALTH LITERACY MODULES. RESPONDENTS SELF-REPORTED THEIR ABILITY TO OBTAIN AND UNDERSTAND HEALTH INFORMATION, RESULTING IN 4 HEALTH LITERACY RANKINGS. THE AUTHORS CALCULATED THE POPULATION-WEIGHTED PROPORTION OF RESPONDENTS IN EACH HEALTH LITERACY CATEGORY WHO UNDERWENT SCREENING PAST THE TASK FORCERECOMMENDED AGE LIMIT. THE ORS OF NONRECOMMENDED SCREENING FOR EACH MALIGNANCY WERE CALCULATED, WITH LOW HEALTH LITERACY AS THE REF CATEGORY. RESULTS: INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGHER HEALTH LITERACY UNDERWENT MORE NONRECOMMENDED SCREENING. NONRECOMMENDED PROSTATE CANCER SCREENING WAS PERFORMED IN 27.4% (95% CI=23.7%, 31.4%) AND 47.7% (95% CI=44.1%, 51.3%) OF RESPONDENTS WITH LOW AND HIGH HEALTH LITERACY, RESPECTIVELY (P<0.001). NONRECOMMENDED BREAST CANCER SCREENING WAS PERFORMED IN 46.8% (95% CI=42.6%, 51.1%) AND 67.7% (95% CI=64.2%, 71.1%) OF RESPONDENTS WITH LOW AND HIGH HEALTH LITERACY, RESPECTIVELY (P=0.002). NONRECOMMENDED CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING WAS PERFORMED IN 33.8% (95% CI=31.1%, 36.5%) AND 48.4% (95% CI=46.3%, 50.5%) OF RESPONDENTS WITH LOW AND HIGH HEALTH LITERACY, RESPECTIVELY (P<0.001). INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGH HEALTH LITERACY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY THAN THOSE WITH LOW HEALTH LITERACY TO SCREEN AGAINST THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PROSTATE (OR=1.73, 95% CI=1.34, 2.23, P<0.001), CERVICAL (OR=1.533, 95% CI=1.31, 1.80, P<0.001), AND BREAST (OR=8.213, 95% CI=4.90, 13.76, P<0.001) CANCER.

DESPITE POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS THERE IS LIMITED RESEARCH ASSESSING THEIR HEALTH LITERACY. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AIMS TO SYNTHESISE RESEARCH ON HEALTH LITERACY RATES, CONCEPTUALIZATIONS, AND OUTCOMES OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS, INCLUDING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. THIS WILL PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO HOW HEALTH LITERACY MIGHT BE TARGETED TO REDUCE THESE HEALTH INEQUITIES. METHODS: A SEARCH OF PUBLISHED LITERATURE IN MULTIPLE DATABASES UP UNTIL FEBRUARY 2019 WAS CONDUCTED. ONE REVIEWER SCREENED THE TITLES, ABSTRACTS AND KEYWORDS OF IDENTIFIED PUBLICATIONS AND THE ELIGIBILITY OF ALL FULL-TEXT PUBLICATIONS WERE ASSESSED FOR INCLUSION ALONG WITH A SECOND REVIEWER. BOTH REVIEWERS INDEPENDENTLY RATED THE QUALITY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES. RESULTS: FOURTEEN STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW. RATES AND MEASURES OF HEALTH LITERACY VARIED. LOW HEALTH LITERACY AND HEALTH LITERACY WEAKNESSES WERE IDENTIFIED. THERE IS A LACK OF RESEARCH ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND OTHER OUTCOMES, PARTICULARLY HEALTH SERVICE ENGAGEMENT. CONCLUSION: THE REVIEW HIGHLIGHTS THE HIGH RATES OF LOW HEALTH LITERACY WITHIN THIS POPULATION COMPARED WITH GENERAL POPULATIONS. MOST STUDIES USED A FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY MEASURE, DESPITE ITS LIMITATIONS, WITH ONLY A FEW USING MULTIDIMENSIONAL MEASURES. OVERALL, THERE IS LIMITED RESEARCH EXAMINING THE IMPACT THAT THIS POPULATIONS HEALTH LITERACY HAS ON THEIR RECOVERY AND HOW IT AFFECTS THEM OVER TIME. THE REVIEW EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF PRACTITIONERS ASSESSING AND TARGETING HEALTH LITERACY NEEDS WHEN WORKING WITH THIS POPULATION.","SCHOOL OF PSYCHOLOGY, FACULTY OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF WOLLONGONG, WOLLONGONG, AUSTRALIA.; ILLAWARRA HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE, UNIVERSITY OF WOLLONGONG, WOLLONGONG, AUSTRALIA.; SCHOOL OF PSYCHOLOGY, FACULTY OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF WOLLONGONG, WOLLONGONG, AUSTRALIA.; ILLAWARRA HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE, UNIVERSITY OF WOLLONGONG, WOLLONGONG, AUSTRALIA.; SCHOOL OF PSYCHOLOGY, FACULTY OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF WOLLONGONG, WOLLONGONG, AUSTRALIA.; ILLAWARRA HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE, UNIVERSITY OF WOLLONGONG, WOLLONGONG, AUSTRALIA.; SCHOOL OF PSYCHOLOGY, FACULTY OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF WOLLONGONG, WOLLONGONG, AUSTRALIA.; ILLAWARRA HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE, UNIVERSITY OF WOLLONGONG, WOLLONGONG, AUSTRALIA.; SCHOOL OF PSYCHOLOGY, FACULTY OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF WOLLONGONG, WOLLONGONG, AUSTRALIA.;","ORCID: 0000-0002-3552-4627 ORCID: 0000-0003-0500-1865 ORCID: 0000-0002-3409-475X ORCID: 0000-0002-6247-7416"," 2020 JOHN WILEY & SONS AUSTRALIA, LTD.",NA,NA,"2020/11/30 20:16",NA,"20201130",2021,"2020/12/01 06:00",NA,"AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESEARCH TRAINING PROGRAM (RTP) SCHOLARSHIP/","6","1751-7893 (ELECTRONIC) 1751-7885 (LINKING)","101320027","EARLY INTERVENTION IN PSYCHIATRY","ENG","10.1111/EIP.13090 [DOI]","20211108","2020/12/01 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","1454-1469","AUSTRALIA",NA,NA,"33254279","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"EARLY INTERV PSYCHIATRY. 2021 DEC;15(6):1454-1469.

METHODS: CONSUMERS, HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS, RESEARCHERS, DEVELOPERS, NONGOVERNMENT AND GOVERNMENT/POLICY STAKEHOLDERS (N=51) PARTICIPATED IN FOCUS GROUPS/INTERVIEWS DISCUSSING BARRIERS, ENABLERS, NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIGITAL HEALTH IMPLEMENTATION IN CANCER CARE. RESEARCHERS APPLIED FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY THEMES OF DIGITAL HEALTH LITERACY IN THE CONTEXT OF DISPARITY AND INCLUSION. RESULTS: LIMITED DIGITAL AND TRADITIONAL HEALTH LITERACY WERE IDENTIFIED AS BARRIERS TO DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY ENGAGEMENT, WITH A RANGE OF DIFFICULTIES IDENTIFIED FOR OLDER, YOUNGER AND SOCIO-ECONOMICALLY OR GEOGRAPHICALLY DISADVANTAGED GROUPS.

THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATION OF BOTH CONCEPTS AT A POPULATION LEVEL AND ESTIMATE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND ADHERENCE TO PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT IN ADULTS FROM 14 DISTRICTS IN DIFFERENT REGIONS IN CHILE. A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT IN 14 DISTRICTS FROM 3 DIFFERENT REGIONS OF CHILE. SAMPLING WAS CARRIED OUT BY VOLUNTEERS. THREE QUESTIONNAIRES WERE APPLIED: SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC; MORISKY-GREEN-LEVINE (MMAS-4) AND THE SHORT ASSESSMENT OF HEALTH LITERACY FOR SPANISH ADULTS TEST (SAHLSA-50). DATA WERE ANALYZED DESCRIPTIVELY, AND A MULTILEVEL POISSON REGRESSION MODEL WAS FITTED TO EVALUATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND ADHERENCE TO PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT, CONSIDERING THE DISTRICTS AS FIXED INTERCEPTS. A TOTAL OF 1,336 PERSONS WERE SURVEYED; 811 SELF-REPORTED AS HAVING AT LEAST 1 NCD. A 83.4% HAD ADEQUATE LITERACY AND 37.1% WERE ADHERENT TO PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT, REGARDLESS OF THEIR HEALTH LITERACY. A 3.6% (VARIANCE PARTITION COEFFICIENT=0.036) CORRELATION OF ADHERENCE TO TREATMENT WAS OBSERVED IN RESPONDENTS LIVING IN THE SAME DISTRICT. THOSE WITH INADEQUATE HEALTH LITERACY HAD A 12% GREATER PREVALENCE OF BEING NON-ADHERENT (PREVALENCE RATIO 1.12; IC 95% 0.87-1.47) WHEN ADJUSTING FOR INDIVIDUAL VARIABLES. THESE RESULTS COULD SUGGEST THAT THE INDIVIDUAL'S LOCAL CONTEXT DOES NOT INFLUENCE THE RELATION OF FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY AND ADHERENCE TO PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT IN POPULATIONS WITH BASIC AND INTERMEDIATE LEVELS OF EDUCATION.

NO STUDIES HAVE FULLY EXAMINED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY, PATIENT-PHARMACIST COMMUNICATION, AND ANTICOAGULATION CONTROL. OBJECTIVE(S): TO EVALUATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND THE PERCEIVED QUALITY OF PATIENT-PHARMACIST COMMUNICATION AMONG THOSE RECEIVING ANTICOAGULATION THERAPY. METHODS: THIS INVESTIGATION UTILIZED STRUCTURED TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS TO EVALUATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND PERCEIVED QUALITY PATIENT-PHARMACIST COMMUNICATION AMONG PATIENTS RECEIVING ANTICOAGULATION THERAPY. TWO HUNDRED-TWENTY PARTICIPANTS PRESCRIBED ANTICOAGULATION THERAPY CONTINUOUSLY FOR AT LEAST 6-MONTHS SERVED AS THE SAMPLE FOR THIS STUDY. A PREVIOUSLY VALIDATED ONE-ITEM SCREENING TOOL WAS UTILIZED TO ESTIMATE HEALTH LITERACY. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS PATIENTS' PERCEPTIONS REGARDING THE GENERAL COMMUNICATION PROCESS WITH PHARMACISTS, ACCORDING TO THE INTERPERSONAL PROCESS OF CARE QUESTIONNAIRE. RESULTS: PATIENTS POSSESSING INADEQUATE HEALTH LITERACY REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FAVORABLE RATINGS FOR THE PERCEIVED QUALITY OF PHARMACIST COMMUNICATION ON THE DOMAINS OF GENERAL CLARITY (P=0.02), RESPONSIVENESS TO PATIENT CONCERNS (P=<0.01), EMPOWERMENT (P=0.01), AND CONSIDERATION OF PATIENTS' DESIRE AND ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH RECOMMENDATIONS (P=0.01). INADEQUATE HEALTH LITERACY WAS FOUND TO BE INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH POORER QUALITY INTERPERSONAL PROCESSES OF CARE ACROSS THE DOMAINS OF RESPONSIVENESS TO PATIENT CONCERNS AND EMPOWERMENT, (=-0.207, P = <0.01 AND =-0.137, P=0.04, RESPECTIVELY). PATIENTS WITH INADEQUATE HEALTH LITERACY DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THOSE WITH ADEQUATE HEALTH LITERACY IN TERMS OF TIME WITHIN THERAPEUTIC INR RANGE OR PERCENT OF INRS IN THERAPEUTIC RANGE OVER THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS. CONCLUSIONS: PATIENTS RECEIVING ANTICOAGULATION THERAPY AND POSSESSING INADEQUATE HEALTH LITERACY APPEAR MORE LIKELY TO PERCIEVE POORER COMMUNICATION WITH PHARMACISTS. THIS SEEMS ESPECIALLY TRUE AS IT RELATES TO THE PERCIEVED TIME AND ATTENTION PHARMACIST DEVOTE TO THE COMMUNICATION ENCOUNTER, AS WELL AS THE SENSE PHARMACISTS PROVIDE PATIENTS CONCERNING THEIR ABILITY TO INFLUENCE HEALTH OUTCOMES.","CENTER FOR POPULATION HEALTH AND RURAL MEDICINE, UNION UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF PHARMACY, 1050 UNION UNIVERSITY DRIVE, JACKSON, TN 38305, USA.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: SKING@UU.;EDU.; WEST TENNESSEE HEALTHCARE, NORTH, 367 HOSPITAL BLVD, JACKSON, TN 38305, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACY PRACTICE, UNION UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF PHARMACY, 1050 UNION UNIVERSITY DRIVE, JACKSON, TN 38305, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACY PRACTICE, UNION UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF PHARMACY, 1050 UNION UNIVERSITY DRIVE, JACKSON, TN 38305, USA.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT 2020 ELSEVIER INC.

AS HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS MOVE FROM CRISIS MOBILIZATION TO A NEW LANDSCAPE OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL NEEDS, ORGANIZATIONAL HEALTH LITERACY OFFERS PRACTICAL BUILDING BLOCKS TO PROVIDE HIGH-QUALITY, EFFICIENT, AND MEANINGFUL CARE TO PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. ORGANIZATIONAL HEALTH LITERACY IS DEFINED BY THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE AS \"THE DEGREE TO WHICH AN ORGANIZATION IMPLEMENTS POLICIES, PRACTICES, AND SYSTEMS THAT MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO NAVIGATE, UNDERSTAND, AND USE INFORMATION AND SERVICES TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR HEALTH.\" METHODS: THIS ARTICLE SYNTHESIZES INSIGHTS FROM ORGANIZATIONAL HEALTH LITERACY IN THE CONTEXT OF CURRENT MAJOR HEALTH CARE CHALLENGES AND TOWARD THE GOAL OF INNOVATION IN PATIENT-CENTERED CARE. WE FIRST PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE ORIGINS AND OUTLINES OF ORGANIZATIONAL HEALTH LITERACY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE. SECOND, USING AN ESTABLISHED PATIENT-CENTERED INNOVATION FRAMEWORK, WE SHOW HOW THE EXISTING WORK ON ORGANIZATIONAL HEALTH LITERACY CAN OFFER A MENU OF EFFECTIVE, PATIENT-CENTERED INNOVATIVE OPTIONS FOR CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS TO IMPROVE SYSTEMS AND OUTCOMES. FINALLY, WE CONSIDER THE HIGH VALUE OF MANAGEMENT FOCUSING ON ORGANIZATIONAL HEALTH LITERACY EFFORTS, SPECIFICALLY FOR PATIENTS IN HEALTH CARE TRANSITIONS AND IN THE RAPID TRANSFORMATION OF CARE INTO MYRIAD DISTANCE MODALITIES. RESULTS: THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES PRACTICAL GUIDANCE FOR SYSTEMS AND INFORMS DECISIONS AROUND RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND ORGANIZATIONAL PRIORITIES TO BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF PATIENT POPULATIONS EVEN IN THE FACE OF FINANCIAL AND WORKFORCE DISRUPTION. CONCLUSIONS: ORGANIZATIONAL HEALTH LITERACY PRINCIPLES AND GUIDELINES PROVIDE A ROAD MAP FOR PROMOTING PATIENT-CENTERED CARE EVEN IN THIS TIME OF CRISIS, CHANGE, AND TRANSFORMATION. HEALTH SYSTEM LEADERS SEEKING INNOVATIVE APPROACHES CAN HAVE ACCESS TO WELL-ESTABLISHED TOOL KITS, GUIDING MODELS, AND MATERIALS TOWARD MANY ORGANIZATIONAL HEALTH LITERACY GOALS ACROSS TREATMENT, DIAGNOSIS, PREVENTION, EDUCATION, RESEARCH, AND OUTREACH.","OFFICE OF PUBLIC HEALTH STUDIES, UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI'I AT MNOA, HONOLULU, HAWAII (DR SENTELL AND MR PATIL); ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY EDSON COLLEGE OF NURSING AND HEALTHCARE INNOVATIONS, PHOENIX (MS FOSS-DURANT); THE DANIEL K.; INOUYE COLLEGE OF PHARMACY, HILO, HAWAII (DR TAIRA); BOSTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS (DR PAASCHE-ORLOW); AND CENTER FOR INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE RESEARCH, KAISER PERMANENTE HAWAII, HONOLULU (DR TRINACTY).;",NA,"COPYRIGHT 2020 WOLTERS KLUWER HEALTH, INC.

RESULTS: EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS IN HIV-PARTICIPANTS SHOWED THAT THE SHARED VARIANCE BETWEEN A BATTERY OF HEALTH LITERACY MEASURES, INCLUDING HEALTH WORD READING, VERBAL COMPREHENSION, NUMERACY, AND SELF-REPORTED PROBLEMS WAS BEST EXPLAINED BY A SINGLE FACTOR. SIMILARLY, A CONFIRMATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS IN PLWH ALSO SUPPORTED A SINGLE FACTOR STRUCTURE, BUT FOR A RE-SPECIFIED FOUR-TEST SOLUTION BASED ON THE CORE PERFORMANCE-BASED MEASURES OF HEALTH LITERACY. IN ANALYSES ADJUSTING FOR DEMOGRAPHICS, PLWH DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER HEALTH LITERACY COMPOSITE SCORES AS COMPARED TO THEIR HIV-COUNTERPARTS.

DESIGN: CROSS-SECTIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDY. SETTING: POPULATION-BASED COHORT RANDOMLY SELECTED FROM THE VOTER REGISTRATION LISTS. PARTICIPANTS: INDIVIDUALS AGED 65+ (N=1066). MEASUREMENTS: THE SHORT TEST OF FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY IN ADULTS (S-TOFHLA); DEMOGRAPHICS; SELF-RATED HEALTH; NUMBER OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS; MODIFIED CENTER FOR EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDIES- DEPRESSION SCALE; MINI-MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION; WECHSLER TEST OF ADULT READING; CLINICAL DEMENTIA RATING; COGNITIVE DOMAIN COMPOSITE SCORES; INDEPENDENCE IN INSTRUMENTAL ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING AND MEDICATION MANAGEMENT; HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION (EMERGENCY/URGENT CARE VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS). RESULTS: LOW (INADEQUATE OR MARGINAL) S-TOFHLA SCORES WERE OBTAINED BY 7.04% OF THE SAMPLE. IN UNADJUSTED ANALYSES, PARTICIPANTS WITH LOW S-TOFHLA SCORES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY THAN THOSE WITH HIGHER SCORES TO BE OLDER, MALE, NON-WHITE, WITH LESSER EDUCATION AND LOWER HOUSEHOLD INCOME, TO HAVE LOWER SCORES ON THE WECHSLER TEST OF ADULT READING, THE MINI-MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION, AND ALL COGNITIVE DOMAINS; TO BE MORE DEPENDENT IN INSTRUMENTAL ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING AND BE TAKING MORE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.

AIM: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HEALTH LITERACY INTERVENTIONS ON PREGNANCY OUTCOMES THROUGH A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS. METHODS: RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS THAT ASSESSED HEALTH LITERACY INTERVENTIONS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE PREGNANCY OUTCOMES WERE INCLUDED. THE STUDY PROTOCOL WAS REGISTERED WITH PROSPERO (CRD42018094958). FINDINGS: OF THE 1512 RECORDS INITIALLY IDENTIFIED, 13 STUDIES WERE INCLUDED. THREE REPORTED ON DECISION-AID INTERVENTIONS, SIX ON FACE-TO-FACE INTERVENTIONS AND FOUR ON WRITTEN INTERVENTIONS (INCLUDING COMPUTER-BASED INTERVENTIONS OR INFORMATION LEAFLETS). THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES OF INTEREST FOR THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WERE KNOWLEDGE (10/13 STUDIES) AND HEALTH LITERACY (2/13 STUDIES) WITH ONE STUDY NOT REPORTING EITHER PRIMARY OUTCOME. A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN KNOWLEDGE WAS FOUND ACROSS THE 10 STUDIES, HOWEVER THE TWO STUDIES WHICH MEASURED HEALTH LITERACY ONLY ASSESSED HEALTH LITERACY AT A SINGLE TIME-POINT. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDING HEALTH BEHAVIOURS, FETAL OUTCOMES AND HEALTH-SERVICE UTILISATION WERE REPORTED IN 11 STUDIES, WITH INCONSISTENT RESULTS. DISCUSSION: FEW HEALTH LITERACY INTERVENTIONS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY FOR PREGNANT WOMEN. ALTHOUGH HEALTH LITERACY INTERVENTIONS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE KNOWLEDGE AND PREGNANCY OUTCOMES, CURRENT EVIDENCE IS LIMITED BY INCONSISTENT OUTCOMES AND MEASUREMENT, AND LIMITED USE OF HEALTH LITERACY THEORY TO INFORM INTERVENTION DESIGN AND CONTENT. FEW STUDIES DIRECTLY MEASURED HEALTH LITERACY. CONCLUSION: MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO PROPERLY ASSESS THE EFFECT OF HEALTH LITERACY INTERVENTIONS ON PREGNANCY OUTCOMES. THIS RESEARCH SHOULD INCLUDE CONSIDERATION OF HEALTH LITERACY THEORY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERVENTIONS.","THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME, AUSTRALIA.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: JESSICA.;ZIBELLINI@HEALTH.;NSW.;GOV.;AU.; THE UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY, FACULTY OF MEDICINE AND HEALTH, SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SYDNEY HEALTH LITERACY LAB, AUSTRALIA.; THE UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY, CHARLES PERKINS CENTRE, AUSTRALIA.; THE UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY, CHARLES PERKINS CENTRE, AUSTRALIA; THE UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY, FACULTY OF MEDICINE AND HEALTH, CENTRAL CLINICAL SCHOOL, AUSTRALIA; ROYAL PRINCE ALFRED NEWBORN CARE, ROYAL PRINCE ALFRED HOSPITAL, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT 2020 AUSTRALIAN COLLEGE OF MIDWIVES.

THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXAMINE THE MEDIATING ROLE OF HEALTH LITERACY IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A RANGE OF UPSTREAM FACTORS AND HEALTH BEHAVIORS AMONG CHINESE SECONDARY STUDENTS. A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED WITH 650 STUDENTS IN YEARS 7 TO 9 FROM FOUR SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN BEIJING. BASED ON AN ADAPTED HEALTH LITERACY FRAMEWORK FROM MANGANELLO, A SELF-ADMINISTERED QUESTIONNAIRE WAS DESIGNED TO COLLECT INFORMATION ON UPSTREAM FACTORS, HEALTH LITERACY, AND HEALTH BEHAVIORS. PATH ANALYSIS RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK WAS MOSTLY SUPPORTED BY EMPIRICAL DATA AFTER MODIFICATION INDICES WERE EXAMINED AND 3 DIRECT PATHS WERE ADDED. STUDENTS' SELF-EFFICACY, SOCIAL SUPPORT, AND SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTH LITERACY, WHICH IN TURN PREDICTED HEALTH BEHAVIORS.

WOMEN WITH PCOS EXPERIENCE CHALLENGES IN ADOPTING AND MAINTAINING HEALTHY LIFESTYLE BEHAVIOURS, WHICH MAY BE RELATED TO HEALTH LITERACY. THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY WERE TO EXPLORE THE HEALTH LITERACY NEEDS OF WOMEN WITH PCOS IN LIFESTYLE AND WEIGHT MANAGEMENT TO INFORM RESEARCH AND PRACTICE. METHODS: TEN WOMEN WITH PCOS PARTICIPATED IN FOCUS GROUPS AND SEMI-STRUCTURED TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS ON LIFESTYLE AND WEIGHT MANAGEMENT IN PCOS. RESULTS: FOR FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY, WOMEN WITH PCOS ARE HIGHLY MOTIVATED FOR LIFESTYLE AND WEIGHT MANAGEMENT DUE TO THE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF PCOS. FOR INTERACTIVE HEALTH LITERACY, BARRIERS INCLUDED DELAYED DIAGNOSIS AND POOR COMMUNICATION. WOMEN WITH PCOS WERE RESOURCEFUL IN ACCESSING A WIDE RANGE OF WEIGHT MANAGEMENT SERVICES BUT SOME EXPERIENCE BARRIERS SUCH AS COSTS OR THE FEELINGS OF EMBARRASSMENT ASSOCIATED WITH ACCESSING RELEVANT SERVICES. FOR CRITICAL HEALTH LITERACY, NO FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS COULD BE IDENTIFIED FOR THE DOMAIN OF PARTICIPATION IN MAKING DECISIONS FOR HEALTH. CONCLUSIONS: WOMEN WITH PCOS EXPERIENCE FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS IN FUNCTIONAL AND INTERACTIVE HEALTH LITERACY IN LIFESTYLE AND WEIGHT MANAGEMENT. SO WHAT?: FUTURE INTERVENTIONS SHOULD SEEK TO FURTHER UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS THESE GAPS IN HEALTH LITERACY BY INCREASING WEIGHT MANAGEMENT SKILLS THROUGH BEHAVIOUR CHANGE TECHNIQUES, IMPROVING HEALTH PROFESSIONAL-PATIENT COMMUNICATION THROUGH TOOLS SUCH AS QUESTION PROMPT LISTS, ENHANCING PEER SUPPORT BY INCREASING DISTRIBUTED HEALTH LITERACY IN PCOS SUPPORT GROUPS AND BY PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR CO-DESIGN OF INTERVENTIONS.","MONASH CENTRE FOR HEALTH RESEARCH AND IMPLEMENTATION, MONASH UNIVERSITY, CLAYTON, VIC, AUSTRALIA.; GRADUATE RESEARCH SCHOOL, WESTERN SYDNEY UNIVERSITY, SYDNEY, NSW, AUSTRALIA.; NICM HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE, WESTERN SYDNEY UNIVERSITY, SYDNEY, NSW, AUSTRALIA.; SCHOOL OF WOMEN'S AND CHILDREN'S HEALTH, ROYAL HOSPITAL FOR WOMEN, RANDWICK, AUSTRALIA.; SCHOOL OF SCIENCE AND HEALTH, WESTERN SYDNEY UNIVERSITY, SYDNEY, NSW, AUSTRALIA.; TRANSLATIONAL HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE, WESTERN SYDNEY UNIVERSITY, SYDNEY, NSW, AUSTRALIA.; MONASH CENTRE FOR HEALTH RESEARCH AND IMPLEMENTATION, MONASH UNIVERSITY, CLAYTON, VIC, AUSTRALIA.; MONASH CENTRE FOR HEALTH RESEARCH AND IMPLEMENTATION, MONASH UNIVERSITY, CLAYTON, VIC, AUSTRALIA.; ENDOCRINE AND DIABETES UNITS, MONASH HEALTH, CLAYTON, VIC, AUSTRALIA.; NICM HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE, WESTERN SYDNEY UNIVERSITY, SYDNEY, NSW, AUSTRALIA.;","ORCID: 0000-0002-3363-9199"," 2021 AUSTRALIAN HEALTH PROMOTION ASSOCIATION.",NA,NA,"2020/04/24 06:00","20210818","20200526",2021,"2020/04/24 06:00",NA,"H11935/28/WESTERN SYDNEY UNIVERSITY HUMAN RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEE/",NA,"1036-1073 (PRINT) 1036-1073 (LINKING)","9710936","HEALTH PROMOTION JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA : OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIAN ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PROMOTION PROFESSIONALS","ENG","10.1002/HPJA.349 [DOI]","20210818","2021/08/19 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","41-48","AUSTRALIA",NA,NA,"32323376","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"HEALTH PROMOT J AUSTR. 2021 FEB;32 SUPPL 1:41-48.

SHARED DECISIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH LESS DECISIONAL CONFLICT AND IMPROVED SATISFACTION. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND PREFERRED DECISION-MAKING ROLE IN PATIENTS SEEKING CARE FOR HAND PROBLEMS. METHODS: WE PERFORMED A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY OF 226 PATIENTS WHO WERE PRESENTING TO A HAND SERVICE FOR THE FIRST TIME, WHO WERE OLDER THAN 18 YEARS, NOT PREGNANT, AND FLUENT AND LITERATE IN ENGLISH. PATIENT DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, WORK STATUS, AND EDUCATION LEVEL WERE COLLECTED FROM THE PATIENT. DIAGNOSIS AND INSURANCE STATUS WERE COLLECTED FROM THE MEDICAL RECORD. PAIN INTERFERENCE, DEPRESSION, AND UPPER EXTREMITY FUNCTION WERE MEASURED USING THE PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES MEASUREMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PROMIS) QUESTIONNAIRES ADMINISTERED WITH COMPUTERIZED ADAPTIVE TESTING. HEALTH LITERACY AND PREFERRED DECISION-MAKING ROLE WERE ASSESSED USING THE NEWEST VITAL SIGN TEST AND CONTROL PREFERENCE SCALE, RESPECTIVELY. DISCORDANCE BETWEEN PREFERRED AND ACTUAL DECISION-MAKING ROLE WAS ASSESSED USING THE CONTROL PREFERENCE SCALE STATEMENTS WITH THE WORDS \"I PREFER\" OMITTED. BIVARIATE AND MULTIVARIABLE LOGISTIC REGRESSIONS WERE USED TO ASSESS FOR FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH PREFERRED DECISION-MAKING ROLE AND DISCORDANCE. RESULTS: SEVENTY-EIGHT PERCENT OF PATIENTS PREFERRED AN ACTIVE OR COLLABORATIVE, RATHER THAN A PASSIVE, ROLE IN DECISION MAKING. SIXTY-ONE PERCENT FELT THEY HAD ACHIEVED THEIR PREFERRED ROLE. PREFERRED ROLE AND ACHIEVEMENT OF THAT ROLE WERE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTH LITERACY, AGE, RACE, INSURANCE, WORK STATUS, DIAGNOSIS, PAIN INTENSITY, SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION, AND MAGNITUDE OF SELF-REPORTED ACTIVITY LIMITATIONS. MORE YEARS OF EDUCATION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A MORE ACTIVE PREFERRED DECISION-MAKING ROLE BUT NOT WITH OBTAINING THAT PREFERRED ROLE.

OBJECTIVE: ASSESS HEALTH LITERACY, ITS ASSOCIATION WITH ENGAGEMENT INPRIMARY CARE AND SELECT SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES, AND THE USE OF TWO HEALTH LITERACY MEASURES WITH AFRICAN IMMIGRANTS. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A COMMUNITY-BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY AMONG AFRICAN IMMIGRANTS IN MASSACHUSETTS. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE NEWEST VITAL SIGN, THE HEALTH LITERACY SKILLS INSTRUMENT, ACCEPTABILITY QUESTIONNAIRES, AND A HEALTH SURVEY. WE OBSERVED AND RECORDED COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS AS PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE SURVEYS. KEY RESULTS: OUT OF 75 PARTICIPANTS, 60% HAVE LIMITED HEALTH LITERACY. OVER 80% ARE CONNECTED TO A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND COMFORTABLE SPEAKING WITH THEIR DOCTOR/NURSE. EDUCATION, ENGLISH PROFICIENCY, COUNTRY OF ORIGIN, AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTH LITERACY. PARTICIPANTS FOUND THE MEASURES EASY TO UNDERSTAND BUT DIFFICULT TO ANSWER. OBSERVATION DATA REVEALED UNFAMILIARITY WITH NUTRITION LABELS, COOKING MEASUREMENTS, AND NAVIGATION OF INTERNET LINKS, AND THE NEED FOR CLARIFICATION OF SELECT ITEMS. CONCLUSIONS: MOST AFRICAN IMMIGRANTS IN THIS STUDY HAVE LIMITED HEALTH LITERACY DESPITE ENGLISH PROFICIENCY, COLLEGE EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT, AND CONNECTION TO A HEALTH SYSTEM.

LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW IMPAIRED HEALTH LITERACY AMONG WOMEN RECEIVING PRENATAL CARE AT INNER CITY PUBLIC HOSPITALS MAY IMPACT REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND OUTCOMES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS HEALTH LITERACY AMONG POSTPARTUM WOMEN RECEIVING CARE AT A PUBLIC TERTIARY CARE CENTER AND TO EXPLORE THE ASSOCIATION OF IMPAIRED HEALTH LITERACY WITH PRENATAL CARE ATTENDANCE AND POSTPARTUM OUTCOMES. METHODS: WRITTEN CONSENT WAS OBTAINED BEFORE COMPLETING THE 7-ITEM REALM-SF STUDY TOOL TO ASSESS HEALTH LITERACY. A SCORE OF ZERO TO THREE INDICATED LOW HEALTH LITERACY, FOUR TO SIX MODERATELY LOW HEALTH LITERACY, AND SEVEN ADEQUATE HEALTH LITERACY. PATIENTS COMPLETED A 25-ITEM DEMOGRAPHIC QUESTIONNAIRE, AND MEDICAL OUTCOMES WERE OBTAINED VIA THIS QUESTIONNAIRE AND CHART REVIEW. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WERE GENERATED, AND BIVARIATE AND MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES EVALUATED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN REALM-SF SCORE AND STUDY OUTCOMES. RESULTS: WE RECRUITED 300 ADULT ENGLISH-SPEAKING POSTPARTUM WOMEN AND 293 WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS.THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS (53.9%) EXPERIENCED IMPAIRED HEALTH LITERACY (SCORE ZERO TO SIX). MOST RESPONDENTS COMPLETED HIGH SCHOOL OR HIGHER EDUCATION (77.1%), 17.8% HAD NO PRENATAL CARE, AND 83.6% REPORTED THAT THIS PREGNANCY WAS UNPLANNED.

METHODS: FOUR QUESTIONS ASSESSING HEALTH LITERACY WERE ASKED DURING ANNUAL PHONE ENCOUNTERS WITH MULTI-ETHNIC STUDY OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS (MESA) PARTICIPANTS BETWEEN 2016 AND 2018 (N = 3629). WE USED PREVALENCE RATIOS (PRS) WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CIS) TO CHARACTERIZE HOW DEMOGRAPHIC AND ACCULTURATION FACTORS RELATED TO LIMITED HEALTH LITERACY. MODELS ADJUSTED FOR AGE, SEX, AND RACE/ETHNICITY, AND RACE/ETHNICITY-STRATIFIED MODELS WERE ALSO EXAMINED. RESULTS: LIMITED HEALTH LITERACY WAS PREVALENT IN 15.4% OF THE SAMPLE. PARTICIPANTS WHO WERE OLDER, FEMALE, LOWER-INCOME, OR LESS ACCULTURATED WERE AT GREATER RISK FOR HAVING LIMITED HEALTH LITERACY. CHINESE, HISPANIC, AND BLACK PARTICIPANTS WERE MORE LIKELY THAN WHITE PARTICIPANTS TO HAVE LIMITED HEALTH LITERACY. PATTERNS WERE SIMILAR WHEN STRATIFIED BY RACE/ETHNICITY.

METHODS: STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED THROUGH A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE SEARCH OF THE COCHRANE, EMBASE, MEDLINE, AND PSYCINFO DATABASES IN FEBRUARY 2019. THE REVIEW INCLUDED STUDIES THAT DELIVERED TRAINING TO PROFESSIONALS WHO HAVE REGULAR CONTACT WITH YOUNG PEOPLE AGED 0 TO 19 IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR ROLE AND AT LEAST ONE COMPONENT OF MENTAL HEALTH LITERACY; (A) KNOWLEDGE, (B) ATTITUDES, (C) CONFIDENCE IN HELPING, (D) INTENTION TO HELP AND (E) ACTUAL HELPING BEHAVIOUR. THE QUALITY OF PAPERS WAS REVIEWED USING THE COCHRANE REVISED RISK OF BIAS TOOL FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) AND THE INTEGRATED QUALITY CRITERIA FOR THE REVIEW OF MULTIPLE STUDY DESIGNS FOR NON RCTS. RESULTS: TWENTY-ONE STUDIES MET ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (N = 3243). THERE WAS SOME EVIDENCE THAT GLOBAL AND SPECIFIC CHILD MENTAL HEALTH LITERACY TRAINING IMPROVED PROFESSIONALS' KNOWLEDGE AND STIGMA-RELATED ATTITUDES TOWARDS MENTAL HEALTH. FEW STUDIES INVESTIGATED THE IMPACT OF TRAINING ON ACTUAL HELPING BEHAVIOUR. CONCLUSION: THERE MAY BE VALUE IN PROVIDING CHILD MENTAL HEALTH LITERACY TRAINING TO PROFESSIONALS IN CONTACT WITH CHILDREN, HOWEVER THERE IS A NEED FOR STUDIES TO EVALUATE THE LONG-TERM IMPACT OF SUCH TRAINING, PARTICULARLY ON SUBSEQUENT ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE SUPPORT.

IN ADDITION, FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF ALL THESE FACTORS ON LONGER-TERM WEIGHT LOSS OUTCOMES TO DETERMINE IF THEY INFLUENCE THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN WEIGHT LOSS. SETTING: SINGLE BARIATRIC CENTER. METHODS: PATIENTS (N = 567) WHO UNDERWENT BARIATRIC SURGERY FROM 2014-2017 COMPLETED A BRIEF SURVEY INCLUDING CURRENT WEIGHT. RETROSPECTIVE CHART REVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED TO GATHER INFORMATION FROM THE PRESURGICAL EVALUATION INCLUDING WEIGHT, BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), HEALTH LITERACY, HEALTH NUMERACY AND SCORE ON A COGNITIVE SCREENER. RESULTS: AMONG PARTICIPANTS IN THE WEIGHT LOSS PERIOD (< 2 YEARS POSTSURGERY), HEALTH LITERACY, HEALTH NUMERACY AND COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING WERE NOT RELATED TO CHANGE IN BMI (BMI), PERCENT TOTAL WEIGHT LOSS (%TWL) OR PERCENT EXCESS WEIGHT LOSS (%EWL). HOWEVER, FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE WEIGHT MAINTENANCE PERIOD (2-4 YEARS POSTSURGERY), HIGHER HEALTH LITERACY SCORES WERE RELATED TO GREATER CHANGE IN BMI, AND HIGHER HEALTH NUMERACY SCORES WERE RELATED TO GREATER BMI, %TWL, AND %EWL. DISCUSSION: ALTHOUGH HEALTH LITERACY AND HEALTH NUMERACY DID NOT PREDICT WEIGHT LOSS OUTCOMES FOR THOSE IN THE INITIAL WEIGHT LOSS PERIOD, THEY WERE RELATED TO WEIGHT OUTCOMES FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE WEIGHT MAINTENANCE PERIOD. THIS SUGGESTS THAT HEALTH LITERACY AND HEALTH NUMERACY MAY PLAY A ROLE IN FACILITATING LONGER-TERM WEIGHT MAINTENANCE AMONG PATIENTS WHO UNDERGO BARIATRIC SURGERY.

EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THAT HEALTH LITERACY (HL) IS A DETERMINANT FOR HEALTH OUTCOMES, AND WHEN HL IS LIMITED THIS MAY HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON MORBIDITY AS WELL AS MORTALITY. MIGRANTS ARE KNOWN TO HAVE LIMITED HL. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXPLORE COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH LITERACY (CHL) AND ELECTRONIC HEALTH LITERACY (EHL) AMONG ARABIC-SPEAKING MIGRANTS IN SWEDEN. METHODS: THIS WAS A CROSS-SECTIONAL OBSERVATIONAL STUDY CONDUCTED IN SWEDEN. A TOTAL OF 703 PERSONS WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE BETWEEN FEBRUARY AND SEPTEMBER 2019. TWO QUESTIONNAIRES - THE HEALTH LITERACY SURVEY EUROPEAN QUESTIONNAIRE (HLS-EU-Q16) AND THE EHEALTH LITERACY SCALE (EHEALS) - AND QUESTIONS ABOUT SELF-PERCEIVED HEALTH AND INTERNET USE WERE DISTRIBUTED IN SWEDISH AND ARABIC. VARIOUS STATISTICAL ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE ASSOCIATIONS FOR LIMITED CHL AND EHL. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 681 RESPONDENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. OF THESE, 334 (49%) WERE NATIVE ARABIC-SPEAKING MIGRANTS AND 347 (51%) WERE NATIVE SWEDISH-SPEAKING RESIDENTS. CHL AND EHL DIFFERED BETWEEN THE GROUPS. THE ARABIC SPEAKERS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER MEAN SUM SCORES IN EHL 28.1 (SD 6.1) VS 29.3 (6.2), P=0.012 AND LOWER PROPORTION OF SUFFICIENT CHL 125 (38.9%) VS 239 (71.3%), P<0.001 COMPARED TO SWEDISH SPEAKERS. MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSIS SHOWED ON ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN LIMITED CHL AND EHL AND BEING ARABIC SPEAKING, LESS INTERNET USE, AND NOT FINDING THE INTERNET TO BE IMPORTANT OR USEFUL. FURTHERMORE, LONGER TIME SPENT IN SWEDEN WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF CHL AMONG THE ARABIC SPEAKERS, (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.91-0.98, P < 0.01).

THIS STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF HEALTH LITERACY AMONG PLHIV IN INDONESIA AND ASSESS ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES, BELIEFS ABOUT MEDICINES, STIGMA AND HEALTH LITERACY. WE CONDUCTED A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY USING QUESTIONNAIRES IN PLHIV IN PAPUA, INDONESIA. THE SHORT VERSION OF THE TEST OF FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY IN ADULTS (S-TOFHLA), BELIEFS ABOUT MEDICINES QUESTIONNAIRE (BMQ) AND HIV STIGMA SCALE AS WELL AS QUESTIONS ON DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION WERE COMPLETED BY THE PARTICIPANTS FROM TWO HOSPITALS IN PAPUA, INDONESIA. IN A MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS, WE ASSESSED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES, STIGMA, BELIEFS ABOUT MEDICINE AND LOW HEALTH LITERACY. OVERALL, 331 PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED, 62.0% FEMALE, 67.0% PAPUANS. A TOTAL OF 38.5% OF PARTICIPANTS HAD LOW HEALTH LITERACY. PLHIV WITH MULTI-DOSE REGIMEN WERE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE LOW HEALTH LITERACY THAN THOSE TAKING A FIXED-DOSE COMBINATION (OR=0.51; 95%CI=0.32-0.82). PLHIV WHO HAD SOCIAL SUPPORT IN MEDICINE-TAKING WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE LOW HEALTH LITERACY (OR=1.78; 95%CI=1.07-2.97). MORE AWARENESS ABOUT MEDICATION OVERUSE (OR=1.17; 95%CI=1.06-1.29) AND MEDICATION HARM (OR=1.10; 95%CI=1.01-1.20) WERE ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING LOW HEALTH LITERACY.

METHODS: PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, SPONDYLOARTHRITIS, AND GOUT FROM 3 HOSPITALS IN DIFFERENT REGIONS IN THE NETHERLANDS COMPLETED THE HEALTH LITERACY QUESTIONNAIRE (HLQ). HIERARCHICAL CLUSTER ANALYSIS WAS USED TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS' HEALTH LITERACY PROFILES BASED ON 9 HLQ DOMAINS. A MULTINOMIAL REGRESSION MODEL WITH THE IDENTIFIED HEALTH LITERACY PROFILES AS THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE WAS FITTED TO ASSESS WHETHER PATIENTS WITH A GIVEN DISEASE TYPE OR ATTENDING A GIVEN HOSPITAL WERE MORE LIKELY TO BELONG TO A SPECIFIC PROFILE. RESULTS: AMONG 895 PARTICIPATING PATIENTS, THE LOWEST MEAN HLQ DOMAIN SCORES (INDICATING MOST DIFFICULTY) WERE FOUND FOR \"CRITICAL APPRAISAL,\" \"NAVIGATING THE HEALTH SYSTEM,\" AND \"FINDING GOOD HEALTH INFORMATION.\" THE 10 IDENTIFIED PROFILES REVEALED SUBSTANTIAL DIVERSITY IN COMBINATIONS OF STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES. WHILE 42% OF PATIENTS SCORED MODERATE TO HIGH ON ALL 9 DOMAINS (PROFILES 1 AND 3), ANOTHER 42% OF PATIENTS (PROFILES 2, 4, 5, AND 6) CLEARLY STRUGGLED WITH 1 OR SEVERAL ASPECTS OF HEALTH LITERACY. NOTABLY, 16% (PROFILES 7-10) EXHIBITED DIFFICULTY ACROSS A MAJORITY OF HEALTH LITERACY DOMAINS. THE PROBABILITY OF BELONGING TO ONE OF THE PROFILES WAS INDEPENDENT OF THE HOSPITAL WHERE THE PATIENT WAS TREATED OR THE TYPE OF RHEUMATIC DISEASE. CONCLUSION: TEN DISTINCT HEALTH LITERACY PROFILES WERE IDENTIFIED AMONG PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATIC DISEASES, INDEPENDENT OF DISEASE TYPE AND TREATING HOSPITAL.

ENGAGING EHEALTH REQUIRES A SKILL SET, OR LITERACY, OF ITS OWN. THE PRESENT STUDY IS AN EFFORT TO PROBE THE RELATIONSHIP OF EDUCATION AND INSTITUTION (INDEPENDENT VARIABLES) WITH THE USAGE AND EXPERTISE IN EHEALTH LITERACY (DEPENDENT VARIABLES) AMONG UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. THE RESEARCH IS CONDUCTED IN 16 HIGHER EDUCATION COMMISSION (HEC) PAKISTAN'S RECOGNIZED UNIVERSITIES IN LAHORE. BOTH MALE AND FEMALE STUDENTS RANGING FROM BS TO PHD PROGRAMS WERE THE FOCUS OF THE RESEARCH. METHODS: QUANTITATIVE DATA WAS COLLECTED THROUGH SURVEY METHOD USING STRATIFIED RANDOM SAMPLING TECHNIQUE. THERE WERE DIFFERENT KINDS OF STRATA IN POPULATION I.E. GENERAL UNIVERSITIES, HEALTH SCIENCES UNIVERSITIES, ENGINEERING UNIVERSITIES AND ANIMAL SCIENCES UNIVERSITIES ETC. THE RESEARCH ENCOMPASSED A TOTAL OF 89,664 STUDENTS IN 16 UNIVERSITIES, FROM WHICH SAMPLE SIZE OF 1513 WAS DRAWN THROUGH RESEARCH ADVISOR TABLE (2006). PROPORTIONAL ALLOCATION FORMULA WAS USED TO SPECIFY THE NUMBER OF RESPONDENTS FROM EACH UNIVERSITY. NON-PARAMETRIC STATISTICS WAS USED SINCE DATA WAS NOT NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED. KRUSKAL-WALLIS H TEST AND MANN-WHITNEY U TEST WERE APPLIED TO MEASURE THE DIFFERENCE OF EFFECT OF GROUPS OF INDEPENDENT VARIABLES ON THE DEPENDENT VARIABLES. RESULTS: THE LEVEL OF USING DIGITAL HEALTH LITERACY WAS NOT SAME FOR ALL STUDENTS, AS THE STUDENTS OF PHD AND BS/MASTERS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER IN TERMS OF THEIR USAGE OF DIGITAL HEALTH LITERACY. LEVEL OF EDUCATION SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON LEVEL OF EXPERTISE IN EHEALTH LITERACY, CONFIRMING THAT CHANGING THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION HAD AN EFFECT ON LEVEL OF EXPERTISE IN DIGITAL HEALTH LITERACY, BUT THE SIZE OF EFFECT WAS SMALLER. MS/MPHIL AND PHD STUDENTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER IN THEIR EXPERTISE IN DIGITAL HEALTH LITERACY.

WE DEVELOPED THE COMMUNITY HEALTH LITERACY ASSESSMENT (CHLA) FRAMEWORK TO DESCRIBE COUNTY AND REGIONAL HEALTH LITERACY ACTIVITIES, ASSETS, GAPS, AND OPPORTUNITIES IN MARYLAND. METHODS: WE IMPLEMENTED THE CHLA FRAMEWORK IN MARYLAND FROM JANUARY TO AUGUST 2018. WE CONDUCTED AN ENVIRONMENTAL SCAN OF MARYLAND'S 24 COUNTIES TO IDENTIFY COMMUNITY RESOURCES, HEALTH INDICATORS, AND ORGANIZATIONS. WE TARGETED LOCAL HEALTH IMPROVEMENT COALITIONS AND HEALTH DEPARTMENTS FOR INTERVIEWS IN EACH COUNTY. WE CONDUCTED QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT KEY COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT MARYLAND ARE DOING TO IMPLEMENT HEALTH LITERACY BEST PRACTICES AND POLICIES. WE USED SUMMATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS TO REVIEW, QUANTIFY, AND INTERPRET INTERVIEW DATA. RESULTS: WE CONDUCTED 57 INTERVIEWS WITH PARTICIPANTS FROM 56 ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING ALL 24 COUNTIES IN MARYLAND. WE CAPTURED DATA ON MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS OF HEALTH LITERACY AND IDENTIFIED 3 MAIN THEMES: HEALTH LITERACY ASSETS AND ACTIVITIES, HEALTH LITERACY GAPS, AND HEALTH LITERACY OPPORTUNITIES. THE MOST CITED ASSET WAS COLLECTING DATA TO INFORM HEALTH LITERACY PRACTICES, THE MOST CITED GAP WAS USING JARGON WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS, AND THE MOST CITED OPPORTUNITY WAS INCREASING PUBLIC AWARENESS OF EXISTING HEALTH PROGRAMS THROUGH IMPROVED OUTREACH AND TEACHING HEALTH INFORMATION-SEEKING BEHAVIORS. CONCLUSION: A SYSTEMATIC COMMUNITY HEALTH LITERACY ASSESSMENT IS A FEASIBLE WAY TO COLLECT A LARGE AMOUNT OF HEALTH LITERACY DATA, WHICH CAN INFORM STRATEGIC PLANNING, DETERMINE COMMUNITY INTERVENTIONS, AND ULTIMATELY LEAD US TOWARD A HEALTH-LITERATE SOCIETY. WE RECOMMEND THAT OTHERS REPLICATE THE CHLA FRAMEWORK TO OPERATIONALIZE HEALTH LITERACY AS A HEALTH INDICATOR AND INCLUDE IT AS A COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT MEASURE.","3421 CANCER PREVENTION FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM, DIVISION OF CANCER PREVENTION, NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE, ROCKVILLE, MD, USA.; 1068 HERSCHEL S.; HOROWITZ CENTER FOR HEALTH LITERACY, SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK, MD, USA.; 1068 HERSCHEL S.; HOROWITZ CENTER FOR HEALTH LITERACY, SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK, MD, USA.; 1068 HERSCHEL S.; HOROWITZ CENTER FOR HEALTH LITERACY, SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK, MD, USA.;",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021/03/12 05:41",NA,"20210311",2021,"2021/03/13 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"1468-2877 (ELECTRONIC) 0033-3549 (LINKING)","9716844","PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS (WASHINGTON, D.C. : 1974)","ENG","10.1177/00333549211002767 [DOI]","20210312","2021/03/13 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","333549211002767","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"33706612","AHEADOFPRINT",NA,"IM",NA,"PUBLIC HEALTH REP. 2021 MAR 11:333549211002767.

WE EXAMINED INDEPENDENT EFFECTS OF INCOME, EDUCATION, AND HEALTH LITERACY ON PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES IN SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS (SLE). METHODS: DATA FROM THE CALIFORNIA LUPUS EPIDEMIOLOGY STUDY (N = 323 PARTICIPANTS) WERE USED. HEALTH LITERACY WAS ASSESSED WITH A VALIDATED 3-ITEM MEASURE (ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND WRITTEN INFORMATION, RELIANCE ON OTHERS TO UNDERSTAND WRITTEN INFORMATION, CONFIDENCE IN COMPLETING WRITTEN FORMS). PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES WERE ADMINISTERED BY INTERVIEW IN ENGLISH, SPANISH, CANTONESE, OR MANDARIN. GENERIC AND DISEASE-SPECIFIC PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES WERE EXAMINED USING THE FOLLOWING: 10 PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES MEASUREMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PROMIS) SHORT FORMS; THE 8 SHORT FORM 36 (SF-36) HEALTH SURVEY SUBSCALES; AND 3 PATIENT-REPORTED SLE DISEASE ACTIVITY AND DAMAGE MEASURES. WE CONDUCTED 2 SETS OF MULTIVARIABLE ANALYSES: THE FIRST EXAMINED EDUCATION, INCOME, OR HEALTH LITERACY INDIVIDUALLY; THE SECOND INCLUDED ALL 3 SIMULTANEOUSLY. ALL MULTIVARIABLE MODELS INCLUDED AGE, SEX, RACE/ETHNICITY, LANGUAGE, DISEASE DURATION, AND PHYSICIAN-ASSESSED DISEASE ACTIVITY AND DAMAGE. RESULTS: MORE THAN ONE-THIRD OF PARTICIPANTS (38%) HAD LIMITED HEALTH LITERACY (LHL), INCLUDING >25% WITH GREATER THAN HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION. IN MULTIVARIABLE ANALYSES SIMULTANEOUSLY CONSIDERING EDUCATION, INCOME, AND HEALTH LITERACY, LHL WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE SCORES ON ALL PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES EXCEPT DISEASE DAMAGE.

AS A SOCIAL DETERMINANT, HEALTH LITERACY IS COMPOUNDED BY INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE SERVICE PROVIDER, THE INDIVIDUAL, AND THEIR WIDER COMMUNITY. SCHOOLS PROVIDE A CRITICAL NEXUS BETWEEN THE TEACHER (AS SERVICE PROVIDER), THE STUDENT (AS LEARNER) AND THEIR FAMILY (CARERS AND WIDER COMMUNITY) TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN'S HEALTH LITERACY. METHODS: FIVE TASMANIAN PRIMARY SCHOOLS (84 TEACHERS) COMPLETED AN ASSESSMENT OF THEIR SCHOOL IN RELATION TO THE DOMAINS OF A HEALTH LITERATE ORGANISATION USING THE HELLOTAS! (HEALTH LITERACY LEARNING ORGANISATIONS TASMANIA) SELF-ASSESSMENT CHECKLIST, BEFORE AND AFTER TAKING PART IN THE HEALTHLIT4KIDS PROGRAM. RESULTS: WHILE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION RATINGS WERE NOT LARGE, THEY MOVED IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION FOR ALL SIX DOMAINS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT MAIN EFFECT OF TIME, F (1, 4)=83.9, P<.001, (2) =0.99, SHOWING THAT OVERALL RATINGS INCREASED FROM BEFORE TO AFTER THE INTERVENTION. TEACHER-RECOMMENDED ACTIONS ACROSS ALL SCHOOLS WERE GROUPED FOR INSIGHT INTO THEIR INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF THE TOOL IN THE SCHOOL CONTEXT. CONCLUSION: USING THE HELLOTAS! SELF-ASSESSMENT CHECKLIST SERVED A DUAL PURPOSE. TEACHERS DEVELOPED A SHARED UNDERSTANDING OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A HEALTH-LITERATE ORGANISATION TO PRODUCE A SCHOOLWIDE ACTION PLAN. SIMULTANEOUSLY, WE GAINED VALUABLE INSIGHTS INTO THE PROCESSES REQUIRED TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF ORGANISATIONAL HEALTH LITERACY IN SCHOOLS, AND WE SHARE TEN PROPOSITIONS APPLICABLE TO OTHER SCHOOLS LOCALLY, NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. SO WHAT?: TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT A SCHOOL'S HEALTH LITERACY RESPONSIVENESS HAS BEEN MEASURED.

SINCE UNIVERSITY IS A TURNING POINT WHEN YOUNG ADULTS BEGIN TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN HEALTH, UNDERSTANDING UNIVERSITY STUDENTS' HEALTH LITERACY LEVELS IS CRUCIAL. TO THIS END, WE AIMED TO EXPLORE HEALTH LITERACY AND ITS ASSOCIATED FACTORS AMONG PALESTINIAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. WE CONDUCTED A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY AT BIRZEIT UNIVERSITY IN THE RAMALLAH DISTRICT. WE RECRUITED 472 STUDENTS USING CONVENIENCE SAMPLING AT SIX ON-CAMPUS CAFETERIAS. THE 44-ITEM ARABIC VERSION OF THE HEALTH LITERACY QUESTIONNAIRE WAS USED TO MEASURE STUDENTS' HEALTH LITERACY LEVELS, WHILE A LOCALLY DEVELOPED DISTRESS SCALE WAS USED TO MEASURE STUDENTS' DISTRESS LEVELS. WE STRATIFIED THE MULTIPLE REGRESSION MODEL FOR THE HEALTH LITERACY SCORE BY GENDER. STUDENTS' AVERAGE TOTAL HEALTH LITERACY SCORE WAS 135.3 (SD 20.9), WITH MALE STUDENTS SCORING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN FEMALE STUDENTS. A HIGHER HEALTH LITERACY SCORE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING A FATHER WITH A HIGHER LEVEL OF EDUCATION, A HIGHER FREQUENCY OF MEDICAL CHECKUPS, HIGHER SELF-REPORTED HEALTH STATUS, AND CONSULTING A HIGHER NUMBER OF SOURCES FOR HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION. HIGH DISTRESS LEVELS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER LEVELS OF HEALTH LITERACY, ESPECIALLY AMONG FEMALE STUDENTS. THIS STUDY PROVIDES THE FIRST EVIDENCE ON PALESTINIAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS' HEALTH LITERACY LEVELS. TAILORED HEALTH EDUCATION AND PROMOTION ARE REQUIRED FOR STUDENTS WITH LOW PARENTAL EDUCATION AND MODERATE TO HIGH DISTRESS.

POOR HEALTH LITERACY HAS RECENTLY BECOME AN OBSTACLE IN THE ACCESSIBILITY AND UTILIZATION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE VULNERABLE POPULATION, LEADING TO ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES. THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXAMINE WHETHER HEALTH LITERACY AFFECTED HEALTH OUTCOMES IN CHINA'S FLOATING POPULATION AND WHETHER HEALTH SERVICE UTILIZATION HAD A MEDIATING EFFECT BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND HEALTH OUTCOMES. METHOD: THE CURRENT STUDY UTILIZED A CROSS-SECTIONAL STRATIFIED, MULTISTAGE, PROPORTIONAL TO SCALE (PPS) STUDY IN ZHEJIANG PROVINCE, CHINA, IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 2019. IN TOTAL, 657 VALID SELF-REPORTED QUESTIONNAIRES WERE RECOVERED AND USED FOR DATA COLLECTION. QUESTIONNAIRES INCLUDED QUESTIONS REGARDING SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, HEALTH LITERACY, HEALTH OUTCOMES, AND HEALTH SERVICE UTILIZATION. CONFIRMATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS WAS USED TO TEST QUESTIONNAIRE VALIDITY; DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WERE USED TO UNDERSTAND THE DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FLOATING POPULATION; AND STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING WAS USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER HEALTH SERVICE UTILIZATION MEDIATED HEALTH LITERACY AND HEALTH OUTCOMES. RESULTS: WE REPORT POSITIVE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY, HEALTH SERVICE UTILIZATION, AND HEALTH OUTCOMES. MEDIATION ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATED THAT HEALTH SERVICE UTILIZATION HAD PARTIAL MEDIATING EFFECTS BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND HEALTH OUTCOMES. IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND HEALTH OUTCOMES, THE INDIRECT EFFECTS OF HEALTH SERVICE UTILIZATION ACCOUNTED FOR 6.6-8.7% OF THE TOTAL EFFECTS. CONCLUSION: COMPLETE HEALTH LITERACY, THROUGH HEALTH CARE LITERACY AND HEALTH PROMOTION LITERACY, AFFECTS THE MOBILE POPULATION'S INITIATIVE TO USE HEALTH SERVICES, WHICH, IN TURN, AFFECTS HEALTH OUTCOMES. THUS, IMPROVING THE HEALTH LITERACY OF THE FLOATING POPULATION WILL HELP TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. FURTHERMORE, HEALTH SERVICE PROVIDERS SHOULD ENHANCE THE DIVERSITY OF HEALTH SERVICE SUPPLY TO ENSURE THAT THE FLOATING POPULATION HAS THE EXTERNAL RESOURCES TO IMPROVE PERSONAL HEALTH LITERACY.","7B304, SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT, WENZHOU MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, CHASHAN TOWN, OUHAI DISTRICT, WENZHOU CITY, CHINA.; YUHAIYANFEI@163.;COM.; SHAOXING COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES, 508 HUANCHENG WEST ROAD, SHAOXING, CHINA.; YUHAIYANFEI@163.;COM.; 7B304, SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT, WENZHOU MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, CHASHAN TOWN, OUHAI DISTRICT, WENZHOU CITY, CHINA.; 7B304, SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT, WENZHOU MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, CHASHAN TOWN, OUHAI DISTRICT, WENZHOU CITY, CHINA.; SHAOXING COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES, 508 HUANCHENG WEST ROAD, SHAOXING, CHINA.;",NA,NA,"THE AUTHORS DECLARE THAT THEY HAVE NO COMPETING INTERESTS.",NA,"2021/04/09 05:32","20210521","20210408",2021,"2021/04/10 06:00",NA,"(NO.17BZZ054)./NATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE FUND OF CHINA/","1","1471-2458 (ELECTRONIC) 1471-2458 (LINKING)","100968562","BMC PUBLIC HEALTH","ENG","10.1186/S12889-021-10662-7 [DOI] 691","20210521","2021/05/22 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","691",NA,"PMC8030651",NA,"33832480","EPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"BMC PUBLIC HEALTH. 2021 APR 8;21(1):691.

WHILE A PREVIOUS STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT HEALTH AND EHEALTH LITERACY ARE RELATED TO COVID-19 PREVENTION BEHAVIORS, FEW STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY, EHEALTH LITERACY, AND COVID-19-RELATED HEALTH BEHAVIORS. THE LATTER INCLUDES NOT ONLY PREVENTATIVE BEHAVIORS BUT ALSO CONVENTIONAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEVELOP AND VERIFY A COVID-19-RELATED HEALTH BEHAVIOR QUESTIONNAIRE, EXPLORE ITS STATUS AND STRUCTURE, AND EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN THESE BEHAVIORS AND PARTICIPANTS' HEALTH LITERACY AND EHEALTH LITERACY. METHODS: A SNOWBALL SAMPLING METHOD WAS ADOPTED TO RECRUIT PARTICIPANTS TO COMPLETE ANONYMOUS CROSS-SECTIONAL QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEYS ONLINE THAT ASSESSED SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, SELF-REPORTED CORONAVIRUS KNOWLEDGE, HEALTH LITERACY, EHEALTH LITERACY, AND COVID-19-RELATED HEALTH BEHAVIORS. RESULTS: OF 1873 COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO WERE RECRUITED, 781 (41.7%) HAD ADEQUATE HEALTH LITERACY; THE MEAN EHEALTH LITERACY SCORE WAS 30.16 (SD 6.31). THE COVID-19-RELATED HEALTH BEHAVIOR QUESTIONNAIRE PRESENTED A TWO-FACTOR STRUCTURE-COVID-19-SPECIFIC PRECAUTIONARY BEHAVIORS AND CONVENTIONAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS-WITH SATISFACTORY FIT INDICES AND INTERNAL CONSISTENCY (CRONBACH =.79). THE MEAN SCORE OF COVID-19-RELATED HEALTH BEHAVIORS WAS 53.77 (SD 8.03), AND SCORES DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY (P<.05) WITH RESPECT TO RESIDENCE, COLLEGE YEAR, ACADEMIC MAJOR, FAMILY ECONOMIC LEVEL, SELF-REPORTED HEALTH STATUS, HAVING A FAMILY MEMBER OR FRIEND INFECTED WITH CORONAVIRUS, AND HEALTH LITERACY LEVEL. LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT HEALTH LITERACY AND EHEALTH LITERACY WERE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19-SPECIFIC PRECAUTIONARY BEHAVIORS ((HEALTH LITERACY)=.149, (EHEALTH LITERACY)=.368; P<.001) AND CONVENTIONAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS ((HEALTH LITERACY)=.219, (EHEALTH LITERACY)=.277; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: THE COVID-19-RELATED HEALTH BEHAVIOR QUESTIONNAIRE WAS A VALID AND RELIABLE MEASURE FOR ASSESSING HEALTH BEHAVIORS DURING THE PANDEMIC. COLLEGE STUDENTS WITH HIGHER HEALTH LITERACY AND EHEALTH LITERACY CAN MORE ACTIVELY ADOPT COVID-19-RELATED HEALTH BEHAVIORS. ADDITIONALLY, COMPARED TO HEALTH LITERACY, EHEALTH LITERACY IS MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO COVID-19-RELATED HEALTH BEHAVIORS. PUBLIC INTERVENTION MEASURES BASED ON HEALTH AND EHEALTH LITERACY ARE REQUIRED TO PROMOTE COVID-19-RELATED HEALTH BEHAVIORS DURING THE PANDEMIC, WHICH MAY BE HELPFUL TO REDUCE THE RISK OF COVID-19 INFECTION AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS.","DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT, XIANGYA SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY, CHANGSHA, CHINA.; SCHOOL OF ACUPUNCTURE AND TUINA, SHANDONG UNIVERSITY OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE, JINAN, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS, MZUZU UNIVERSITY, LUWINGA, MALAWI.; DEPARTMENT OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND HEALTH STATISTICS, XIANGYA SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY, CHANGSHA, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT, XIANGYA SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY, CHANGSHA, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT, XIANGYA SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY, CHANGSHA, CHINA.;","ORCID: 0000-0003-1366-5813 ORCID: 0000-0003-2050-6191 ORCID: 0000-0002-6556-4590 ORCID: 0000-0002-3379-4818 ORCID: 0000-0003-4845-2252","SHAOJIE LI, GUANGHUI CUI, ATIPATSA CHIWANDA KAMINGA, SIXIANG CHENG, HUILAN XU.

STUDIES WORLDWIDE DEMONSTRATE THAT WOMEN PLAY A KEY ROLE IN DEVELOPING HEALTH LITERACY. HENCE, THIS STUDY'S PURPOSE IS TO EXPLORE HEALTH LITERACY OF WOMEN IN AFGHANISTAN AND THE ASSOCIATED FACTORS. METHODS: FROM MAY TO JUNE 2017, WE RANDOMLY RECRUITED 7-10 WOMEN PER DAY AT THE HOSPITAL IN GHAZNI, A REPRESENTATIVE PROVINCE OF AFGHANISTAN. TWO TRAINED FEMALE INTERVIEWERS INTERVIEWED 322 WOMEN (15-61 YEARS OLD) ORALLY IN DARI OR PASHTO ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS AND ASSESSED THEIR HEALTH LITERACY USING THE HLS-EU-Q16, ASSOCIATED SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHICS, AND HEALTH BEHAVIOR. RESULTS: HEALTH LITERACY OF WOMEN (AMONG EDUCATED AND ILLITERATES) IS LOW EVEN COMPARED TO OTHER ASIAN COUNTRIES. HEALTH LITERACY IS LINKED TO AGE AND EDUCATION. WE FOUND MIXED EVIDENCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND CONTEXTUAL FACTORS, HELP-SEEKING, AND HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIOR. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY PROVIDES NOVEL DATA ON HEALTH LITERACY AND ASTONISHING INSIGHTS INTO ITS ASSOCIATION WITH HEALTH BEHAVIOR OF WOMEN IN AFGHANISTAN, THUS CONTRIBUTING TO HEALTH STATUS.

THIS STUDY EXPLORED THE FEASIBILITY OF COLLECTING HEALTH LITERACY DATA FROM AUSTRALIAN SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND PILOTED THREE HEALTH LITERACY INSTRUMENTS. METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO RECRUIT FOUR GOVERNMENT SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN MELBOURNE. ACTIVE, OPT-IN CONSENT WAS OBTAINED FROM PARENTS AND STUDENTS IN YEARS 7-9, AND AN ONLINE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED. THREE HEALTH LITERACY INSTRUMENTS WERE USED: THE 8-ITEM HEALTH LITERACY ASSESSMENT TOOL (HLAT-8), THE NEWEST VITAL SIGN (NVS), AND THE 47-ITEM HEALTH LITERACY SURVEY (HLS-47). RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 120 STUDENTS (AGE 12-15YEARS) WERE FINALLY RECRUITED FROM ONE SCHOOL, WHEREAS THE OTHER THREE SCHOOLS DECLINED DUE TO BUSY EDUCATIONAL COMMITMENT OR NO INTEREST IN RESEARCH. LEARNINGS AND REFLECTIONS ON DATA COLLECTION INCLUDED: A SHARED PERSPECTIVE OF HEALTH LITERACY EVALUATION BETWEEN SCHOOL AND RESEARCHERS; THE FEASIBILITY OF ONLINE DATA COLLECTION; AND THE POSSIBILITY OF OBTAINING PASSIVE, OPT-OUT CONSENT. ABOUT ONE-QUARTER (23.7%-32.2%) OF STUDENTS WERE LIKELY TO HAVE POOR HEALTH LITERACY. CONCLUSIONS: ALTHOUGH THE RECRUITMENT WAS CHALLENGING, THIS PILOT STUDY INDICATES THE FEASIBILITY OF LARGE-SCALE ONLINE HEALTH LITERACY SURVEY IN FUTURE SCHOOL-BASED RESEARCH. SO WHAT?: MEASURING AND MONITORING ADOLESCENT HEALTH LITERACY IS ESSENTIAL TO ACHIEVE THE AIM OF THE AUSTRALIAN CURRICULUM OF HEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION. MORE IMPLEMENTATION RESEARCH IS NEEDED WITH REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLES TO VALIDATE HEALTH LITERACY INSTRUMENTS AND EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF HEALTH LITERACY ON HEALTH PROMOTION OUTCOMES IN AUSTRALIAN ADOLESCENTS.","CENTRE FOR COMMUNITY CHILD HEALTH, MURDOCH CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE, ROYAL CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA.; MELBOURNE SCHOOL OF POPULATION AND GLOBAL HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE, MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA.; DEPARTMENT OF PEDIATRICS, UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE, MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA.; MELBOURNE SCHOOL OF POPULATION AND GLOBAL HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE, MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA.; MELBOURNE SCHOOL OF POPULATION AND GLOBAL HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE, MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA.; INSTITUTE OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH, SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, PEKING UNIVERSITY, BEIJING, CHINA.; MELBOURNE SCHOOL OF POPULATION AND GLOBAL HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE, MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA.;","ORCID: 0000-0001-5737-4765 ORCID: 0000-0001-7163-3022"," 2021 AUSTRALIAN HEALTH PROMOTION ASSOCIATION.",NA,NA,"2020/09/24 17:16","20210818","20201019",2021,"2020/09/25 06:00",NA,"VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT'S OPERATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT PROGRAM/",NA,"1036-1073 (PRINT) 1036-1073 (LINKING)","9710936","HEALTH PROMOTION JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA : OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIAN ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PROMOTION PROFESSIONALS","ENG","10.1002/HPJA.425 [DOI]","20210818","2021/08/19 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","128-132","AUSTRALIA",NA,NA,"32970906","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"HEALTH PROMOT J AUSTR. 2021 FEB;32 SUPPL 1:128-132.

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE HEALTH LITERACY OF ADULTS ATTENDING OUTPATIENT ALLIED HEALTH SERVICES IN WESTERN SYDNEY, A HIGHLY DIVERSE REGION IN SYDNEY WITH RESIDENTS FROM A RANGE OF CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC BACKGROUNDS. METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY WAS UNDERTAKEN BETWEEN MARCH AND APRIL 2017 USING THE HEALTH LITERACY QUESTIONNAIRE (HLQ). PARTICIPANTS, AGED OVER 18YEARS AND WITH A PRIMARY LANGUAGE OF ENGLISH, ARABIC, CHINESE OR HINDI, WERE RECRUITED FROM OUTPATIENT ALLIED HEALTH CLINICS AT WESTMEAD HOSPITAL. MEANS (STANDARD DEVIATION) FOR EACH OF THE NINE HLQ DOMAINS WERE CALCULATED AND ASSOCIATIONS WITH DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES WERE INVESTIGATED USING ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA). RESULTS: TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY PEOPLE WERE INCLUDED WITH MEAN AGE OF 45.1YEARS (SD=19.0), THE MAJORITY WERE FEMALE (75.5%), OVER HALF WERE BORN OVERSEAS (55.7%) AND 77.6% REPORTED SPEAKING ENGLISH AT HOME. THE HIGHEST MEAN SCORE ON A HLQ DOMAIN (OUT OF 5) WAS \"UNDERSTANDING HEALTH INFORMATION WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT TO DO\" (M=4.19; SD=0.67), AND THE LOWEST MEAN SCORE (OUT OF 4) WAS \"APPRAISAL OF HEALTH INFORMATION\" (M=2.97; SD=0.54).

HOWEVER, TOOLS ASSESSING HEALTH LITERACY IN PRACTICE ARE LACKING. THE CONVERSATIONAL HEALTH LITERACY ASSESSMENT TOOL (CHAT) WAS RECENTLY DEVELOPED, BUT ITS ABILITY TO ASSESS HEALTH LITERACY REMAINS UNEXPLORED. WE AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPLEMENTATION AND ADOPTION OF CHAT, ITS ABILITY TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF HEALTH LITERACY AMONG HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS, AND IF CHAT COULD ASSESS HEALTH LITERACY NEEDS IN PATIENTS. METHODS: WE PERFORMED A QUALITATIVE FEASIBILITY STUDY OF CHAT AMONG HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS (NURSES, PHYSIOTHERAPISTS AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS) WHO PROVIDE REHABILITATION SERVICES FOR PATIENTS WITH NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN A MUNICIPAL HEALTHCARE CENTRE IN DENMARK. THE STUDY USED THE RE-AIM FRAMEWORK (REACH, EFFECTIVENESS, ADOPTION, IMPLEMENTATION AND MAINTENANCE) TO STRUCTURE INTERVIEW GUIDE AND ANALYSIS. WE COLLECTED QUALITATIVE DATA FROM FOUR SMALL FOCUS GROUPS WITH HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS (N=11). THE DATA WERE ANALYSED USING A DEDUCTIVE THEMATIC THREE-STEP METHOD FOR ORGANISING AND INTERPRETING DATA. ALL INFORMANTS PROVIDED WRITTEN INFORMED CONSENT PRIOR TO DATA COLLECTION. RESULTS: CHAT SEEMS TO BE A FEASIBLE AND EFFICIENT TOOL FOR ASSESSING HEALTH LITERACY NEEDS AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH DIFFERENT SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS AND WITH DIFFERENT DIAGNOSES. CHAT WAS EASIEST IMPLEMENTED AND ADOPTED BY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS, WHO WERE ALREADY FAMILIARLY WITH THE CONCEPT OF HEALTH LITERACY.

ALTHOUGH MUCH COMMUNICATION RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE HEALTHCARE TEAM, THERE IS LITTLE FOCUS ON COMMUNICATION WITH PATIENTS AND FAMILIES. IT IS NOT KNOWN WHAT DEFICITS IN HEALTH LITERATE PATIENT COMMUNICATION LEAD TO PATIENT SAFETY EVENTS. WE AIMED TO IDENTIFY THEMES OF HEALTH LITERACY-RELATED SAFETY EVENTS TO DESCRIBE THE IMPACT OF HEALTH LITERATE COMMUNICATION ON PATIENT SAFETY. METHODS: THE SAFETY EVENTS WERE ENTERED INTO A SYSTEM-WIDE SELF-REPORTED SAFETY EVENT COLLECTION DATABASE. A PATIENT SAFETY SPECIALIST TRAINED IN HEALTH LITERACY PROSPECTIVELY TAGGED EVENTS FOR HEALTH LITERACY. THE AUTHORS RETROSPECTIVELY QUERIED THE DATABASE FOR ALL HEALTH LITERACY TAGGED EVENTS DURING 9 MONTHS (SEPTEMBER 2017-MAY 2018). THE AUTHORS REVIEWED AND INDEPENDENTLY CODED HEALTH LITERACY-ASSOCIATED SAFETY EVENTS. QUALITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS OF EVENTS FACILITATED BY SOFTWARE (NVIVO) WAS COMPLETED TO IDENTIFY THE HEALTH LITERACY-RELATED SAFETY EVENT THEMES. RESULTS: HEALTH LITERACY EVENTS COMPRISED 4% (152/3911) OF SELF-REPORTED SAFETY EVENTS DURING THE 9 MONTHS. MAIN THEMES OF THE HEALTH LITERACY SAFETY EVENTS RELATED TO (1) MEDICATION; (2) SYSTEM PROCESSES; AND (3) DISCHARGE/TRANSITION. SUBTHEMES OF EACH OF THE EVENTS FURTHER DESCRIBED THE EVENT TYPES. HEALTH LITERACY-ASSOCIATED SAFETY EVENTS ENCOMPASS ALL SAFETY EVENT OUTCOMES (NEAR MISS, PRECURSOR, AND SERIOUS SAFETY EVENTS). CONCLUSIONS: HEALTH LITERACY-RELATED SAFETY EVENTS OCCUR IN THE HEALTHCARE ENVIRONMENT. THIS REVIEW CHARACTERIZING HEALTH LITERACY-RELATED SAFETY EVENTS PRIORITIZES AREAS TO IMPLEMENT HEALTH LITERATE SAFETY PRACTICES. MANY OPPORTUNITIES EXIST TO ADDRESS COMMUNICATION-RELATED SAFETY EVENTS AROUND MEDICATION, SYSTEM PROCESSES, AND DISCHARGE USING HEALTH LITERATE BEST PRACTICES.","SECTION OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE, DEPARTMENT OF PEDIATRICS, MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN, MILWAUKEE, WIS.; CHILDREN'S WISCONSIN QUALITY DEPARTMENT, MILWAUKEE, WIS.; CHILDREN'S WISCONSIN QUALITY DEPARTMENT, MILWAUKEE, WIS.; CHILDREN'S WISCONSIN, CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, MILWAUKEE, WIS.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT 2021 THE AUTHOR(S).

HEALTH LITERACY IS ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTH OUTCOMES AND HEALTH SYSTEM COSTS AND INFLUENCES THE WAY IN WHICH COMMUNICATION IS MANAGED IN THE HEALTH SYSTEM. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE LEVEL OF HEALTH LITERACY OF SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE COMMUNITY, THEIR AWARENESS OF HEALTH LITERACY, THEIR ATTITUDES TOWARD HEALTH LITERACY PROMOTION, AND THE WAY IN WHICH THEY COMMUNICATE WITH PATIENTS WITH LOW HEALTH LITERACY. METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYTIC STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AMONG 50 PHYSICIANS AND 50 ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF MEMBERS IN COMMUNITY CLINICS OF THE MACCABI HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION IN ISRAEL. KEY RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE ASSOCIATIONS WERE FOUND (P < .05) BETWEEN THE LEVEL OF HEALTH LITERACY, THE ATTITUDES TOWARD HEALTH LITERACY PROMOTION, AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH SPECIAL COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUES WERE USED WHEN TREATING PATIENTS WITH LOW HEALTH LITERACY. SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATIONS WERE FOUND (P < .01) BETWEEN THE LEVEL OF AWARENESS, AS WELL AS THE ATTITUDES TOWARD HEALTH LITERACY PROMOTION AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUES WERE APPLIED.

HEALTH LITERACY HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH PAIN INTENSITY AND PAIN CONTROL. HOWEVER, THERE IS A PAUCITY OF EVIDENCE REGARDING THIS ASSOCIATION. IN THE FIELD OF LOW BACK PAIN RESEARCH, INCONSISTENT REPORTING OF OUTCOMES HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE A CORE OUTCOME SET HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. OBJECTIVES: THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS SCOPING REVIEW WERE: (1) THE HEALTH LITERACY MEASURES CURRENTLY EMPLOYED FOR LOW BACK PAIN AND THE ASPECTS OF HEALTH LITERACY THEY INCLUDE. (2) THE LOW BACK PAIN HEALTH OUTCOMES INCLUDED IN SUCH WORK. (3) THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE HEALTH OUTCOMES REFLECT THE CORE OUTCOME SET FOR CLINICAL TRIALS IN NON-SPECIFIC LOW BACK PAIN. METHODS: THE SEARCH INCLUDED THIRTEEN BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATABASES, USING MEDICAL SUBJECT HEADING TERMS FOR LOW BACK PAIN AND HEALTH LITERACY, AND FOLLOWED THE PREFERRED REPORTING ITEMS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSES EXTENSION FOR SCOPING REVIEWS GUIDELINES. THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA WERE DEFINED BY THE JOANNA BRIGGS INSTITUTE PCC MNEMONIC. A THEMATIC FRAMEWORK APPROACH WAS USED FOR ANALYSIS. RESULTS: THE SEARCH YIELDED TEN RELEVANT STUDIES FOR INCLUSION, AMONGST WHICH A TOTAL OF NINE HEALTH LITERACY MEASURES AND 50 HEALTH OUTCOME MEASURES WERE USED. MOST HEALTH LITERACY MEASURES FOCUSED ON FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY, WITH FEW ASSESSING COMMUNICATIVE AND CRITICAL HEALTH LITERACY. THE HEALTH OUTCOMES ASSESSED BY THE INCLUDED STUDIES COULD BE BROADLY CATEGORISED INTO: PAIN, DISABILITY, BEHAVIOUR, KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEFS, AND RESOURCE UTILISATION. MOST OF THESE OUTCOME MEASURES STUDIED (36 OUT OF 50) DID NOT DIRECTLY REFLECT THE CORE OUTCOME SET FOR CLINICAL TRIALS IN NON-SPECIFIC LOW BACK PAIN. CONCLUSIONS: TO ALLOW FOR COMPARISON ACROSS FINDINGS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A RIGOROUS EVIDENCE BASE, FUTURE WORK SHOULD INCLUDE THE CORE OUTCOME SET FOR CLINICAL TRIALS IN NON-SPECIFIC LOW BACK PAIN. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO BROADEN THE EVIDENCE-BASE TO INCLUDE REGIONS WHERE LOW BACK PAIN MORBIDITY IS HIGH, BUT DATA IS LACKING. SUCH WORK DEMANDS THE INCORPORATION OF COMPREHENSIVE MEASURES OF HEALTH LITERACY THAT HAVE BOTH GENERIC AND CULTURALLY SENSITIVE COMPONENTS.","LEE KONG CHIAN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, NANYANG TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY, SINGAPORE, SINGAPORE.; CLARENCESEE@GMAIL.;COM.; LEE KONG CHIAN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, NANYANG TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY, SINGAPORE, SINGAPORE.; LEE KONG CHIAN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, NANYANG TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY, SINGAPORE, SINGAPORE.; SCHOOL OF PRIMARY, COMMUNITY AND SOCIAL CARE, KEELE UNIVERSITY, NEWCASTLE, UK.; LEE KONG CHIAN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, NANYANG TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY, SINGAPORE, SINGAPORE.; LEE KONG CHIAN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, NANYANG TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY, SINGAPORE, SINGAPORE.; SCHOOL OF PRIMARY, COMMUNITY AND SOCIAL CARE, KEELE UNIVERSITY, NEWCASTLE, UK.;","ORCID: 0000-0003-1757-883X"," 2021.

METHODS: FROM FEBRUARY TO JULY 2019, A CLUSTER RANDOM SAMPLING METHOD WAS ADOPTED TO SELECT ENTERPRISE EMPLOYEES IN SHIHEZI CITY TO CONDUCT A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY. SELF-MADE QUESTIONNAIRES AND \"NATIONAL RESIDENT HEALTH LITERACY MONITORING QUESTIONNAIRE\" WERE USED TO ASSESS THE SOCIAL DEMOGRAPHICS, HEALTH LITERACY, AND HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIORS WERE INVESTIGATED, AND 1053 VALID QUESTIONNAIRES WERE COLLECTED. LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL WAS USED TO ANALYZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND THE THREE DIMENSIONS WITH SMOKING, DRINKING, DIET AND EXERCISE. RESULTS: TOTAL SCORE OF HEALTH LITERACY OF ENTERPRISE EMPLOYEES IS (42.0611.03) POINTS AND THE EMPLOYEE HEALTH LITERACY RATE OF SHIHEZI CITY IN 2019 IS 19.47%. UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT NON-SMOKERS HAD HIGHER HEALTH LITERACY AND THREE-DIMENSIONAL HEALTH LITERACY AVAILABILITY THAN SMOKERS (P<0.01) ; FEWER DRINKERS HAD HIGHER HEALTH LITERACY AVAILABILITY THAN OVERDRINKERS (P<0.05) ; BALANCED DIET HEALTH LITERACY AVAILABILITY THE HEALTH LITERACY AVAILABILITY RATES IN THE THREE DIMENSIONS WERE HIGHER THAN THOSE IN THE UNBALANCED DIET (P<0.01) .

HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED HOW HEALTH LITERACY DETERMINES ONLINE HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIOR. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE CURRENT LEVEL OF HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION-SEEKING USING THE INTERNET AND HOW HEALTH LITERACY, ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY, AND SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS IMPACT HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION-SEEKING BEHAVIOR. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY THROUGH A SURVEY WITH MINNESOTAN ADULTS (N=614) TO EXAMINE THEIR HEALTH LITERACY, ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY, AND HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION-SEEKING INTERNET USE. WE USED MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION ANALYSIS TO ASSESS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION-SEEKING ON THE INTERNET AND HEALTH LITERACY AND ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY, CONTROLLING FOR SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS. RESULTS: BETTER HEALTH LITERACY (=.35, SE 0.12) AND GREATER ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGICAL DEVICES (EG, MOBILE PHONE AND COMPUTER OR TABLET PC; =.06, SE 0.19) WERE BOTH ASSOCIATED WITH MORE HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION-SEEKING BEHAVIOR ON THE INTERNET AFTER ADJUSTING FOR ALL OTHER SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS.

CONSEQUENTLY, WE TEST IF ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND HEALTH OUTCOMES ARE STRONGER AMONG YOUNG MALE ADULTS WHO SCORE HIGH IN CONVERSION FACTORS COMPARED TO THOSE WHO SCORE LOW. CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA FROM THE YOUNG ADULT SURVEY SWITZERLAND WERE USED FOR THE ANALYSES (N=9339, AGE = 18-25). MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSES WERE APPLIED TO ESTIMATE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND HEALTH. MODERATOR ANALYSES WITH THREE CONVERSION FACTORS AND FIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES WERE CONDUCTED. FOR EACH HEALTH OUTCOME AT LEAST ONE CONVERSION FACTOR MODERATED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND HEALTH ACCORDING TO THE HYPOTHESIS. ALTHOUGH STRENGTH AND FORM OF THE MODERATION EFFECT DIFFER ACROSS ANALYSES, GENERALLY STRONGER ASSOCIATIONS WERE FOUND AMONG GROUPS WITH BENEFICIAL SOCIAL OR PERSONAL FACTORS. THE PRESENT FINDINGS SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT CONVERSION FACTORS PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND HEALTH. THE FINDINGS, THUS, POINT TOWARDS A POTENTIAL RISK OF LINEAR HEALTH LITERACY APPROACHES THAT ASSUME EQUAL BENEFITS FROM INCREASED HEALTH LITERACY.

THE PURPOSE OF STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY, SOCIAL SUPPORT AND SELF-EFFICACY OF MOTHERS OF PRETERM NEONATES ADMITTED TO THE NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT. METHODS: THIS DESCRIPTIVE CORRELATIONAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED FROM NOVEMBER 2017 TO JANUARY 2019 ON 200 MOTHERS OF PRETERM NEONATES ADMITTED TO THE NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT OF SELECTED HOSPITALS AFFILIATED WITH IRAN UNIVERSITY OF MEDICAL SCIENCES, TEHRAN, IRAN. DATA WERE COLLECTED USING DEMOGRAPHIC, MATERNAL HEALTH LITERACY, MATERNAL SELF-EFFICACY AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALE OF PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT QUESTIONNAIRES. DATA WERE ANALYZED BY DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS (MEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATION) AND INFERENTIAL TESTS (PEARSON CORRELATION COEFFICIENT) USING SPSS-PC (V.23) AND R SOFTWARE. RESULTS: THE DATA SHOWED 23.5% OF MOTHERS HAD HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF LOW HEALTH LITERACY, 45.5% HAD POSSIBILITY OF LOW HEALTH LITERACY AND 31% HAD ADEQUATE WITH MEAN SCORE 2.571.28. ALSO, 9.5% OF PARTICIPANTS HAD LOW PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT, 62.5% MODERATE PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT AND 28% HIGH PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT. MATERNAL SELF-EFFICACY SCORE WAS 52.548.06. PEARSON'S CORRELATION COEFFICIENT ANALYSES REVEALED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN MATERNAL HEALTH LITERACY AND SOCIAL SUPPORT (R=0.304, P<.001). ALSO MATERNAL HEALTH LITERACY WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE SELF-EFFICACY (R=0.292, P<.001) AND SELF-EFFICACY WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH SOCIAL SUPPORT (R=0.440, P<.001). CONCLUSION: HEALTH LITERACY, SOCIAL SUPPORT AND SELF-EFFICACY OF MOTHERS OF PRETERM NEONATES ADMITTED TO THE NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT IN IRAN ARE RELATED TOGETHER.

A POPULATION-BASED, CROSS-SECTIONAL OBSERVATIONAL STUDY ENROLLING 1,728 STUDENTS (795 BOYS), AGED 10 TO 12 YEARS OLD, WAS CONDUCTED DURING SCHOOL YEARS 2014-2016. A HEALTH LITERACY INDEX (RANGE 0-100) WAS CREATED THROUGH AN ITEM RESPONSE THEORY HYBRID MODEL, BY COMBINING A VARIETY OF BELIEFS AND PERCEPTIONS OF CHILDREN ABOUT HEALTH. THE MEAN HEALTH LITERACY SCORE WAS 70.4 (18.7). THE MAJORITY OF CHILDREN (63.8%) HAD A \"HIGH\" LEVEL (I.E., >67/100) OF HEALTH LITERACY, 30.5% HAD A \"MEDIUM\" LEVEL (I.E., 34-66/100) OF HEALTH LITERACY, WHILE A SMALL PROPORTION OF CHILDREN (5.7%) HAD A \"LOW\" LEVEL (I.E., <33/100). GIRLS EXHIBITED A HIGHER LEVEL OF HEALTH LITERACY THAN BOYS (71.7 18.3 VS. 68.8 19.1, P < .01). REGARDING BODY WEIGHT STATUS, 21.7% OF CHILDREN WAS OVERWEIGHT AND 5.0% WAS OBESE. LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS SHOWED THAT THE HEALTH LITERACY SCORE WAS INVERSELY ASSOCIATED WITH CHILDREN'S BODY MASS INDEX (REGRESSION COEFFICIENT [95% CI]: -0.010 [-0.018, -0.001]), AFTER ADJUSTING FOR DIETARY HABITS, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY LEVELS, AND OTHER POTENTIAL CONFOUNDERS.

THIS SCOPING REVIEW PRIMARILY MAPS CRITERIA CHARACTERIZING HEALTH LITERATE HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS. SECONDARY OUTCOMES ARE THE CONCEPTS AND TERMINOLOGIES UNDERLYING THESE CRITERIA AS WELL AS INSTRUMENTS TO MEASURE THEM. METHODS: THE REVIEW WAS CARRIED OUT FOLLOWING THE JBI MANUAL ON SCOPING REVIEWS. THE DATABASES CINAHL, COCHRANE LIBRARY, JSTOR, PSYCINFO, PUBMED, WEB OF SCIENCE CORE COLLECTION, AND WILEY ONLINE LIBRARY WERE SEARCHED IN JULY 2020. THREE RESEARCHERS SCREENED THE RECORDS AND EXTRACTED THE DATA. THE RESULTS WERE SYNTHESIZED SYSTEMATICALLY AND DESCRIPTIVELY. RESULTS: THE LITERATURE SEARCH RESULTED IN 639 RECORDS. AFTER REMOVING DUPLICATES, SCREENING BY TITLE AND ABSTRACT, AND ASSESSING FULL-TEXTS FOR ELIGIBILITY, THE SCOPING REVIEW INCLUDED 60 PUBLICATIONS. CRITERIA FOR OHL WERE EXTRACTED AND ASSIGNED TO SIX MAIN CATEGORIES (WITH 25 SUBCATEGORIES). THE MOST PREVALENT TOPIC OF ORGANIZATIONAL HEALTH LITERACY REFERS TO COMMUNICATION WITH SERVICE USERS. EXEMPLARY CRITERIA REGARDING THIS MAIN CATEGORY ARE THE EDUCATION AND INFORMATION OF SERVICE USERS, WORK ON EASY-TO-UNDERSTAND WRITTEN MATERIALS AS WELL AS ORAL EXCHANGE, AND VERIFYING UNDERSTANDING. THE SIX MAIN CATEGORIES WERE DEFINED AS 1) COMMUNICATION WITH SERVICE USERS; 2) EASY ACCESS & NAVIGATION; 3) INTEGRATION & PRIORITIZATION OF OHL; 4) ASSESSMENTS & ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT; 5) ENGAGEMENT & SUPPORT OF SERVICE USERS, AND 6) INFORMATION & QUALIFICATION OF STAFF. THE CRITERIA WERE BASED ON VARIOUS CONCEPTS AND TERMINOLOGIES. TERMINOLOGIES WERE CATEGORIZED INTO FOUR CONCEPTUAL CLUSTERS: 1) HEALTH LITERACY IN VARIOUS SOCIAL CONTEXTS; 2) HEALTH LITERATE HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION; 3) ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR, AND 4) COMMUNICATION IN HEALTH CARE. 17 DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT TOOLS AND INSTRUMENTS WERE IDENTIFIED. ONLY SOME OF THE TOOLKITS AND INSTRUMENTS WERE VALIDATED OR TESTED IN FEASIBILITY STUDIES. CONCLUSIONS: ORGANIZATIONAL HEALTH LITERACY INCLUDES A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF DISTINCT ORGANIZATIONAL CRITERIA.

THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN HEALTH-RELATED SKILLS AND WORK ABILITY WITHIN THE STRUCTURAL MODEL OF HEALTH LITERACY OF LENARTZ, SOELLNER AND COLLEAGUES, WHICH EXPLAINS HEALTH BEHAVIOUR AND HEALTH THROUGH THE INDIRECT AND DIRECT INFLUENCE OF SIX 'ADVANCED SKILLS' ('SELF-PERCEPTION', 'PROACTIVE APPROACH TO HEALTH', 'DEALING WITH HEALTH INFORMATION', 'SELF-CONTROL', 'SELF-REGULATION' AND 'COMMUNICATION AND COOPERATION'). THE CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS BASED ON BASELINE DATA OF A HEALTH LITERACY PROMOTION INTERVENTION (495 VOCATIONAL SCHOOL STUDENTS, 59.0% FEMALE, AGE SPAN 18-25YEARS). STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING WITH PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES WAS USED TO EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN THE SIX CONSTRUCTS OF THE MODEL AND THE WORK ABILITY INDEX (WAI).

THE DESIGN OF AND MEASURES USED BY HOSPITALS, HOWEVER, HAVE NOT YET TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHETHER PATIENTS CAN DEVELOP THEIR HEALTH LITERACY THROUGH THE PROCESS OF MEDICAL TREATMENT. HOSPITALS SHOULD TAKE ON THIS ROLE AS PART OF HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAMS. METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED AT PRE-ADMISSION TESTING CENTER PATIENTS WAITING TO BE HOSPITALIZED IN A REGIONAL TEACHING HOSPITAL. A PURPOSIVE SAMPLING METHOD WAS USED TO RECRUIT 406 PATIENTS VIA SELF-ADMINISTERED QUESTIONNAIRES. RESULTS: AMONG THE 406 PARTICIPANTS, 36.1% HAD ADEQUATE HEALTH LITERACY. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN AGE, EDUCATION ATTAINMENT, AND HISTORY OF CHRONIC DISEASES FOR HEALTH LITERACY. THE ABILITY TO FIND AND JUDGE INFORMATION ON HEALTH WAS LOWER. WATCHING HEALTH-RELATED TV PROGRAMS WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH HEALTH LITERACY. HEALTH LITERACY, HEALTH PROMOTION LITERACY, AND UNDERSTANDING INFORMATION ON HEALTH WERE POSITIVELY CORRELATED TO SELF-CARE AND MANAGEMENT. 65.8% OF PATIENTS DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE TREATMENT FOR WHICH THEY WERE BEING ADMITTED. HEALTH LITERACY, HEALTHCARE HEALTH LITERACY, THE ABILITY TO JUDGE HEALTH INFORMATION WERE POSITIVELY RELATED TO UNDERSTANDING THE TREATMENT. CONCLUSION: HEALTH LITERACY IS A CRITICAL FACILITATING FACTOR IN IMPROVING SELF-CARE AND MANAGEMENT AND UNDERSTANDING TREATMENT ON ADMISSION.

DESIGN/SETTING: QUESTIONS ABOUT HEALTH LITERACY WERE AVAILABLE FOR OPTIONAL USE IN THE 2016 BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM. WE ANALYZED 2016 BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM DATA FROM 4 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA THAT HAD INCLUDED BOTH THE HEALTH LITERACY AND DIABETES OPTIONAL MODULES. PARTICIPANTS: RESPONDENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE 2016 BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM IN ALABAMA, LOUISIANA, MISSISSIPPI, VIRGINIA, AND WASHINGTON, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, AND COMPLETED BOTH MODULES (N = 4397). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HEALTH LITERACY WAS MEASURED BY LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY (EASY, DIFFICULT) WITH 3 HEALTH LITERACY TASKS: GETTING HEALTH ADVICE OR INFORMATION, UNDERSTANDING HEALTH INFORMATION DELIVERED ORALLY BY HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, AND UNDERSTANDING WRITTEN HEALTH INFORMATION. DIABETES CARE MEASURES INCLUDED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, SELF-MONITORING BLOOD GLUCOSE, SELF-CHECKING FEET, HEMOGLOBIN A1C TESTING, PROFESSIONAL FOOT EXAMINATION, FLU VACCINATION, PROFESSIONAL EYE EXAMINATION, DENTAL VISITS, AND DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT EDUCATION. RESULTS: AMONG THOSE WITH SELF-REPORTED DIABETES, 5.9% FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET HEALTH ADVICE OR INFORMATION, 10.7% FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND INFORMATION HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TOLD THEM, AND 12.0% FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WRITTEN HEALTH INFORMATION. THOSE WHO FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET HEALTH ADVICE OR INFORMATION HAD 44% TO 56% LOWER ADJUSTED ODDS OF A1C TESTING, PROFESSIONAL FOOT EXAMINATIONS, AND DENTAL VISITS; THOSE WHO FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WRITTEN HEALTH INFORMATION HAD LOWER ODDS OF SELF-MONITORING GLUCOSE AND SELF-CHECKING FEET. DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING BOTH ORAL AND WRITTEN HEALTH INFORMATION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH NEVER HAVING TAKEN A DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT CLASS. CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT PROBLEMS WITH HEALTH LITERACY MAY BE A BARRIER TO GOOD DISEASE MANAGEMENT AMONG ADULTS WITH DIABETES AND THAT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS SHOULD BE ATTENTIVE TO THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS WITH LOW HEALTH LITERACY, ESPECIALLY FOR DIABETES-SPECIFIC SPECIALTY CARE.","DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, BRODY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, EAST CAROLINA UNIVERSITY, GREENVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT 2019 WOLTERS KLUWER HEALTH, INC.

RESULTS: OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE HEALTH LITERACY WERE WEAKLY ASSOCIATED WITH ONE ANOTHER (R=0.06, P=.24). HIGH OBJECTIVE HEALTH LITERACY LEVELS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCLINATION TO BEHAVE IN WAYS THAT ARE BENEFICIAL TO ONE'S OWN OR OTHERS' HEALTH (EXP[B]=2.068, P=.004) AND AN ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE LOW-QUALITY ONLINE SOURCES OF HEALTH INFORMATION (=-.4698, P=.005). THE RECOGNITION ALSO IMPROVED PARTICIPANTS' CHOICE OF TREATMENT (=-.3345, P<.001). OBJECTIVE HEALTH LITERACY HELPED PEOPLE TO RECOGNIZE MISINFORMATION ON HEALTH WEBSITES AND IMPROVED THEIR JUDGMENT ON THEIR TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION. CONCLUSIONS: SELF-REPORTED, PERCEPTION-BASED HEALTH LITERACY SHOULD BE TREATED AS A SEPARATE CONCEPT FROM OBJECTIVE, PERFORMANCE-BASED HEALTH LITERACY. ONLY OBJECTIVE HEALTH LITERACY APPEARS TO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM BECOMING VICTIMS OF HEALTH DISINFORMATION.","INSTITUTE OF COMMUNICATION AND HEALTH, UNIVERSIT DELLA SVIZZERA ITALIANA, LUGANO, SWITZERLAND.; INSTITUTE OF COMMUNICATION AND HEALTH, UNIVERSIT DELLA SVIZZERA ITALIANA, LUGANO, SWITZERLAND.; UNIVERSIT DELLA SVIZZERA ITALIANA, LUGANO, SWITZERLAND.; INSTITUTE OF COMMUNICATION AND HEALTH, UNIVERSIT DELLA SVIZZERA ITALIANA, LUGANO, SWITZERLAND.;","ORCID: 0000-0003-4281-489X ORCID: 0000-0002-7883-2654 ORCID: 0000-0001-7089-6277 ORCID: 0000-0002-7223-8240","PETER JOHANNES SCHULZ, ANNALISA PESSINA, UWE HARTUNG, SERENA PETROCCHI.

ANALYSES ASSESSED RACIAL DIFFERENCES IN HL AND FCC FOR PARENTS AND YOUTH USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION. RESULTS: HALF OF YOUTH AND OVER 80 PERCENT OF PARENTS HAD ADEQUATE HL (REALM SCORE 62). ADEQUATE HL WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN AFRICAN AMERICANS (AA) FOR BOTH YSHCN AND PARENTS. ONLY 57 % OF PARENTS AND 29 % OF YSHCN REPORTED FCC.

HOWEVER, MANY OBSTACLES - INCLUDING LACK OF TIME AND LIMITED RESOURCES AVAILABLE - PREVENT THE TRANSITION TOWARDS HEALTH LITERATE HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS. TWO INITIATIVES ARE REQUIRED TO OVERCOME EXTANT BARRIERS.

PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE GERMAN POPULATION HAS ONLY AN AVERAGE LEVEL OF HEALTH LITERACY. HEALTH PROFESSIONALS SUCH AS NURSES, DOCTORS OR MIDWIVES NEED TO BE HEALTH LITERATE THEMSELVES TO PROMOTE PATIENTS' HEALTH LITERACY, AS WELL AS TO PROTECT AND PROMOTE THEIR OWN HEALTH. SO FAR, THERE IS A LACK OF RESEARCH ABOUT HEALTH LITERACY AMONG HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN GERMANY. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE HEALTH LITERACY OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. METHOD: THE STUDY INVOLVED 583 PARTICIPANTS FROM THE FINAL YEAR CLASSES OF THE DHBW STUTTGART AND DUAL COOPERATION PARTNERS (VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIC TEACHING HOSPITALS). THESE INCLUDED GRADUATES OF NURSING, MIDWIFERY AND THERAPY (PHYSIOTHERAPY/LOGO-/OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY), AS WELL AS MANAGEMENT IN HEALTH CARE AND MEDICAL STUDENTS IN THEIR PRACTICAL YEAR. THE QUESTIONNAIRE HLS-EU-Q16 WAS USED TO RECORD HEALTH LITERACY. BY MEANS OF 16 QUESTIONS, THE PARTICIPANTS RATED ON A 4-POINT SCALE HOW EASY OR DIFFICULT IT WAS FOR THEM TO FIND, UNDERSTAND, ASSESS AND IMPLEMENT HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION. RESULTS: THE STUDY SHOWED THAT ONLY 30.1% OF THE PARTICIPANTS HAD SUFFICIENT HEALTH LITERACY; 48.9% OF THE PARTICIPANTS SHOWED PROBLEMATIC HEALTH LITERACY, 21.0% INADEQUATE HEALTH LITERACY. THE ANALYSIS OF THE INDIVIDUAL QUESTIONS SHOWED THAT, IN ALMOST ALL AREAS, PATICIPANTS REPORTED MORE PROBLEMS IN FINDING, UNDERSTANDING, ASSESSING AND IMPLEMENTING HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION THAN RESPONDENTS IN OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. CONCLUSIONS: THE PRESENT STUDY SHOWS THAT YOUNG HEALTH PROFESSIONALS HAVE LIMITED HEALTH LITERACY. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO OBTAIN A MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND DIFFERENTIATED PICTURE OF HEALTH LITERACY AMONG HEALTH PROFESSIONALS.

OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE HEALTH LITERACY LEVELS IN TURKEY AND TO INVESTIGATE THE ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH LITERACY WITH SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS AS WELL AS WITH THE INSTRUMENTS USED AS SOURCES OF HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION. METHODS: THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL, NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED USING A COMPUTER-ASSISTED PERSONAL INTERVIEW APPROACH AND INCLUDED 6,228 HOUSEHOLDS (RESPONSE RATE, 70.9%). THE TURKEY HEALTH LITERACY SCALE WAS USED TO MEASURE HEALTH LITERACY. SOURCES OF HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION, SUCH AS NEWSPAPERS, TELEVISION, INTERNET, AND SMARTPHONES, WERE INCLUDED IN THE REGRESSION MODEL FOR HEALTH LITERACY. KEY RESULTS: THE PROPORTION OF PARTICIPANTS WITH INADEQUATE AND PROBLEMATIC HEALTH LITERACY WAS 30.9% AND 38%, RESPECTIVELY, SHOWING THAT APPROXIMATELY 7 OF 10 PARTICIPANTS HAD LIMITED HEALTH LITERACY. THE FREQUENCIES OF INADEQUATE AND PROBLEMATIC HEALTH LITERACY WERE HIGHER IN THE DISEASE PREVENTION AND PROMOTION DOMAINS (37.4% AND 34.2%, RESPECTIVELY) COMPARED WITH THOSE IN THE HEALTH CARE DOMAIN (27.1% AND 31.3%, RESPECTIVELY). THE MOST FREQUENTLY USED MEDIUM AS A SOURCE OF HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION WAS THE INTERNET (48.6%), FOLLOWED BY TELEVISION (33%). IN CONTROLLED MODELS, HIGHER HEALTH LITERACY SCORES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER EDUCATION AND INCOME LEVELS. THE EFFECTS OF TELEVISION ( = 1,917), INTERNET ( = 2,803), NEWSPAPERS ( = 1,489), AND SMARTPHONES ( = 1,974) AS SOURCES OF HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN THE GENERAL HEALTH LITERACY INDEX MODEL. CONCLUSIONS: HEALTH LITERACY IN TURKEY REFLECTS SOCIAL INEQUALITIES. THE MODEL ACCOUNTING FOR SOCIOECONOMIC VARIABLES DEMONSTRATED THE RELEVANCE OF SOURCES OF HEALTH INFORMATION TO LEVEL OF HEALTH LITERACY.

TO INFORM AND DEVELOP PROMISING HEALTH PROMOTION FOR PEOPLE IN NEED, WE ANALYSED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY, QUALITY OF LIFE AND SPIRITUAL AND RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. METHODS: IN THIS FIRST STUDY ON HEALTH LITERACY IN AFGHANISTAN, WE INTERVIEWED 522 MEN AND 324 WOMEN IN THE GHAZNI PROVINCE. BESIDES THE HLS-EU-16, WE USED QUALITY OF LIFE (WHO-QOL-BREF) AND THE WHO-SRPB-BREF QUESTIONNAIRES IN DARI AND PASHTO. WE PERFORMED DESCRIPTIVE, UNI- AND MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES. RESULTS: THE LEVELS OF HL, QOL AND SRPB_COPING ARE COMPARATIVELY LOW AMONG AFGHAN MEN FROM THE GHAZNI PROVINCE, BUT HIGHER AMONG WOMEN ON ALL SCALES.

SCHOOLS CAN BE SEEN AS AN IDEAL VENUE FOR STRENGTHENING HEALTH LITERACY BECAUSE THEY REACH ALMOST ALL SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN THROUGHOUT THEIR SCHOOL YEARS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF HEALTH LITERACY AT A YOUNG AGE IS A CATALYST FOR HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT THROUGHOUT ACROSS THE LIFE SPAN. EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT HEALTH AND EDUCATION ARE INTERTWINED WITH FAVORABLE EFFECTS FOR HEALTH (E.G., HEALTH BEHAVIOR, KNOWLEDGE) AND EDUCATION OUTCOMES (E.G., ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT). HOWEVER, HEALTH LITERACY IS OFTEN NOT SUFFICIENTLY INTEGRATED INTO THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM DESPITE ITS IMPORTANCE TO HEALTH AND EDUCATION. INTEGRATING HEALTH LITERACY INTO SCHOOLS IS CHALLENGING, AS BOTH SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS ALREADY FACE NUMEROUS EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS THAT MAY PREVENT THEM FROM ADDRESSING HEALTH IN THE CLASSROOM BECAUSE THEY PERCEIVE IT AS AN ADDITIONAL TASK. THIS IS WHY TAKING A SENSITIVE APPROACH IS IMPORTANT, ADAPTED TO THE NEEDS OF SCHOOLS AND HIGHLIGHTING THE BENEFITS OF HEALTH LITERACY. INSTALLING HEALTH LITERACY IN SCHOOLS SUCCEEDS MORE EASILY IF IT CAN BE LINKED TO EXISTING CURRICULAR REQUIREMENTS. IN THIS CONTEXT, CURRICULUM AND INSTRUCTION ON MEDIA LITERACY, INFORMATION LITERACY, AND DIGITAL LITERACY ARE MOST PROMISING SUBJECTS TO INCLUDE HEALTH LITERACY BECAUSE THESE CONCEPTS SHARE MANY COMMONALITIES WITH HEALTH LITERACY AND OFTEN ARE ALREADY PART OF THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM. THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO (1) ANALYZE A MANDATORY CURRICULUM ON MEDIA LITERACY IN THE STATE OF NORTH-RHINE-WESTPHALIA IN GERMANY, (2) HIGHLIGHT ITS INTERSECTIONS WITH HEALTH LITERACY, AND (3) SHOW HOW IT CAN BE USED TO ADDRESS HEALTH LITERACY. THE STATE MEDIA LITERACY FRAMEWORK IS BASED ON THE FEDERAL STANDARDS FOR \"DIGITAL EDUCATION\" DEVELOPED BY THE GERMAN CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION MINISTRIES UND CULTURAL AFFAIRS (KMK). AS EDUCATION POLICY AND PRACTICE IS DECENTRALIZED WITH SIXTEEN FEDERAL STATES IN GERMANY, EACH OF THEM HAS GOT THEIR OWN MEDIA LITERACY FRAMEWORK, OR THEY ARE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING IT. THIS CURRICULUM ANALYSIS MAY SERVE AS A METHODOLOGICAL BLUEPRINT FOR EDUCATIONALISTS, TEACHERS, AND POLICY-MAKER ELSEWHERE IN ORDER TO INCLUDE HEALTH LITERACY INTO EXISTING CURRICULA BOTH HEALTH AND NON-HEALTH.

HOWEVER, THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND OUTCOMES AMONG CHINESE RESIDENTS HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED USING NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE DATA. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND SELF-RATED HEALTH AMONG CHINESE RESIDENTS BASED ON THE 2017 CHINA HEALTH LITERACY SURVEY. METHODS: THE 2017 CHINA HEALTH LITERACY SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED AMONG NON-INSTITUTIONALIZED RESIDENTS AGED 15-69 YEARS FROM 31 PROVINCES IN CHINA. SELF-RATED HEALTH WAS MEASURED USING A SINGLE QUESTION WITH A 1-5 SCALE. HEALTH LITERACY WAS ASSESSED USING THE CHINESE HEALTH LITERACY SCALE. MULTILEVEL LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS EXAMINED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND SELF-RATED HEALTH. DATA WERE COLLECTED IN 2017 AND ANALYZED BETWEEN 2018 AND 2019. RESULTS: THE FINAL SAMPLE SIZE WAS 85,384. THE OVERALL WEIGHTED MEAN OF THE SELF-RATED HEALTH SCORE WAS 4.02 (95% CI=4.00, 4.03). AFTER ADJUSTING FOR INDIVIDUAL-, COUNTY-, AND PROVINCE-LEVEL COVARIATES, CHINESE RESIDENTS WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF HEALTH LITERACY WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE BETTER SELF-RATED HEALTH (=0.0007, SE=0.0002, P<0.001).

IT IS POSTULATED THAT ONE INFLUENCING FACTOR OF HEALTH LITERACY IN ADOLESCENTS WITH SCD IS HEALTH-SEEKING BEHAVIOR. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TWOFOLD: (1) TO EXPLORE HEALTH-SEEKING BEHAVIORS OF ADOLESCENTS WITH SCD AND (2) TO DETERMINE IF THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN HEALTH LITERACY LEVELS OF ADOLESCENTS WITH SCD BASED UPON HEALTH-SEEKING BEHAVIORS. METHODS: THIS WAS A CROSS-SECTIONAL, DESCRIPTIVE STUDY EVALUATING HEALTH-SEEKING BEHAVIORS AND HEALTH LITERACY IN 110 BLACK AND NON-HISPANIC ADOLESCENTS WITH SCD. CONVENIENCE SAMPLING WAS UTILIZED FOR RECRUITMENT. THE INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE A DIAGNOSIS OF ONE OF THE FOUR PRIMARY GENOTYPES OF SCD AND AGE OF 10-19YEARS. HEALTH LITERACY WAS EVALUATED USING THE NEWEST VITAL SIGN (NVS). FREQUENCIES AND PERCENTAGES WERE CALCULATED FOR ALL VARIABLES. INDEPENDENT SAMPLES T-TESTS WERE CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE DIFFERENCES IN HEALTH LITERACY SCORES BASED UPON DIFFERING HEALTH-SEEKING BEHAVIORS. RESULTS: THE MEAN AGE OF PARTICIPANTS WAS 14.8YEARS (SD=2.2). THE MEAN NVS SCORE WAS 2.7 (SD=1.6). THE TWO MOST COMMON RESPONSES TO \"WHERE DO YOU GO FIRST FOR HEALTH INFORMATION?\" WERE THE INTERNET (29.6%; N=40) AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS (27.4%; N=37). THERE WAS NO STATISTICAL DIFFERENCE IN NVS SCORES BETWEEN ADOLESCENTS USING THE INTERNET VERSUS HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AS THEIR FIRST SOURCE OF HEALTH INFORMATION (T[75]=-.12; P=.22). DISCUSSION: KNOWLEDGE OF HEALTH-SEEKING BEHAVIORS AND HEALTH LITERACY IN ADOLESCENTS WITH SCD GIVES INSIGHT INTO THE DESIGN AND EVALUATION OF FUTURE INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND HEALTH LITERACY IN THIS POPULATION.","LOUISE HERRINGTON SCHOOL OF NURSING, BAYLOR UNIVERSITY, DALLAS, TX, USA.; LOUISE HERRINGTON SCHOOL OF NURSING, BAYLOR UNIVERSITY, DALLAS, TX, USA.;","ORCID: 0000-0002-7134-077X",NA,NA,NA,"2021/05/07 12:23","20211027","20210507",2021,"2021/05/08 06:00",NA,NA,"5","1532-8457 (ELECTRONIC) 1043-4542 (LINKING)","8917825","JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY NURSING : OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION OF PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY NURSES","ENG","10.1177/10434542211011045 [DOI]","20211027","2021/10/28 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","307-312","UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"33960864","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"J PEDIATR ONCOL NURS. 2021 SEP-OCT;38(5):307-312.

OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE CANCER HEALTH LITERACY AND PATIENT ACTIVATION IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER AS WELL AS EXAMINE THEIR RELATIONSHIPS TO HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) AND RESOURCE USE. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER POSITIVE FOR HUMAN EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR 2 (HER2+) RECEIVING CARE AT 12 ONCOLOGY CLINICS IN TEXAS WERE OFFERED PARTICIPATION IN THE STUDY VIA CONVENIENCE SAMPLING. THE SURVEY CONSISTED OF THE 6-ITEM CANCER HEALTH LITERACY TOOL, THE 13-ITEM PATIENT ACTIVATION MEASURE, THE 27-ITEM FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPY - GENERAL (VERSION 4), AND SINGLE-ITEM MEASURES FOR NUMBER OF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS AS WELL AS CLINICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS. KEY RESULTS: THE MEAN AGE OF THE 146 STUDY PARTICIPANTS WAS 57.1 10.8 YEARS; 92% (N = 134) HAD A HIGH PROBABILITY (0.7) OF ADEQUATE CANCER HEALTH LITERACY WHEREAS 68% PERCENT (N = 99) HAD HIGH PATIENT ACTIVATION (LEVEL 3 OR 4).

PATIENT INFORMATION FOR PEOPLE WITH CKD, INCLUDING THOSE WITH KIDNEY FAILURE REQUIRING DIALYSIS, IS OFTEN WRITTEN BEYOND THEIR LITERACY LEVEL, AND MANY CKD-RELATED APPS ARE NOT ACCURATE OR EVIDENCE BASED. THESE REPRESENT IMPORTANT BARRIERS TO HEALTH CARE DECISION-MAKING AND EQUITY IN ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. METHODS: WE DEVELOPED A CROSS-PLATFORM APPLICATION (THE \"SUCCESS APP\") TO SUPPORT AUSTRALIAN ADULTS WITH KIDNEY FAILURE REQUIRING DIALYSIS TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN SELF-MANAGEMENT AND DECISION-MAKING. APP CONTENT WAS INFORMED BY HEALTH LITERACY THEORY WHICH RECOGNISES THE IMPORTANCE OF REDUCING THE COMPLEXITY OF HEALTH INFORMATION AS WELL AS EQUIPPING CONSUMERS WITH THE SKILLS NECESSARY TO ACCESS, UNDERSTAND AND ACT ON THIS INFORMATION. THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM COMPRISED MEMBERS OF DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS AND EXPERTISE, INCLUDING NURSING, ALLIED HEALTH, PSYCHOLOGY, EPIDEMIOLOGY, NEPHROLOGY AND IT, AS WELL AS CONSUMER REPRESENTATIVES. RESULTS: CONTENT AREAS INCLUDED DIET, FLUIDS, MEDICINE, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING AND SUPPORTIVE CARE, CHOSEN AS THEY REPRESENT IMPORTANT DECISION POINTS IN THE CKD TRAJECTORY. TO SUPPORT FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY, A FOUR-STEP PROCESS TO SIMPLIFY WRITTEN CONTENT WAS USED INCLUDING CALCULATING READABILITY STATISTICS, APPLYING THE PATIENT EDUCATION MATERIALS ASSESSMENT TOOL, SUPPLEMENTING WRITTEN INFORMATION WITH VIDEO AND AUDIO CONTENT, AND INCORPORATING MICRO-LEARNING AND INTERACTIVE QUIZZES. TO DEVELOP COMMUNICATIVE AND CRITICAL HEALTH LITERACY SKILLS, QUESTION PROMPT LISTS AND EVIDENCE-BASED VOLITIONAL HELP SHEETS WERE INCLUDED IN EACH MODULE TO SUPPORT QUESTION-ASKING AND BEHAVIOUR CHANGE. WE ALSO DEVELOPED ANIMATED SKILLS TRAINING RELATED TO COMMUNICATION, SHARED DECISION-MAKING AND CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF HEALTH INFORMATION. CONCLUSIONS: THIS IS THE FIRST HEALTH LITERACY INFORMED APP DEVELOPED TO PROMOTE ACTIVE PATIENT PARTICIPATION IN CKD MANAGEMENT AND DECISION-MAKING. ONGOING EVALUATION OF THE SUCCESS APP THROUGH ANALYSIS OF QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA WILL PROVIDE VALUABLE INSIGHTS INTO THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING THE APP WITH DIALYSIS PATIENTS, AND THE IMPACT OF THE INTERVENTION OF PSYCHOSOCIAL AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES.

OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MATERNAL HEALTH LITERACY AND MATERNAL AND NEONATAL OUTCOMES AMONG NULLIPAROUS INDIVIDUALS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: THIS WAS A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF A LARGE, MULTICENTER COHORT STUDY OF 10038 NULLIPAROUS INDIVIDUALS IN THE US (2010-2013). PARTICIPANTS UNDERWENT 3 ANTENATAL STUDY VISITS AND HAD DETAILED MATERNAL AND NEONATAL DATA ABSTRACTED. DATA ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED FROM JULY TO DECEMBER 2019. EXPOSURES: BETWEEN 16 AND 21 WEEKS OF GESTATION, HEALTH LITERACY WAS ASSESSED USING THE RAPID ESTIMATE OF ADULT LITERACY IN MEDICINE-SHORT FORM, A VALIDATED 7-ITEM WORD RECOGNITION TEST. IN ACCORDANCE WITH STANDARD SCORING, RESULTS WERE DICHOTOMIZED AS INADEQUATE VS ADEQUATE HEALTH LITERACY. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: ON THE BASIS OF THEORETICAL CAUSAL PATHWAYS BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND HEALTH OUTCOMES, A PRIORI MATERNAL AND NEONATAL OUTCOMES (DETERMINED VIA MEDICAL RECORDS) WERE SELECTED FOR THIS ANALYSIS. MULTIVARIABLE POISSON REGRESSION MODELS WERE CONSTRUCTED TO ESTIMATE THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND OUTCOMES. SENSITIVITY ANALYSES IN WHICH EDUCATION WAS REMOVED FROM MODELS AND THAT EXCLUDED INDIVIDUALS WHO SPOKE ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE WERE PERFORMED. RESULTS: OF 9341 PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED THE RAPID ESTIMATE OF ADULT LITERACY IN MEDICINE-SHORT FORM, THE MEAN (SD) AGE WAS 27.0 (5.6) YEARS, AND 2540 (27.4%) HAD PUBLICLY FUNDED PRENATAL CARE. OVERALL, 1638 PARTICIPANTS (17.5%) HAD SCORES INDICATIVE OF INADEQUATE HEALTH LITERACY. PARTICIPANTS WITH INADEQUATE HEALTH LITERACY WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE YOUNGER (MEAN [SD] AGE, 22.9 [5.0] VS 27.9 [5.3] YEARS), HAVE LESS EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT (SOME COLLEGE EDUCATION OR GREATER, 1149 PARTICIPANTS [73.9%] VS 5279 PARTICIPANTS [94.5%]), HAVE PUBLICLY FUNDED INSURANCE (1008 PARTICIPANTS [62.2%] VS 1532 PARTICIPANTS [20.0%]), AND REPORT THEY WERE A MEMBER OF AN UNDERREPRESENTED RACIAL OR ETHNIC GROUP (NON-HISPANIC BLACK, 506 PARTICIPANTS [30.9%] VS 780 PARTICIPANTS [10.1%]; HISPANIC, 516 PARTICIPANTS [31.5%] VS 948 PARTICIPANTS [12.3%]) COMPARED WITH THOSE WITH ADEQUATE HEALTH LITERACY. PARTICIPANTS WHO HAD INADEQUATE HEALTH LITERACY HAD GREATER RISK OF CESAREAN DELIVERY (ADJUSTED RISK RATIO [ARR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01-1.23) AND MAJOR PERINEAL LACERATION (ARR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.03-2.01). THE ADJUSTED RISKS OF SMALL-FOR-GESTATIONAL-AGE STATUS (ARR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.14-1.58), LOW BIRTH WEIGHT (ARR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.07-1.65), AND 5-MINUTE APGAR SCORE LESS THAN 4 (ARR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.16-6.65) WERE GREATER FOR NEONATES BORN TO PARTICIPANTS WITH INADEQUATE HEALTH LITERACY. SENSITIVITY ANALYSES CONFIRMED THESE FINDINGS. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT INADEQUATE MATERNAL HEALTH LITERACY IS ASSOCIATED WITH A VARIETY OF ADVERSE MATERNAL AND NEONATAL OUTCOMES.","DIVISION OF MATERNAL-FETAL MEDICINE, DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FEINBERG SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.; DIVISION OF MATERNAL-FETAL MEDICINE, DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY, THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH, SALT LAKE CITY.; DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY, INDIANA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, INDIANAPOLIS.; DIVISION OF MATERNAL-FETAL MEDICINE, DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY, PERELMAN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, PHILADELPHIA.; DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY, THE METROHEALTH SYSTEM, CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY, CLEVELAND, OHIO.; DIVISION OF MATERNAL-FETAL MEDICINE, DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE.; DIVISION OF MATERNAL-FETAL MEDICINE, DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS, GYNECOLOGY, AND REPRODUCTIVE SCIENCE, YALE UNIVERSITY, NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT.; DIVISION OF MATERNAL-FETAL MEDICINE, DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MEDICAL BRANCH, GALVESTON.; DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS, GYNECOLOGY, AND REPRODUCTIVE SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA.; DIVISION OF MATERNAL-FETAL MEDICINE, DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FEINBERG SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.;",NA,NA,"CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES: DR SIMHAN REPORTED BEING A COFOUNDER OF NAIMA HEALTH, LLC.

BACKGROUND: MENTAL ILLNESS IS COMMON IN KENYA, YET THERE ARE FEWER THAN 500 SPECIALIST MENTAL HEALTH WORKERS TO SERVE KENYA'S POPULATION OF OVER 50 MILLION. THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION RECOMMENDS THE INTEGRATION OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE INTO PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO AND EQUITY OF THIS CARE, ESPECIALLY IN LOW AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES. AN IMPORTANT STEP TO INTEGRATING MENTAL HEALTH CARE INTO PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS TO DETERMINE MENTAL HEALTH LITERACY LEVELS OF THE PRIMARY HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE. METHOD: A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY USING JORM'S MENTAL HEALTH LITERACY INSTRUMENT (ADAPTED FOR THE KENYAN CONTEXT) WAS ADMINISTERED TO 310 PRIMARY HEALTH CARE WORKERS IN FOUR COUNTIES OF KENYA. RESULTS: OF THE 310 QUESTIONNAIRES DISTRIBUTED, 212 (68.3%) WERE RETURNED. OF THE RESPONDENTS, 13% HAD A FORMAL MENTAL HEALTH QUALIFICATION, WHILE ONLY 8.7% HAD RECEIVED RELEVANT CONTINUING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE FIVE YEARS PRECEDING THE SURVEY. JUST OVER ONE THIRD (35.6%) OF PRIMARY HEALTH CARE WORKERS COULD CORRECTLY IDENTIFY DEPRESSION, WITH EVEN FEWER RECOGNISING SCHIZOPHRENIA (15.7%). CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY PROVIDES PRELIMINARY INFORMATION ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH LITERACY AMONG PRIMARY HEALTH CARE WORKERS IN KENYA. THE MAJORITY OF RESPONDENTS HAD LOW MENTAL HEALTH LITERACY AS INDICATED BY THEIR INABILITY TO IDENTIFY COMMON MENTAL DISORDERS.

A HIGH LEVEL OF WORK-RELATED HL COULD SUPPORT WORK ABILITY AND IN THE LONGER RUN EMPLOYABILITY. THESE TOPICS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT IN CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND IN VIEW OF ONGOING DEVELOPMENTS (E.G., DIGITALIZATION AND \"NEW\" WORK). A BASIC UNDERSTANDING AND MEASUREMENT OF HL AS AN INDIVIDUAL COMPETENCE IN THE CONTEXT OF WORKING LIFE IS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP FUTURE INTERVENTIONS TO PROMOTE HL AMONG PEOPLE OF WORKING AGE. ACCORDING TO THE PARTICIPANTS, CONCEPT, AND CONTEXT (PCC) FRAMEWORK, WE INCLUDED ARTICLES ON HEALTH LITERACY (CONCEPT) IN THE TARGET GROUP OF PEOPLE OF WORKING AGE IN THE WORKPLACE (POPULATION AND CONTEXT). KEY INFORMATION SOURCES WERE THE DATABASES PUBMED, CINAHL, PSYCINFO, AND PSYNDEX. A TOTAL OF 30 ARTICLES WERE INCLUDED. THERE ARE SEVERAL TERMS FOR \"HEALTH LITERACY IN THE WORKPLACE\" (INCLUDING INDIVIDUAL WORK-RELATED OR OCCUPATIONAL HL). THE CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF THE INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE'S COMPETENCE COVERED ALL ASPECTS OF HL (\"ACCESS\", \"UNDERSTAND\", \"APPRAISE\", AND \"APPLY\" HEALTH INFORMATION).

HEALTH BEHAVIOR (=0.041) AND SELF-EFFICACY (=0.173) EXERTED A POSITIVE DIRECT EFFECT ON HEALTH STATUS. THE MODEL EXPLAINED 14.1% OF VARIANCE FOR HEALTH LITERACY, 3.8% FOR SELF-EFFICACY, 5.7% FOR HEALTH BEHAVIOR, AND 15.0% FOR HEALTH STATUS. CONCLUSIONS: HEALTH LITERACY WAS IDENTIFIED TO BE A CRITICAL FACTOR IN HEALTH STATUS. THE RESULTS EMPHASIZED THAT THE DISSEMINATION OF HEALTH KNOWLEDGE, DEVELOPMENT OF HEALTHY BEHAVIOR, AND CULTIVATION OF SELF-EFFICACY SHOULD BE JOINTLY PROMOTED TO REINFORCE THE LEVEL OF HEALTH STATUS AMONG RESIDENTS IN FUTURE WORK.","DEPARTMENT OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND HEALTH STATISTICS, THE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH OF QINGDAO UNIVERSITY, QINGDAO, CHINA.; QINGDAO MUNICIPAL CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, QINGDAO, SHANDONG, CHINA.; QINGDAO MUNICIPAL CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, QINGDAO, SHANDONG, CHINA.; QINGDAO MUNICIPAL CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, QINGDAO, SHANDONG, CHINA.; QINGDAO MUNICIPAL CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, QINGDAO, SHANDONG, CHINA.; QINGDAO MUNICIPAL CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, QINGDAO, SHANDONG, CHINA.; QINGDAO MUNICIPAL CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, QINGDAO, SHANDONG, CHINA.; QINGDAO MUNICIPAL CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, QINGDAO, SHANDONG, CHINA.; LSHPENG@163.;COM.;","ORCID: 0000-0003-0940-8742"," 2021.

THE MAJORITY (56%) OF THE REPORTED DIFFICULTIES CONCERNED ACCESSING, UNDERSTANDING, APPRAISING, AND APPLYING HEALTH INFORMATION. THE FINDINGS CONFIRM THAT HEALTH LITERACY FOLLOWS A SOCIAL GRADIENT, WHEREBY FINANCIALLY DEPRIVED INDIVIDUALS AND THOSE WITH A LOW EDUCATIONAL LEVEL REPORT LOWER HEALTH LITERACY.

DATA SOURCE: WITH RESPECT TO THE LINGUISTIC CONTENT, WE ANALYZED 283216 SECURE MESSAGES SENT BY 6941 DIABETES PATIENTS TO PHYSICIANS WITHIN AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM'S ELECTRONIC PORTAL. SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC, CLINICAL, AND UTILIZATION DATA WERE OBTAINED VIA QUESTIONNAIRE AND ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS. STUDY DESIGN: RETROSPECTIVE STUDY USED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND MACHINE LEARNING TO GENERATE FIVE UNIQUE \"LITERACY PROFILES\" BY EMPLOYING VARIOUS SETS OF LINGUISTIC INDICES: FLESCH-KINCAID (LP_FK); BASIC INDICES OF WRITING COMPLEXITY, INCLUDING LEXICAL DIVERSITY (LP_LD) AND WRITING QUALITY (LP_WQ); AND ADVANCED INDICES RELATED TO SYNTACTIC COMPLEXITY, LEXICAL SOPHISTICATION, AND DIVERSITY, MODELED FROM SELF-REPORTED (LP_SR), AND EXPERT-RATED (LP_EXP) HEALTH LITERACY. WE FIRST DETERMINED THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH LITERACY PROFILE RELATIVE TO SELF-REPORTED AND EXPERT-RATED HEALTH LITERACY TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN HIGH AND LOW HEALTH LITERACY AND THEN ASSESSED LITERACY PROFILES' RELATIONSHIPS WITH KNOWN CORRELATES OF HEALTH LITERACY, SUCH AS PATIENT SOCIODEMOGRAPHICS AND A RANGE OF HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES, INCLUDING RATINGS OF PHYSICIAN COMMUNICATION, MEDICATION ADHERENCE, DIABETES CONTROL, COMORBIDITIES, AND UTILIZATION. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: LP_SR AND LP_EXP PERFORMED BEST IN DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN HIGH AND LOW SELF-REPORTED (C-STATISTICS: 0.86 AND 0.58, RESPECTIVELY) AND EXPERT-RATED HEALTH LITERACY (C-STATISTICS: 0.71 AND 0.87, RESPECTIVELY) AND WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT, RACE/ETHNICITY, CONSUMER ASSESSMENT OF PROVIDER AND SYSTEMS (CAHPS) SCORES, ADHERENCE, GLYCEMIA, COMORBIDITIES, AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS. CONCLUSIONS: SINCE HEALTH LITERACY IS A POTENTIALLY REMEDIABLE EXPLANATORY FACTOR IN HEALTH CARE DISPARITIES, THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUTOMATED HEALTH LITERACY INDICATORS REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENT WITH BROAD CLINICAL AND POPULATION HEALTH APPLICATIONS.

INTERVENTIONS THAT PROMOTE HEALTH LITERACY MAY PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PREVENTION OF NCDS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HEALTH LITERACY INTERVENTIONS ON HEALTH LITERACY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH SELECTED NCDS LIVING IN LOW-TO-MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES (LMIC). METHODS: SEVEN ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED (OCTOBER 29, 2020) FOR RCTS AIMED AT IMPROVING HEALTH LITERACY IN ADULTS WITH NCDS IN LMICS. ELIGIBLE NCDS INCLUDED THOSE PERTAINING TO CANCER, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD), CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISEASE (CRD) OR DIABETES. STUDIES WERE INCLUDED THAT EXPLICITLY FOCUSSED ON IMPROVING HEALTH LITERACY, AND REPORTED COMPREHENSIVE MEASURES OF HEALTH LITERACY, OR COMPONENTS THEREOF (IE, KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE OR BEHAVIOUR). RANDOM-EFFECT META-ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED FOR CONTINUOUS OUTCOME MEASURES (HEDGES-G). RESULTS: THE COMPLETED SEARCH YIELDED 2573 UNIQUE RESULTS OF WHICH 53 UNIQUE STUDIES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. STUDIES INCLUDED PATIENTS WITH CANCER (N=1, 2%), CRD (N=8, 15%), CVD (N=11, 21%) OR DIABETES (N=33, 62%).

DATA ON HEALTH LITERACY AND SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS WERE ACQUIRED WITH AN INTERNATIONALLY COORDINATED QUESTIONNAIRE. THE INSTRUMENT FOR MEASURING GENERAL HEALTH LITERACY CONSISTED OF 47 QUESTIONS THAT REFLECT AN INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO ACCESS, UNDERSTAND, APPRAISE, AND APPLY HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION. THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN GENERAL HEALTH LITERACY AND SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS WERE ANALYZED USING BIVARIATE AND MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL TESTS. RESULTS: 58.8% OF THE PARTICIPANTS HAD LOW HEALTH LITERACY, CHARACTERIZED BY RATING AT LEAST ONETHIRD OF THE QUESTIONS AS \"DIFFICULT\" OR \"VERY DIFFICULT.\" MANY RESPONDENTS STATED THAT THEY HAD DIFFICULTIES ACCESSING (48.3%), UNDERSTANDING (47.7%), AND APPLYING (53.5%) INFORMATION, AND EVEN MORE OF THEM (74.7%) REPORTED DIFFICULTIES APPRAISING INFORMATION. THE CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS REVEAL THAT HEALTH LITERACY IS WEAKLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES: AGE, SEX, SOCIAL STATUS, LITERACY, LEVEL OF EDUCATION, FINANCIAL DEPRIVATION, MIGRATION BACKGROUND, AND THE PRESENCE OF ONE OR MORE CHRONIC DISEASES. CONCLUSION: THE FINDINGS OF THE HLS-GER 2 HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR ACTION IN PROMOTING HEALTH LITERACY IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AS THE EXPLANATION OF VARIANCE IS LOW, THERE ARE PRESUMABLY OTHER IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH LITERACY THAT WERE NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.

STUDY DESIGN: THIS IS A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY DESIGN. METHODS: HEALTH LITERACY WAS ASSESSED THROUGH FACE-TO-FACE INTERVIEWS IN EIGHT PRIMARY HEALTHCARE CENTERS (PHCS) IN MOUNT LEBANON. THE QUESTIONNAIRE CONSISTED OF THE ARABIC FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY SCALE, THE SHORT VERSION OF THE EUROPEAN HEALTH LITERACY SURVEY (HLS-EU-Q16), SOCIO-ECONOMIC QUESTIONS (SEX, AGE, NATIONALITY, MARITAL STATUS, EDUCATIONAL LEVEL, AND ABILITY TO PAY FOR MEDICAL FEES AT PHCS), AND HEALTH-RELATED QUESTIONS (SELF-PERCEIVED HEALTH, LONG-TERM ILLNESS, RECENT VISIT TO HEALTH CARE, AND FREEDOM TO MAKE HEALTH DECISIONS). STATISTICAL ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED TO EVALUATE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY (FHL), COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH LITERACY (CHL), AND POTENTIAL EXPLANATORY VARIABLES. RESULTS: OF 263 PARTICIPANTS (61.6% FEMALES), MEAN AGE 38.4912.80 YEARS, 52.1% HAD INADEQUATE FHL AND 35.7% HAD INADEQUATE CHL. THE LIKELIHOOD OF HAVING INADEQUATE CHL WAS HIGHER IN REFUGEES WHO WERE EVER MARRIED (ODDS RATIO [OR]=2.794; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI]: 1.187-6.576) OR HAD AVERAGE ABILITY TO PAY FOR MEDICAL EXPENSES AT PHC (OR=4.562; 95% CI: 1.554-13.393). THE ODDS OF HAVING INADEQUATE FHL WAS LOWER IN REFUGEES WITH SOME LEVEL OF EDUCATION (OR=0.211; 95% CI: 0.077-0.580).

EFFECTIVE SELF-MANAGEMENT COULD SLOW DISEASE PROGRESSION AND IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES, ALTHOUGH THE CONTRIBUTION OF HEALTH LITERACY AND KNOWLEDGE FOR SELF-MANAGEMENT IS NOT WELL KNOWN. AIM: TO INVESTIGATE THE RECENT EVIDENCE OF HEALTH LITERACY AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY, KNOWLEDGE AND SELF-MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE. METHODS: ARKSEY AND O'MALLEY'S FRAMEWORK INFORMED THIS SCOPING REVIEW. ELIGIBLE STUDIES INVOLVING ADULTS WITH ANY GRADE OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE, MEASURING ALL DIMENSIONS OF HEALTH LITERACY (I.E., FUNCTIONAL, COMMUNICATIVE, AND CRITICAL), DISEASE-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGEAND SELF-MANAGEMENT, PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH BETWEEN JANUARY 2005 AND MARCH 2020, WERE INCLUDED. RESULTS: THE SCOPING REVIEW FOUND 12 ELIGIBLE STUDIES, WITH 11 ASSESSING ALL DIMENSIONS OF HEALTH LITERACY. NO STUDY EXAMINED HEALTH LITERACY, KNOWLEDGE AND SELF-MANAGEMENT. WHEN INDIVIDUALS HAD GREATER HEALTH LITERACY, THIS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE DISEASE. COMMUNICATIVE HEALTH LITERACY WAS A SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF MEDICATION, DIET AND FLUID ADHERENCE, AND OVERALL SELF-MANAGEMENT BEHAVIOURS. CONCLUSION: THIS SCOPING REVIEW SHOWS THAT DISEASE-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE IS IMPORTANT FOR HEALTH LITERACYAND THAT HEALTH LITERACY IS ESSENTIAL FOR EFFECTIVE SELF-MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS CAN INFORM STRATEGIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVIDENCE-BASED PATIENT EDUCATION TO SUPPORT INCREASED SELF-MANAGEMENT.

IN THIS STUDY, THE ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH LITERACY WITH MENTAL HEALTH, COMPLIANCE WITH COVID-19 PREVENTIVE MEASURES AND HEALTH PROSPECTS WAS ASSESSED IN A BELGIAN CONTEXT. METHODS: DATA WERE EXTRACTED FROM THE THIRD OF A SERIES OF CROSS-SECTIONAL ONLINE COVID-RELATED SURVEYS (N=32,794). DATA COLLECTION TOOK PLACE FOR 1 WEEK STARTING THE 28TH OF MAY 2020. PEOPLE RESIDING IN BELGIUM AND AGED 18YEARS OR OLDER COULD PARTICIPATE. DATA WERE COLLECTED ON SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND, HEALTH LITERACY, MULTIMORBIDITY, MENTAL HEALTH (DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, SLEEPING DISORDER, VITALITY), KNOWLEDGE ABOUT COVID-19, COMPLIANCE WITH COVID-19 MEASURES (HYGIENE, PHYSICAL DISTANCE, COVERING MOUTH AND NOSE ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND IN PLACES WHERE PHYSICAL DISTANCE CANNOT BE RESPECTED), AND HEALTH PROSPECTS (RISK FOR HEALTH WHEN RETURNING TO NORMAL LIFE AND POSSIBILITY OF INFECTION). PREVALENCE RATIO (PR) OF POOR MENTAL HEALTH, NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE MEASURES AND HEALTH PROSPECTS IN RELATION TO HEALTH LITERACY WERE CALCULATED USING POISSON REGRESSIONS. RESULTS: PEOPLE SHOWING SUFFICIENT HEALTH LITERACY WERE LESS LIKELY TO SUFFER FROM ANXIETY DISORDERS (PR=0.47, 95% CI=[0.42-0.53]), DEPRESSION (PR=0.46, 95% CI=[0.40-0.52]) AND SLEEPING DISORDERS (PR=0.85, 95% CI=[0.82-0.87]), AND MORE LIKELY TO HAVE OPTIMAL VITALITY (PR=2.41, 95% CI=[2.05-2.84]) THAN PEOPLE WITH LOW HEALTH LITERACY. THEY WERE LESS AT RISK OF NOT COMPLYING WITH THE COVID-19 MEASURES (PR BETWEEN 0.60 AND 0.83) EXCEPT ONE (COVERING MOUTH AND NOSE IN PLACES WHERE PHYSICAL DISTANCE CANNOT BE RESPECTED). FINALLY, THEY WERE LESS LIKELY TO PERCEIVE RETURNING TO NORMAL LIFE AS THREATENING (PR=0.70, 95% CI=[0.65-0.77]) AND TO CONSIDER THEMSELVES AT RISK OF AN INFECTION WITH COVID-19 (PR=0.75, 95% CI=[0.67-0.84]).

HOWEVER, THERE IS ALSO A LARGE AMOUNT OF INAPPROPRIATE AND BIASED MEDICAL- AND DRUG-RELATED INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET. THEREFORE, PATIENTS REQUIRE A HIGH LEVEL OF HEALTH LITERACY TO ENSURE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND SAFETY OF PHARMACOTHERAPY. IN PARTICULAR, OUTPATIENTS NEED A HIGH LEVEL OF HEALTH LITERACY BECAUSE THEY USE THEIR OWN MEDICATIONS WITHOUT THE SUPERVISION OF HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS.

METHODS: THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK WAS DEVELOPED BASED ON ANDERSEN'S BEHAVIORAL MODEL OF HEALTH SERVICES USE AND HEALTH LITERACY SKILLS FRAMEWORK. AN ONLINE CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED WITH SNOWBALL SAMPLING METHOD, WHILE THE HEALTH LITERACY WAS MEASURED BY SELF-DESIGNED PATIENT HEALTH LITERACY SCALE, AND THE PATIENT EXPERIENCE WAS MEASURED BY THE CHINESE PATIENT EXPERIENCE QUESTIONNAIRE FOR AMBULATORY CARE DEVELOPED BY PEKING UNION MEDICAL COLLEGE. AND A STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODEL WAS BUILT TO EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM AND TEST THE MECHANISM OF HEALTH LITERACY INFLUENCING PATIENT EXPERIENCE. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 2 773 SUBJECTS WERE INVESTIGATED. THE AVERAGE SCORE OF HEALTH LITERACY WAS (90.7212.90) POINTS, ACCOUNTING FOR 78.89% OF THE FULL SCORE, AND THE DIMENSION OF SEEKING SOCIAL SUPPORT HAD THE LOWEST SCORE. THE AVERAGE SCORE OF OVERALL RATING OF PATIENT EXPERIENCE WAS (3.710.74) POINTS, AND THE SCORES OF EACH DIMENSION OF PATIENT EXPERIENCE WERE BETWEEN 3.56 AND 3.80. THE MODEL FIT INDICES OF STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODEL FOR OVERALL RATING OF PATIENT EXPERIENCE AMONG THE OUTPATIENTS WERE (2)/DF=9.29 ((2)=4 107.27, DF=442), ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR OF APPROXIMATION (RMSEA)=0.055 (< 0.06), COMPARATIVE FIT INDEX (CFI)=0.926 (>0.90), TUCKER-LEWIS INDEX (TLI)=0.918 (>0.90), STANDARDIZED ROOT MEAN SQUARE RESIDUAL (SRMR)=0.061 (< 0.08), THE MODEL WAS ACCEPTABLE. THE VARIANCE IN PATIENT EXPERIENCE EXPLAINED BY THE MODEL WAS 0.108. THE STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODEL ANALYSIS RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE OVERALL RATING OF OUTPATIENT EXPERIENCE WAS DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY HEALTH LITERACY (=0.263, P < 0.001), ALSO INDIRECTLY AFFECTED BY HEALTH LITERACY (=0.012, P < 0.001). IN OTHER WORDS, THE OVERALL RATING INCREASED BY 0.275 UNITS FOR EACH STANDARD DEVIATION INCREASE OF HEALTH LITERACY. SELF-EVALUATED HEALTH STATUS MEDIATED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND THE OVERALL RATING OF OUTPATIENT EXPERIENCE. IN TERMS OF DIFFE-RENT DIMENSIONS OF PATIENT EXPERIENCE, THE STANDARDIZED PATH COEFFICIENT OF THE TOTAL EFFECT OF HEALTH LITERACY ON PATIENT EXPERIENCE WAS AS FOLLOWS: INFORMATION GUIDANCE 0.337, HUMANISTIC CARE 0.319, COMMUNICATION WITH DOCTORS 0.294, SERVICE EFFICIENCY 0.240, AND HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT 0.173. CONCLUSION: THE PATIENTS WITH HIGHER LEVEL OF HEALTH LITERACY WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A BETTER OUTPATIENT EXPERIENCE IN CHINA, AND THE INFORMATION GUIDANCE EXPERIENCE AND HUMANISTIC CARE EXPERIENCE WERE MOST AFFECTED BY HEALTH LITERACY.

METHODS: A TOTAL OF 196 TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS WERE INCLUDED IN A PROSPECTIVE FOLLOW-UP STUDY. THE PATIENTS ANSWERED THE HEALTH LITERACY QUESTIONNAIRE (HLQ) AT 5 DAYS, 8 WEEKS, 6 AND 12 MONTHS FOLLOWING THE KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION. MIXED LINEAR MODELS WERE USED TO ANALYZE CHANGES IN HL AND BACKWARD ELIMINATION WAS USED TO IDENTIFY VARIABLES ASSOCIATED WITH HL. RESULTS: TWO MAIN PATTERNS OF CHANGE WERE IDENTIFIED: A) HL INCREASED DURING THE FIRST 8 WEEKS OF CLOSE FOLLOW-UP AND B) IN SEVERAL DOMAINS, THE POSITIVE INCREASE FROM 5 DAYS TO 8 WEEKS FLATTENED OUT FROM 5 DAYS TO 6 AND 12 MONTHS. SELF-EFFICACY, TRANSPLANT-RELATED KNOWLEDGE, AND GENERAL HEALTH WERE CORE VARIABLES ASSOCIATED WITH HL. CONCLUSIONS: OVERALL, HL INCREASED DURING THE 8 WEEKS OF CLOSE FOLLOW-UP FOLLOWING THE KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION, WHILE 6 MONTHS SEEM TO BE A MORE VULNERABLE PHASE. FURTHERMORE, LOW SELF-EFFICACY, LESS KNOWLEDGE, AND LOW SELF-PERCEIVED HEALTH MAY REPRESENT VULNERABLE CHARACTERISTICS IN PATIENTS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: FUTURE KIDNEY TRANSPLANT CARE SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT PATIENTS' ACCESS TO AND APPRAISAL OF HEALTH INFORMATION AND SOCIAL SUPPORT, AND DRAW ATTENTION TO POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE GROUPS.","THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPLANTATION MEDICINE, OSLO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, OSLO, NORWAY.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: DAHKAR@OUS-HF.;NO.; THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPLANTATION MEDICINE, OSLO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, OSLO, NORWAY; THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERDISCIPLINARY HEALTH SCIENCES, INSTITUTE OF HEALTH AND SOCIETY, FACULTY OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF OSLO, OSLO, NORWAY.; THE FACULTY OF HEALTH SCIENCES, DEPARTMENT OF QUALITY AND HEALTH TECHNOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF STAVANGER, STAVANGER, NORWAY.; OSLO CENTRE FOR BIOSTATISTICS AND EPIDEMIOLOGY, OSLO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, OSLO, NORWAY.; THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPLANTATION MEDICINE, OSLO UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, OSLO, NORWAY; THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERDISCIPLINARY HEALTH SCIENCES, INSTITUTE OF HEALTH AND SOCIETY, FACULTY OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF OSLO, OSLO, NORWAY.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT 2021 THE AUTHORS.

IDENTIFYING MEASUREMENT ERROR OF HEALTH-RELATED INSTRUMENTS HELPS DEVELOP ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF HEALTH-RELATED CONSTRUCTS. OBJECTIVE: WE COMPARED THE INTERNAL CONSISTENCY OF EIGHT PSYCHOLOGICAL SCALES USED IN HEALTH RESEARCH IN GROUPS WITH ADEQUATE VERSUS LIMITED HEALTH LITERACY AND IN GROUPS WITH HIGHER VERSUS LOWER EDUCATION. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS (N = 1,005) FROM A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE INTERNET PANEL COMPLETED EIGHT SELF-REPORT SCALES: (1) INFORMATION AVOIDANCE, (2) COGNITIVE CAUSATION, (3) UNPREDICTABILITY, (4) PERCEIVED SEVERITY, (5) TIME ORIENTATION, (6) INTERNAL HEALTH LOCUS OF CONTROL, (7) NEED FOR COGNITION, AND (8) SOCIAL DESIRABILITY. THE FIRST FOUR ASSESS BELIEFS ABOUT DIABETES AND COLON CANCER. WE USED THE NEWEST VITAL SIGN TO CATEGORIZE PARTICIPANTS' HEALTH LITERACY (LIMITED VS. ADEQUATE). WE ALSO CATEGORIZED PARTICIPANTS' EDUCATION (HIGH SCHOOL OR LESS VS. MORE THAN HIGH SCHOOL). WE COMPARED THE CRONBACH'S ALPHA FOR EACH PSYCHOLOGICAL SCALE BETWEEN GROUPS WITH DIFFERENT HEALTH LITERACY AND EDUCATION LEVELS USING THE FELDT TEST. KEY RESULTS: AMONG ALL THE 13 SUBSCALES, SCALE INTERNAL CONSISTENCY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AMONG PEOPLE WITH LIMITED HEALTH LITERACY THAN THOSE WITH ADEQUATE HEALTH LITERACY FOR FIVE SUBSCALES: INFORMATION AVOIDANCE FOR COLON CANCER (0.80 VS. 0.88), UNPREDICTABILITY OF DIABETES (0.84 VS. 0.88), PERCEIVED SEVERITY FOR DIABETES (0.66 VS. 0.75), NEED FOR COGNITION (0.63 VS. 0.82), AND SOCIAL DESIRABILITY (0.52 VS. 0.68). INTERNAL CONSISTENCY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AMONG PEOPLE WHO HAD A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION OR LESS THAN AMONG THOSE WITH MORE THAN A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION FOR FOUR SCALES: PERCEIVED SEVERITY OF DIABETES (0.70 VS. 0.75), PRESENT ORIENTATION (0.60 VS. 0.66), NEED FOR COGNITION (0.73 VS. 0.80), AND SOCIAL DESIRABILITY (0.61 VS. 0.70). CONCLUSIONS: SEVERAL PSYCHOLOGICAL INSTRUMENTS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER INTERNAL CONSISTENCY WHEN USED IN A SAMPLE WITH LIMITED HEALTH LITERACY OR EDUCATION.

WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER HEALTH LITERACY SKILLS, EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT, OR MELANOMA RISK WERE RELATED TO SHORT-TERM COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE RESPONSES TO GENETIC TEST RESULTS. RESULTS: ON AVERAGE, PARTICIPANTS FOUND THE TEST RESULTS TO BE HIGHLY BELIEVABLE AND CLEAR, WITH LOW LEVELS OF NEGATIVE EMOTIONAL RESPONSES AND MODERATE LEVELS OF POSITIVE RESPONSES. IN ADJUSTED MODELS, HEALTH LITERACY SKILLS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY INVERSELY ASSOCIATED WITH CONFUSION (OR=0.75, 95 % CI=0.58, 0.96); THOSE WITH HIGHER EDUCATION THOUGHT SIGNIFICANTLY LESS ABOUT THEIR TEST RESULTS (=-0.66), WERE LESS HOPEFUL (=-0.89), AND HAD LOWER DISTRESS (=-1.15).

A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY OF MEDICAL STUDENTS WAS CONDUCTED THROUGH CONVENIENCE SAMPLING IN EAST CHINA. ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN VARIABLES WERE EXPLORED USING OLS AND THE MEDIATION EFFECT WAS ESTIMATED USING THE KARLSON, HOLM AND BREEN METHOD. A TOTAL OF 746 VALID QUESTIONNAIRES WERE COLLECTED. THE PREVALENCE OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AMONG THE SAMPLE WAS 32.4%. HIGHER HEALTH LITERACY LEVELS AND SOCIAL SUPPORTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER LEVELS OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. SOCIAL SUPPORT PARTIALLY MEDIATED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, ACCOUNTING FOR A 54.03% OF THE TOTAL EFFECT SIZE. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT INTERVENTIONS FOR MEDICAL STUDENT MENTAL WELLBEING COULD IMPROVE HEALTH LITERACY. WHILST FAMILY SUPPORT REFLECTS GREATEST IMPACT, UNIVERSITIES CAN ALSO LEAD AND INNOVATE NOVEL INTERVENTIONS FOR THIS CRITICAL STAGE OF LIFE. FUTURE RESEARCH CAN EXTEND THIS STUDY BY EXPLORING THE DYNAMIC INTERACTIONS BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, AND OTHER SOURCES OF SOCIAL SUPPORT. COMPARISONS OF THESE FINDINGS ACROSS THE DIFFERENT REGIONS OF CHINA AND IN OTHER UNIVERSITY SUBJECT DISCIPLINES ARE ALSO WARRANTED.","SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, NANTONG UNIVERSITY, NANTONG 210029, CHINA.; MACQUARIE UNIVERSITY CENTRE FOR THE HEALTH ECONOMY, MACQUARIE BUSINESS SCHOOL, MACQUARIE UNIVERSITY, MACQUARIE PARK, NSW 2109, AUSTRALIA.; DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SYSTEMS AND POPULATIONS, MACQUARIE UNIVERSITY, MACQUARIE PARK, NSW 2109, AUSTRALIA.; SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, NANTONG UNIVERSITY, NANTONG 210029, CHINA.; SCHOOL OF SCIENCES, NANTONG UNIVERSITY, NANTONG 210029, CHINA.; MACQUARIE UNIVERSITY CENTRE FOR THE HEALTH ECONOMY, MACQUARIE BUSINESS SCHOOL, MACQUARIE UNIVERSITY, MACQUARIE PARK, NSW 2109, AUSTRALIA.;","ORCID: 0000-0002-3816-9106",NA,"THE AUTHORS DECLARE NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST.",NA,"2021/01/16 01:02","20210318","20210113",2021,"2021/01/17 06:00",NA,NA,"2","1660-4601 (ELECTRONIC) 1661-7827 (PRINT) 1660-4601 (LINKING)","101238455","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH","ENG","10.3390/IJERPH18020633 [DOI] 633","20210318","2021/03/19 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM",NA,NA,"PMC7828636",NA,"33451118","EPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"INT J ENVIRON RES PUBLIC HEALTH. 2021 JAN 13;18(2):633.

HOWEVER, RESEARCH HAS NOT EXPLORED WHETHER LOW HEALTH LITERACY PREDICTS THE ONSET OF CKD. METHODS: WE USED DATA FROM PARTICIPANTS OF LIFELINES, A PROSPECTIVE POPULATION-BASED COHORT STUDY OF INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN THE NETHERLANDS, TO ASSESS THE SHARE OF INDIVIDUALS WITH LOW HEALTH LITERACY BY EGFR CATEGORY, WHETHER LOW HEALTH LITERACY IS ASSOCIATED WITH CKD ONSET IN THE GENERAL POPULATION AND IN THE SUBGROUP OF OLDER ADULTS, AND WHETHER ESTABLISHED CKD RISK FACTORS MEDIATE THIS ASSOCIATION. RESULTS: IN THE TOTAL SAMPLE OF 93,885 ADULTS (MEAN FOLLOW-UP 3.9 YEARS), LOW HEALTH LITERACY WAS MORE LIKELY AMONG INDIVIDUALS IN WORSE EGFR CATEGORIES, INCREASING FROM 26.4% IN EGFR CATEGORY 1 TO 50.0% IN CATEGORY 5 (P=0.02). LOW HEALTH LITERACY, COMPARED WITH ADEQUATE HEALTH LITERACY, WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ONSET OF CKD IN THE TOTAL SAMPLE (3.0% VERSUS 2.1%) AND IN THE SUBGROUP OF OLDER ADULTS (13.4% VERSUS 11.3%), WITH ODDS RATIOS (ORS) OF 1.44 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (95% CI), 1.31 TO 1.59) AND 1.21 (95% CI, 1.04 TO 1.41), RESPECTIVELY.

THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO REVEAL THE LEVELS OF HEALTH LITERACY AMONG DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUPS AND THE AFFECTING FACTORS AS WELL AS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND HEALTH PERCEPTIONS. METHODS: THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT WITH DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUPS (KURDISH, ARAB, TURKISH AND ASSYRIAN ORIGIN), BETWEEN 18 AND 65YEARS OLD IN THE PROVINCE OF MARDIN IN TURKEY. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED WITH A TOTAL OF 600 PEOPLE. THE EUROPEAN HEALTH LITERACY SCALE-TURKISH ADAPTATION (EHLS-TR) AND HEALTH PERCEPTION SCALE (HPS) WERE USED FOR MEASUREMENT. DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS, MANN WHITNEY U TEST, KRUSKAL WALLIS TEST AND SPEARMAN CORRELATION WERE USED IN THE DATA ANALYSIS. RESULTS: IT WAS FOUND THAT 80.7% OF THE PARTICIPANTS HAD RELATIVELY LOW LEVELS OF HEALTH LITERACY. THE LOWEST LEVELS OF HEALTH LITERACY WERE AMONG THOSE OF KURDISH ORIGIN. THERE WERE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN SUFFICIENT LEVELS OF HEALTH LITERACY AND SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING BEING OF ASSYRIAN ORIGIN, BEING 50-65YEARS OLD, LIVING IN A NUCLEAR FAMILY, BEING A SECONDARY SCHOOL GRADUATE, HAVING A HIGH FINANCIAL STATUS, BEING RETIRED, EVALUATING ONE'S OWN HEALTH STATUS AS GOOD, OBTAINING HEALTH INFORMATION FROM HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS, PREFERRING TO VISIT A STATE HOSPITAL TO SEEK MEDICAL ASSISTANCE FIRST, SMOKING AND DRINKING ALCOHOL.

PARTICIPANTS: WOMEN AGES 40-54 WITH LIMITED HEALTH LITERACY AND NO HISTORY OF BREAST CANCER OR MAMMOGRAM IN THE PRIOR 9MONTHS WERE APPROACHED BEFORE A PRIMARY CARE VISIT AT A BOSTON ACADEMIC, SAFETY-NET HOSPITAL. PCPS PRACTICING AT THIS SITE WERE ELIGIBLE FOR PCP INTERVIEWS. APPROACH: INTERVIEWS WERE AUDIO-RECORDED AND TRANSCRIBED VERBATIM. A SET OF DEDUCTIVE CODES FOR EACH STAKEHOLDER GROUP WAS DEVELOPED BASED ON LITERATURE AND THE INTERVIEW GUIDE. INDUCTIVE CODES WERE GENERATED DURING CODEBOOK DEVELOPMENT. CODES WERE COMPARED WITHIN AND ACROSS PATIENT AND PCP INTERVIEWS TO CREATE THEMES RELEVANT TO MAMMOGRAPHY DECISION-MAKING. KEY RESULTS: THE AVERAGE AGE OF 25 INTERVIEWED PATIENTS WAS 46.5; 18 IDENTIFIED AS BLACK, 3 AS HISPANIC, 2 AS NON-HISPANIC WHITE, AND 2 HAD NO RECORDED RACE OR ETHNICITY. OF 20 PCPS, 15 WERE FEMALE; 12 HAD PRACTICED FOR >5YEARS. PATIENTS DESCRIBED A LACK OF TECHNICAL (APPROPRIATE TESTS AND WHAT THEY DO) AND PROCESS (WHAT HAPPENS DURING A MAMMOGRAM VISIT) KNOWLEDGE, VIEWING THESE AS NECESSARY FOR DECISION-MAKING. PCPS WERE RELUCTANT TO ENGAGE PATIENTS WITH LIMITED HEALTH LITERACY IN SDM DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS AND FEARED THAT INCREASED INFORMATION MIGHT CONFUSE PATIENTS OR DETER THEM FROM HAVING MAMMOGRAMS. BOTH GROUPS FELT PRE-VISIT EDUCATION WOULD FACILITATE MAMMOGRAPHY-RELATED SDM DURING CLINICAL VISITS. CONCLUSION: BOTH PATIENTS AND PCPS PERCEIVED A NEED FOR TOOLS TO RELAY TECHNICAL AND PROCESS KNOWLEDGE ABOUT MAMMOGRAPHY PRIOR TO CLINICAL ENCOUNTERS TO ADDRESS THE SCOPE OF INFORMATION THAT PATIENTS WITH LIMITED HEALTH LITERACY DESIRED.","DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, SECTION OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE, WOMEN'S HEALTH UNIT, BOSTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, BOSTON, MA, USA.; CHRISTINE.;GUNN@BMC.;ORG.; DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH LAW, POLICY AND MANAGEMENT, BOSTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, BOSTON, MA, USA.; CHRISTINE.;GUNN@BMC.;ORG.; DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, SECTION OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE, WOMEN'S HEALTH UNIT, BOSTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, BOSTON, MA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, SECTION OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE, BOSTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, BOSTON, MA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, SECTION OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE, BOSTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, BOSTON, MA, USA.; BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MA, USA.; DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, SECTION OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE, WOMEN'S HEALTH UNIT, BOSTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, BOSTON, MA, USA.;","ORCID: 0000-0003-3340-2834",NA,"THE AUTHORS DECLARE THAT THEY HAVE NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST.",NA,"2020/09/16 05:42","20210524","20200915",2021,"2020/09/17 06:00",NA,"1K07CA221899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/UNITED STATES","4","1525-1497 (ELECTRONIC) 0884-8734 (PRINT) 0884-8734 (LINKING)","8605834","JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE","ENG","10.1007/S11606-020-06213-2 [DOI]","20210524","2021/05/25 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","938-945",NA,"PMC8042081","2022/04/01","32935318","PPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"J GEN INTERN MED. 2021 APR;36(4):938-945.

FURTHERMORE, ADOLESCENT HEALTH LITERACY RESEARCH OVERLOOKS ADOLESCENT DEVELOPMENT-SPECIFIC NEEDS AND SKILLS. THEREFORE, WE QUALITATIVELY EXPLORED ADOLESCENTS' (1) DEFINITIONS OF HEALTH LITERACY, PREVENTIVE HEALTH BEHAVIORS, AND HEALTH RISK BEHAVIORS; AND (2) PERCEPTION OF THE HEALTH LITERACY/HEALTH BEHAVIOR RELATIONSHIP. METHODS: SIX SEMI-STRUCTURED FOCUS GROUPS WERE CONDUCTED WITH ADOLESCENTS (N=37) WHO ANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF HEALTH LITERACY, PREVENTIVE HEALTH BEHAVIORS, AND HEALTH RISK BEHAVIORS. FOCUS GROUPS WERE CODED USING THEMATIC ANALYSIS. THEMES REPRESENTING ADOLESCENTS' DEFINITIONS OF HEALTH LITERACY WERE SECONDARILY CODED FOR ALIGNMENT WITH DEFINITIONS IN THE LITERATURE. RESULTS: SOME OF ADOLESCENTS' HEALTH LITERACY DEFINITIONS ALIGNED WITH THE ADULT HEALTH LITERACY LITERATURE. THEY CONSIDERED HEALTH LITERACY A TOOL FOR INFORMED DECISION-MAKING, BUT ACKNOWLEDGED NOT ALWAYS USING THESE SKILLS. CONCLUSIONS: ADOLESCENTS' DEFINITIONS OF HEALTH LITERACY WERE MULTIDIMENSIONAL, GOING BEYOND NUMERACY AND LITERACY SKILLS.

AIM: TO EVALUATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND HEALTH AND TREATMENT OUTCOMES (CONCORDANCE WITH ORAL ANTICOAGULANTS, NORMALIZED RATIO CONTROL AND OCCURRENCE OF COMPLICATIONS) IN PATIENTS WITH CARDIOVASCULAR PATHOLOGY. METHODS: OBSERVATIONAL, ANALYTIC AND CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY CARRIED OUT ON 252 PATIENTS WITH CARDIOVASCULAR PATHOLOGY (ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FLUTTER OR VALVE PROSTHESIS), AGED 50-85YEARS, ACCESSING PRIMARY CARE SERVICES IN VALENCIA (SPAIN) IN 2018-2019.

WE USED DATABASES, INCLUDING PUBMED AND PSYCINFO, AND HANDSEARCHING OF THE REFERENCE LISTS TO IDENTIFY ARTICLES PUBLISHED BEFORE DECEMBER 2020. PAIN SELF-MANAGEMENT VARIABLES WERE CHOSEN BASED ON THE INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY SELF-MANAGEMENT THEORY. QUALITY WAS ASSESSED USING THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH QUALITY ASSESSMENT TOOL FOR OBSERVATIONAL AND CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDIES. RESULTS: TWENTY STUDIES THAT INCLUDED 6173 PARTICIPANTS WERE USED. MOST STUDIES MEASURED FUNCTIONAL DOMAINS OF THE HEALTH LITERACY CONCEPT. TWELVE STUDIES REPORTED SMALL TO LARGE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND PAIN KNOWLEDGE, MEDICATION REGIMEN ADHERENCE, OR PAIN. THIRTEEN STUDIES CONSIDERED HEALTH LITERACY CLINICAL RISKS IN TAILORING EDUCATION, WHILE SEVEN VIEWED IT AS PERSONAL ASSETS DEVELOPED VIA EDUCATION. CONCLUSIONS: LIMITED INFORMATION ON THE CONTRIBUTION OF HEALTH LITERACY TO PAIN SELF-MANAGEMENT CONTEXT FACTORS AND PROCESSES EXISTS. CURRENT EVIDENCE WAS LIMITED BY A LACK OF TEMPORALITY, THEORETICAL BASIS, AND A PRIORI SAMPLE ESTIMATION.

METHODS: THIS SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS UTILIZED INFORMATION FROM THE 2016 BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM (BRFSS). THE PRIMARY EXPOSURE WAS SELF-REPORTED HEALTH LITERACY, AND THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS WHETHER PATIENTS UNDERWENT PRIOR PSA TESTING. MALES 55-69 YEARS OLD FROM 13 STATES WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY AND WERE EXCLUDED IF THEY HAD ANY MISSING DATA. PARTICIPANTS WERE CATEGORIZED INTO LOW, MODERATE, OR HIGH LEVEL OF HEALTH LITERACY. CONFOUNDERS WERE ADJUSTED FOR USING BINARY LOGISTIC REGRESSION. ODDS RATIOS (OR) AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CI) WERE CALCULATED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 12,149 PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED. FIVE PERCENT OF PARTICIPANTS REPORTED LOW HEALTH LITERACY, 54% MODERATE HEALTH LITERACY, AND 41% HIGH HEALTH LITERACY. COMPARED WITH STUDY PARTICIPANTS WHO SELF-REPORTED HIGH LEVELS OF HEALTH LITERACY, THE ODDS OF UNDERGOING PSA TESTING WERE 59% LOWER IN THOSE WITH LOW HEALTH LITERACY (OR 0.41; 95% CI 0.28-0.64) AND 30% LOWER IN THOSE WITH MODERATE HEALTH LITERACY (OR 0.70; 95% CI 0.60-0.83). CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES A POSITIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SELF-REPORTED HEALTH LITERACY AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF PSA SCREENING.

OUTCOMES INCLUDED PARTICIPANT REACTIONS, CONFIDENCE (RANGE: 6-30), BEHAVIOURAL INTENTIONS (RANGE: 6-42), AND DISSEMINATION OF TRAINING CONTENT. IMPLEMENTATION OUTCOMES WERE EVALUATED USING THE NORMALIZATION MEASURE DEVELOPMENT (NOMAD) TOOL, ASSESSING THE CONSTRUCTS OF COHERENCE (RANGE: 4-20), COGNITIVE PARTICIPATION (RANGE: 4-20), COLLECTIVE ACTION (RANGE: 7-35) AND REFLEXIVE MONITORING (RANGE: 5-25). RESULTS: OF THE 29 ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO PARTICIPATED, 90% RATED THE PROGRAM AS 'EXCELLENT'/'VERY GOOD', AND 97% SAID THE INFORMATION WAS 'EXTREMELY'/'VERY' HELPFUL FOR THEIR EVERYDAY PRACTICE. WE OBSERVED INCREASES IN CONFIDENCE (MEAN DIFFERENCE [MD]=6.3, STANDARD DEVIATION [SD]=2.7, T(25) =11.87, P<.001) AND INTENTIONS (MD=3.6, SD=8.1, T(23) =2.2, P=.04) RELATED TO HEALTH LITERACY PRACTICES AFTER 6WEEKS.

HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) AND HEALTH LITERACY ARE RELATED AMONG THOSE WITH THE TWO MOST COMMON TYPES OF HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE: SUBSIDIZED (THOSE WITH LOWER INCOMES) AND CONTRIBUTORY (THOSE WITH HIGHER INCOMES) COVERAGE. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: IN THE CURRENT EXPLORATORY INVESTIGATION, DATA FROM ADULTS VISITING SIX PRIMARY CARE CLINICS IN COLOMBIA WERE ANALYSED TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HRQOL (ASSESSED AS PROBLEMS WITH MOBILITY, SELF-CARE, COMPLETING USUAL ACTIVITIES, PAIN/DISCOMFORT, AND ANXIETY/DEPRESSION), DEMOGRAPHICS, THE TWO HEALTH INSURANCE TYPES, AND HEALTH LITERACY. ANALYSES ALSO ASSESSED WHETHER, WITHIN INSURANCE TYPES, HEALTH LITERACY WAS RELATED TO HRQOL. RESULTS: RESULTS SHOWED THAT THOSE WITH CONTRIBUTORY HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE HAD GREATER HEALTH LITERACY THAN THOSE WITH SUBSIDIZED COVERAGE, AND THIS WAS ACCOUNTED FOR BY DIFFERENCES IN EDUCATION AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. HRQOL DID NOT DIFFER BY INSURANCE TYPE. ALTHOUGH LOWER HEALTH LITERACY WAS RELATED TO WORSE HRQOL IN THE OVERALL SAMPLE, IN SUBGROUP ANALYSES LOWER HEALTH LITERACY SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO WORSE HRQOL ONLY AMONG THOSE WITH SUBSIDIZED HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE. CONCLUSION: TARGETING SKILLS WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTH LITERACY, SUCH AS INTERPRETING MEDICAL INFORMATION OR FILLING OUT FORMS, MAY IMPROVE HRQOL, PARTICULARLY IN THOSE WITH SUBSIDIZED INSURANCE COVERAGE.","CENTER FOR TECHNOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, GEISEL SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT DARTMOUTH, NEW HAMPSHIRE, UNITED STATES.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: SMLEMLEY@GMAIL.;COM.; DEPARTAMENTO DE EPIDEMIOLOGA CLNICA Y BIOESTADSTICA, PONTIFICIA UNIVERSIDAD JAVERIANA, BOGOT, COLOMBIA.; CENTER FOR TECHNOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, GEISEL SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT DARTMOUTH, NEW HAMPSHIRE, UNITED STATES; DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY, GEISEL SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT DARTMOUTH, NEW HAMPSHIRE, UNITED STATES.; DEPARTAMENTO DE EPIDEMIOLOGA CLNICA Y BIOESTADSTICA, PONTIFICIA UNIVERSIDAD JAVERIANA, BOGOT, COLOMBIA.; CENTER FOR TECHNOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, GEISEL SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT DARTMOUTH, NEW HAMPSHIRE, UNITED STATES; DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY, GEISEL SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT DARTMOUTH, NEW HAMPSHIRE, UNITED STATES.; DEPARTAMENTO DE PSIQUIATRA Y SALUD MENTAL, PONTIFICIA UNIVERSIDAD JAVERIANA, COLOMBIA.; CENTER FOR TRANSLATION RESEARCH AND IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE, NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH, BETHESDA, MARYLAND, UNITED STATES.; CENTER FOR TECHNOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, GEISEL SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT DARTMOUTH, NEW HAMPSHIRE, UNITED STATES; DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY, GEISEL SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT DARTMOUTH, NEW HAMPSHIRE, UNITED STATES.; DEPARTAMENTO DE EPIDEMIOLOGA CLNICA Y BIOESTADSTICA, PONTIFICIA UNIVERSIDAD JAVERIANA, BOGOT, COLOMBIA; DEPARTAMENTO DE PSIQUIATRA Y SALUD MENTAL, PONTIFICIA UNIVERSIDAD JAVERIANA, COLOMBIA; HOSPITAL UNIVERSITARIO SAN IGNACIO, BOGOT, COLOMBIA.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT 2021.

OBJECTIVE: THE STUDY ASSESSED THE IMPACT OF ACCESS TO CARE, USE OF SERVICES, AND HEALTH LITERACY ON CANCER SCREENING AMONG KOREAN AMERICANS. METHODS: A DESCRIPTIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY OF 377 KOREAN AMERICANS AGE 18 YEARS AND OLDER WAS CONDUCTED WITH A SURVEY AND CONVENIENT SAMPLING IN TEXAS. KEY RESULTS: ALTHOUGH 79% OF THE SAMPLE HAD HEALTH INSURANCE, 32% HAD NEVER VISITED A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER, AND 14% WERE DELAYED IN CARE IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS. ONLY 11.6% WERE CONFIDENT TO COMPLETE MEDICAL FORMS, AND 69.5% HAD LIMITED LEVELS OF CONFIDENCE. CANCER SCREENING COMPLIANCE RATES WERE: MAMMOGRAPHY (50.4% AT AGE 40-54 YEARS; 46.6% AT AGE 55 YEARS AND OLDER), A PAP SMEAR (29.4% AT AGE 21-29 YEARS; 78.4% AT AGE 30-65 YEARS; 72.2% AT AGE 66 YEARS AND OLDER), AND COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING AT AGE 45 YEARS AND OLDER (STOOL TESTS 15.1%; SIGMOIDOSCOPY 27%; COLONOSCOPY 51.3%).

THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO ASSESS THE HEALTH LITERACY STATUS OF THE KURDISH POPULATION IN KURDISTAN PROVINCE, IRAN BASED ON THE NINE CONSTRUCTS OF THE IRANIAN HEALTH LITERACY QUESTIONNAIRE (IHLQ) INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY AND DETERMINE THE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES ON HEALTH LITERACY. METHODS: THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON THE IRANIAN ADULT KURDISH POPULATION LIVING IN THE URBAN AND RURAL AREAS OF KURDISTAN PROVINCE, WILLING TO PARTICIPATE DURING APRIL 2017-SEPTEMBER 2018. DATA WERE COLLECTED USING THE IHLQ. THE SAMPLE SIZE WAS DETERMINED TO BE 980 PEOPLE, WITH 490 IN THE RURAL AREAS AND 490 IN THE URBAN AREAS. THE RESEARCHERS VISITED POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS AT THEIR DOORSTEP, ASKING THEM TO COMPLETE THE QUESTIONNAIRE. THE WILLING PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSISTED IN COMPLETING THE IHLQ IN CASE THEY WERE ILLITERATE; THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS WERE READ BY THE RESEARCHERS TO THE PARTICIPANTS, AND THE RESPONSES WERE RECORDED. RESULTS: ABOUT 50.4% (N=494) OF THE KURDISH POPULATION HAD POOR HEALTH LITERACY, WHILE 34.0% (N=333) HAD AVERAGE HEALTH LITERACY, AND 15.6% (N=153) HAD GOOD HEALTH LITERACY. MEANWHILE, 60.2% OF THE PARTICIPANTS OBTAINED POOR SCORES IN THE CONSTRUCT OF HEALTH INFORMATION ACCESS, AND 74.1% (N=726) OBTAINED POOR SCORES IN THE INDIVIDUAL EMPOWERMENT CONSTRUCT. IN ADDITION, THE ANALYSIS OF THE ADJUSTED MODEL INDICATED THAT EDUCATION LEVEL (LOWEST =7.42; P=0.001) AND IN MALE PARTICIPANTS (=-1.10; P=0.001) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER HEALTH LITERACY. CONCLUSION: ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS, THE INVESTIGATED KURDISH POPULATION MOSTLY HAD AVERAGE OR LOW HEALTH LITERACY.

IT IS UNCLEAR HOWEVER WHETHER THIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH LIMITED HEALTH LITERACY OF PATIENTS. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXPLORE THE HEALTH LITERACY OF PATIENTS WITH NONURGENT CONDITIONS IN AN ED, COMPARE IT WITH THE HEALTH LITERACY OF THE GENERAL POPULATION AND IDENTIFY RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND PATIENTS' VIEWS ON EMERGENCY CARE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ATOTAL OF 448PATIENTS WITH NONURGENT CONDITIONS PARTICIPATED IN ACROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY IN THE ED OF AGERMAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL. RESULTS: THE STUDY SHOWS THAT HEALTH LITERACY OF NONURGENT EMERGENCY PATIENTS IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE HEALTH LITERACY OF THE GERMAN POPULATION. PATIENTS WITH LOWER LEVELS OF HEALTH LITERACY PERCEIVE HIGHER TREATMENT URGENCY, ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS INFORMED ABOUT TREATMENT OPTIONS OTHER THAN THE ED AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO VISIT THE ED OR THE OUTPATIENT WALK-IN PRACTICE FOR ASECOND OPINION AFTER HAVING SEEN THEIR GENERAL PRACTITIONER. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS INDICATE ANEED FOR ACTION TO IMPROVE HEALTH LITERACY IN GERMANY.

DEMOGRAPHIC FEATURES, WEIGHT AND BMI VALUES, COMORBIDITY, MENOPAUSAL STATUS, DURATION AND TYPE OF UI, SOCIOECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS (MARITAL STATUS, EDUCATIONAL LEVEL, LEVEL OF INCOME) AND HLS-EU- Q47 SURVEY RESULTS OF THE TWO GROUPS WERE COMPARED. WE ALSO INVESTIGATED THE REASONS REGARDING THE ACCEPTANCE OR REFUSAL OF SUI SURGERY. RESULTS: AMONG THE PATIENTS WHO WERE OFFERED SURGERY 474% ACCEPTED TO UNDERGO OPERATION. TOTAL HLS-EU-Q47 SCORE WAS 30.04 IN THE GROUP OF PATIENTS WHO ACCEPTED SURGERY AND 23.46 IN THE GROUP WHO REFUSED SURGERY. THE PATIENTS THAT REFUSED SURGERY HAD MORE OFTEN INSUFFICIENT HEALTH LITERACY LEVEL (P=0.001). AN EXCELLENT HEALTH LITERACY LEVEL WAS HIGHER FOR PATIENTS WHO AGREED TO ANTI-INCONTINENCE SURGERY (P=0.021). CONCLUSIONS: HEALTH LITERACY SCORE OF PATIENTS WITH URINARY INCONTINENCE (UI) WHO REFUSED SURGERY WAS LOWER THAN THOSE WHO ACCEPTED SURGERY.

TO DETERMINE HOW US AND CANADIAN PHARMACY SCHOOLS INCLUDE CONTENT RELATED TO HEALTH DISPARITIES AND CULTURAL COMPETENCE AND HEALTH LITERACY IN CURRICULUM AS WELL AS TO REVIEW ASSESSMENT PRACTICES.METHODS. A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY WAS DISTRIBUTED TO 143 ACCREDITED AND CANDIDATE-STATUS PHARMACY PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES AND 10 IN CANADA IN THREE PHASES. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED TO ASSESS INTER-INSTITUTIONAL VARIABILITY AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS AND SURVEY RESULTS.RESULTS. AFTER STRATIFICATION BY INSTITUTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE 72 (50%) RESPONDING INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE EIGHT (80%) IN CANADA. A CORE GROUP OF FACULTY TYPICALLY TAUGHT HEALTH DISPARITIES AND CULTURAL COMPETENCE CONTENT AND/OR HEALTH LITERACY. HEALTH DISPARITIES AND CULTURAL COMPETENCE WAS PRIMARILY TAUGHT IN MULTIPLE COURSES ACROSS MULTIPLE YEARS IN THE PRE-APPE CURRICULUM. WHILE HEALTH LITERACY WAS PRIMARILY TAUGHT IN MULTIPLE COURSES IN ONE YEAR IN THE PRE-APPE CURRICULUM IN CANADA (75.0%), DELIVERY OF HEALTH LITERACY WAS MORE VARIED IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING IN A SINGLE COURSE (20.0%), MULTIPLE COURSES IN ONE YEAR (17.1%), AND MULTIPLE COURSES IN MULTIPLE YEARS (48.6%). HEALTH DISPARITIES AND CULTURAL COMPETENCE AND HEALTH LITERACY WAS MOSTLY TAUGHT AT THE INTRODUCTION OR REINFORCEMENT LEVEL.

LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE ROLE OF HEALTH LITERACY-SENSITIVE COMMUNICATION IN COMPLEX CARE STRUCTURES. THEREFORE, OUR AIM WAS TO ASSESS WHICH HOSPITAL CHARACTERISTICS (IN TERMS OF PROCESS ORGANIZATION) AND PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS (E.G., AGE, CHRONIC ILLNESS, ETC.) CONTRIBUTE TO BETTER PERCEPTIONS OF HEALTH LITERACY-SENSITIVE COMMUNICATION, AS WELL AS WHETHER BETTER HEALTH LITERACY-SENSITIVE COMMUNICATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER PATIENT REPORTED EXPERIENCES. DATA WERE DERIVED FROM A PATIENT SURVEY CONDUCTED IN 2020 IN FOUR CLINICAL DEPARTMENTS OF A UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL IN GERMANY. HEALTH LITERACY-SENSITIVE COMMUNICATION WAS MEASURED WITH THE HL-COM SCALE. DATA FROM 209 PATIENTS (RESPONSE RATE 24.2%) WERE ANALYZED WITH A STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODEL (SEM). RESULTS REVEALED THAT NO PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HL-COM SCORES. BETTER PROCESS ORGANIZATION AS PERCEIVED BY PATIENTS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER HL-COM SCORES, AND, IN TURN, BETTER HL-COM SCORES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH MORE PATIENT-REPORTED SOCIAL SUPPORT PROVIDED BY PHYSICIANS AND NURSES AS WELL AS FEWER UNMET INFORMATION NEEDS. INVESTING INTO GOOD PROCESS ORGANIZATION MIGHT IMPROVE HEALTH LITERACY-SENSITIVE COMMUNICATION, WHICH IN TURN HAS THE POTENTIAL TO FOSTER THE PATIENT-PROVIDER RELATIONSHIP AS WELL AS TO REDUCE UNMET INFORMATION NEEDS OF PATIENTS.","DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH, UNIVERSITY OF OLDENBURG, 26129 OLDENBURG, GERMANY.; DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH, UNIVERSITY OF OLDENBURG, 26129 OLDENBURG, GERMANY.; CENTER FOR HEALTH COMMUNICATION AND HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH (CHSR), DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOSOMATIC MEDICINE AND PSYCHOTHERAPY, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL BONN, 53127 BONN, GERMANY.; GERMAN CANCER SOCIETY (DKG), 14057 BERLIN, GERMANY.; DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH, UNIVERSITY OF OLDENBURG, 26129 OLDENBURG, GERMANY.; DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH, UNIVERSITY OF OLDENBURG, 26129 OLDENBURG, GERMANY.;","ORCID: 0000-0002-4315-1816 ORCID: 0000-0001-6174-4909 ORCID: 0000-0002-7438-4321",NA,"THE AUTHORS DECLARE NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST.

EXISTING LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT THIS IS THE CASE SINCE A POSITIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE LEVEL OF HEALTH LITERACY AND THE LEVEL OF TRUST IN PHYSICIANS AND THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM HAS BEEN SHOWN. THIS STUDY AIMS TO CHALLENGE THIS ASSUMPTION. METHODS: BASED ON THEORETICAL ARGUMENTS FROM GAME THEORY AND ANALYSIS OF EMPIRICAL DATA, WE ARGUE THAT THE ASSOCIATION IS BETTER DESCRIBED AS AN INVERSELY U-SHAPED CURVE, SUGGESTING THAT LOW AND HIGH LEVELS OF HEALTH LITERACY LEAD TO A LOWER LEVEL OF TRUST THAN A MEDIUM LEVEL OF HEALTH LITERACY DOES. THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS IS BASED ON A STUDY OF THE DANES' RELATIONSHIP TO THE OVERALL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. MORE THAN 6000 DANES HAVE BEEN ASKED ABOUT THEIR OVERALL EXPECTATIONS OF THE HEALTH SERVICE, THEIR CONCRETE EXPERIENCES AND THEIR ATTITUDES TO A NUMBER OF CHANGE INITIATIVES. RESULTS: GAME THEORY ANALYSIS SHOW THAT THE COMBINED PERCEIVED COOPERATION AND BENEFIT EFFECTS CAN EXPLAIN AN INVERSELY U-SHAPED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIAL GROUPS AND TRUST IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. BASED ON QUANTITATIVE, BINARY REGRESSION ANALYSES OF EMPIRICAL DATA, THE LOWEST DEGREE OF TRUST IS FOUND AMONG PATIENTS FROM THE LOWEST AND HIGHEST SOCIAL GROUPS, WHILE THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF TRUST IS FOUND IN THE MIDDLE GROUP. THE MAIN DRIVER FOR THIS RESULT IS THAT WHILE PATIENTS HAVING LOW HEALTH LITERACY PERCEIVE THAT THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS NOT COOPERATIVE, PATIENTS WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF HEALTH LITERACY HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE QUALITY, WHICH THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. THIS REDUCES THE PERCEIVED BENEFIT FROM THEIR ENCOUNTER WITH THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. CONCLUSION: IT IS IMPORTANT THAT HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS UNDERSTAND THAT SOME PATIENT GROUPS HAVE A HIGHER CHANCE OF COOPERATION (E.G., AGREEING ON THE CHOICE OF TREATMENT) OR DEFECTION (E.G. PASSING A COMPLAINT) THAN OTHERS. IN PERSPECTIVE, FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD UNDERTAKE FURTHER QUALITATIVE EXAMINATIONS OF POSSIBLE PATIENT TYPES AND THEIR DEMANDS IN RELATION TO DIFFERENT HEALTH CARE SECTORS, FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON THE OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THE HANDLING OF DIFFERENT PATIENT TYPES.","DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, UNIT FOR HEALTH PROMOTION RESEARCH, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN DENMARK, ESBJERG, DENMARK.; MBERTRAM@HEALTH.;SDU.;DK.; DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND BUSINESS ECONOMIC, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN DENMARK, ESBJERG, DENMARK.; DEPARTMENT FOR PLANNING AND FINANCES, ODENSE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, ODENSE, DENMARK.; DEPARTMENT OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, AARHUS UNIVERSITY, AARHUS, DENMARK.;","ORCID: 0000-0003-1398-5059"," 2021.

HEALTH LITERACY PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN PROMOTING HEALTHY BEHAVIOUR AND THEREBY MAINTAINING GOOD HEALTH. THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE ROLE OF HEALTH LITERACY IN THE GEMUKI (ACRONYM FOR 'GEMEINSAM GESUND: VORSORGE PLUS FR MUTTER UND KIND'-STRENGTHENING HEALTH PROMOTION: ENHANCED CHECK-UP VISITS FOR MOTHER AND CHILD) PROJECT. IT WILL ASSESS THE ABILITY OF THE GEMUKI LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION TO POSITIVELY AFFECT HEALTH LITERACY LEVELS THROUGH ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN PREVENTIVE COUNSELLING. THE STUDY ALSO EXPLORES ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY, HEALTH OUTCOMES, HEALTH SERVICE USE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERVENTION. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: THE GEMUKI TRIAL HAS A HYBRID EFFECTIVENESS-IMPLEMENTATION DESIGN AND IS CARRIED OUT IN ROUTINE PRENATAL HEALTH SERVICE SETTINGS IN GERMANY. WOMEN (N=1860) ARE RECRUITED BY THEIR GYNAECOLOGIST DURING ROUTINE CHECK-UP VISITS BEFORE 12 WEEKS OF GESTATION. TRAINED HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS CARRY OUT COUNSELLING USING MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING TECHNIQUES TO POSITIVELY AFFECT HEALTH LITERACY AND LIFESTYLE-RELATED RISK FACTORS. HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS (GYNAECOLOGISTS AND MIDWIVES) AND WOMEN JOINTLY AGREE ON SPECIFIC, MEASURABLE, ACHIEVABLE REASONABLE, TIME-BOUND GOALS. WOMEN WILL BE INVITED TO FILL IN QUESTIONNAIRES AT TWO TIME POINTS (AT RECRUITMENT AND 37TH-40TH WEEK OF GESTATION) USING AN APP. HEALTH LITERACY IS MEASURED USING THE GERMAN VERSION OF THE HEALTH LITERACY SURVEY-16 AND THE BRIEF HEALTH LITERACY SCREENER. LIFESTYLE IS MEASURED WITH QUESTIONS ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, NUTRITION, ALCOHOL AND DRUG USE. HEALTH OUTCOMES OF BOTH MOTHER AND CHILD, INCLUDING GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN (GWG) WILL BE DOCUMENTED AT EACH ROUTINE VISIT. HEALTH SERVICE USE WILL BE ASSESSED USING SOCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE CLAIMS DATA. DATA ANALYSES WILL BE CONDUCTED USING IBM SPSS STATISTICS, VERSION 26.0. THESE INCLUDE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS, TESTS AND REGRESSION MODELS. A MEDIATION MODEL WILL BE CONDUCTED TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WHETHER HEALTH BEHAVIOUR MEDIATES THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY AND GWG.

OBJECTIVES: WE SOUGHT TO EXAMINE HEALTH LITERACY OVER TIME AMONG OLDER ADULTS USING THREE WIDELY USED MEASURES. DESIGN: A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. PARTICIPANTS: COMMUNITY-DWELLING ADULTS AGES 55 TO 74 AT BASELINE WITH AT LEAST ONE FOLLOW-UP VISIT (N = 656) RECRUITED FROM ONE ACADEMIC INTERNAL MEDICINE CLINIC AND SIX COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS IN CHICAGO, IL. MEASURES: HEALTH LITERACY WAS MEASURED USING THE TEST OF FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY IN ADULTS (TOFHLA), NEWEST VITAL SIGN (NVS), AND RAPID ESTIMATE OF ADULT LITERACY IN MEDICINE (REALM) AT BASELINE AND UP TO THREE FOLLOW-UP TIME POINTS. RESULTS: IN UNADJUSTED ANALYSES, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES SINCE BASELINE WERE FOUND BEGINNING AT THE SECOND FOLLOW-UP (MEAN (M) = 6.0 YEARS, SD = 0.6) FOR THE TOFHLA (M = - 0.9, SD = 0.95, P = 0.049) AND THE REALM (M = 0.3, SD = 2.5, P = 0.004) AND AT THE LAST FOLLOW-UP (M = 8.6 YEARS, SD = 0.5) FOR THE NVS (M = - 0.2, SD = 1.4, P = 0.02). THERE WERE NON-LINEAR EFFECTS OF BASELINE AGE ON TOFHLA AND NVS SCORES OVER TIME (PIECEWISE CUBIC SPLINE P = 0.01 AND P < 0.001, RESPECTIVELY) AND NO EFFECT ON REALM SCORES (B = 0.02, 95% CI - 0.01 TO 0.04, P = 0.17) USING MULTIVARIABLE MIXED-EFFECTS LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS, CONTROLLING FOR RACE, EDUCATION, INCOME, AND COMORBIDITY. CONCLUSION: WE FOUND A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AGE AND HEALTH LITERACY OVER TIME AS MEASURED BY THE TOFHLA AND NVS. HEALTH LITERACY BARRIERS APPEAR TO BE MORE PREVALENT AMONG INDIVIDUALS IN LATER LIFE, WHEN SELF-CARE DEMANDS ARE SIMILARLY INCREASING. CLINICIANS MIGHT CONSIDER STRATEGIES TO ASSESS AND RESPOND TO LIMITED HEALTH LITERACY, PARTICULARLY AMONG PATIENTS 70 AND OLDER. REALM PERFORMANCE REMAINED STABLE OVER 10 YEARS OF FOLLOW-UP. THIS QUESTIONS WHETHER HEALTH LITERACY TOOLS MEASURE THE SAME ATTRIBUTE.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE IF AN EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION THAT COMBINED ICC AND HL WAS EFFECTIVE AT CHANGING SECOND-YEAR NURSING STUDENTS' SELF-EFFICACY, BELIEFS, AND KNOWLEDGE. A TOTAL OF 157 SECOND-YEAR NURSING STUDENTS IN TWO DIFFERENT PROGRAMS PARTICIPATED IN PRE- AND POST-SURVEYS CONSISTING OF THE TRANSCULTURAL SELF-EFFICACY TOOL AND HEALTH LITERACY BELIEFS AND KNOWLEDGE SURVEY. STUDENTS ATTENDED A TWO-PART LECTURE WITH A MODERATED PANEL ON ICC AND HEALTH LITERACY AND BEGAN CLINICAL FIELDWORK. RESULTS WERE ANALYZED USING WILCOXON SIGNED-RANK TEST AND PEARSON CORRELATION. THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN ALL ICC SUBSCALES AFTER AN EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION AND CLINICAL FIELDWORK (COGNITIVE Z = 7.681, P < .001; PRACTICAL Z = 7.319, P < .001; AFFECTIVE Z = 6.533, P < .001).

THE EUROPEAN HEALTH LITERACY SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE (HLS-EU-Q- 47 ITEMS) WAS APPLIED TO 530 PATIENTS WHO PRESENTED TO CARDIOLOGY POLYCLINICS OF A UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL IN ANKARA. CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS, UNIVARIATE AND MULTI-LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSES WERE USED IN THE STUDY. DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH LITERACY WERE SEX, EDUCATION LEVEL, PLACE OF RESIDENCE AND PERCEPTION OF SOCIAL STATUS (P <.05). ALTHOUGH ADJUSTMENTS WERE MADE BASED ON RELEVANT CONTROL VARIABLES IN MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES, HEALTH LITERACY WAS FOUND TO AFFECT 14 OF 26 PATIENT OUTCOMES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY (P <.05). HIGHER EDUCATION LEVEL AND PERCEPTION OF SOCIAL STATUS, RESIDING IN THE CITY CENTER AND BEING FEMALE WERE AMONG THE DETERMINANTS OF HIGH HEALTH LITERACY.

IN COMBINATION WITH A CHRONIC ILLNESS, THESE DEMOGRAPHICS LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO HEALTHCARE FOR PATIENTS WITH SCD, LEAVING THEM EXCEPTIONALLY VULNERABLE WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THIS UNIQUE VULNERABILITY IS ESPECIALLY NOTABLE WHEN TRANSITIONING ADOLESCENTS WITH SCD FROM PEDIATRIC TO ADULT CARE, AS THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT TIME OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY FOR THESE PATIENTS. IT IS POSTULATED THAT HEALTH LITERACY INFLUENCES TRANSITION FROM PEDIATRIC TO ADULT CARE IN ADOLESCENTS WITH SCD. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THIS RELATIONSHIP, MORE ADOLESCENT HEALTH LITERACY RESEARCH MUST BE CONDUCTED WITH BOTH ADOLESCENTS WITH AND WITHOUT SCD. THEREFORE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO SYSTEMATICALLY COMPARE HEALTH LITERACY IN ADOLESCENTS WITH AND WITHOUT SCD. DESIGN AND METHODS: THIS IS A CROSS-SECTIONAL, DESCRIPTIVE, EXPLORATORY STUDY. ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-FOUR ADOLESCENTS WITH SCD AND 105 ADOLESCENTS WITHOUT SCD WERE RECRUITED FOR THIS STUDY. THE NEWEST VITAL SIGN (NVS) HEALTH LITERACY INSTRUMENT WAS USED TO EVALUATE HEALTH LITERACY. PEARSON CORRELATIONS WERE CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG HEALTH LITERACY AND THE INFLUENCING FACTORS OF AGE, GRADE LEVEL, INCOME, AND PARENTAL EDUCATION LEVEL. DIFFERENCES IN NVS SCORES BETWEEN GROUPS WERE ASSESSED USING INDEPENDENT SAMPLES T TESTS. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY, AGE (R=.286, P<.01) AND GRADE LEVEL (R=.317, P=.00) IN ADOLESCENTS WITH SCD. IN ADOLESCENTS WITHOUT SCD, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEALTH LITERACY, INCOME (R=.235; P<.05) AND PARENTAL EDUCATION (R=.263; P<.01). THE MEAN NVS SCORE WAS 2.66 FOR ADOLESCENTS WITH SCD AND 3.77 FOR ADOLESCENTS WITHOUT SCD. A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN NVS SCORES WAS FOUND BETWEEN GROUPS (T=4.772; P<.001). ADOLESCENTS WITH SCD DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NVS SCORES THAN ADOLESCENTS WITHOUT SCD. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN HEALTH LITERACY SCORES AND INFLUENCING FACTORS IN ADOLESCENTS WITH AND WITHOUT SCD. THUS, THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES UNIQUE INSIGHT FOR NURSES AS THEY DESIGN, IMPLEMENT AND EVALUATE HEALTH PROMOTION, PATIENT EDUCATION, AND FUTURE RESEARCH INITIATIVES FOR ADOLESCENTS AND FAMILIES, BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT SCD.

GROWING LITERATURE ON HEALTH LITERACY DESCRIBES IT AS A CONCEPT NOT SOLELY RELIANT ON INDIVIDUAL CAPABILITIES BUT ALSO ON ORGANIZATIONS' ABILITY TO MAKE HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION AND SERVICES EQUITABLY ACCESSIBLE AND COMPREHENSIBLE. PROGRAM: THE US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (HHS) UPDATES THE HEALTHY PEOPLE OBJECTIVES EACH DECADE BASED ON THE MOST CURRENT SCIENCE. FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HEALTHY PEOPLE 2030, HHS DREW ON RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE SECRETARY'S ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL HEALTH PROMOTION AND DISEASE PREVENTION OBJECTIVES FOR 2030 (SECRETARY'S ADVISORY COMMITTEE), AN INDEPENDENT ADVISORY COMMITTEE OF NATIONAL HEALTH EXPERTS, TO UPDATE THE 20-YEAR OLD INDIVIDUAL-FOCUSED HEALTHY PEOPLE DEFINITION OF HEALTH LITERACY. HHS SOLICITED INPUT FROM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND USERS ON THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO THAT DEFINITION. IMPLEMENTATION: HHS PUBLISHED A FEDERAL REGISTER NOTICE TO SOLICIT PUBLIC COMMENTS, WHICH WERE QUALITATIVELY ANALYZED BY GOVERNMENT STAFF. EVALUATION: THE 2 SEPARATE ANALYSES REVEALED PLURALITY SUPPORT FOR IMPROVING THE DEFINITION TO FOCUS ON BOTH INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL ROLES IN HEALTH LITERACY. RESULTS LED HHS SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS TO UPDATE THE DEFINITION TO INCLUDE DEFINITIONS OF PERSONAL HEALTH LITERACY AND ORGANIZATIONAL HEALTH LITERACY. HEALTHY PEOPLE 2030'S EXPANDED HEALTH LITERACY DEFINITION REFLECTS THE MOST CURRENT SCIENCE AND INPUT FROM THE SECRETARY'S ADVISORY COMMITTEE, PUBLIC COMMENTS, AND HHS SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS. DISCUSSION: THE UPDATED DEFINITION IS INTENDED TO ADVANCE HEALTHY PEOPLE 2030'S HEALTH LITERACY GOALS PARTICULARLY AS MORE ORGANIZATIONS IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND OTHER SECTORS ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR ROLE IN THE DELIVERY OF QUALITY HEALTH INFORMATION AND SERVICES.","OFFICE OF DISEASE PREVENTION AND HEALTH PROMOTION, OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR HEALTH, OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY, US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (MS SANTANA, MS OCHIAI, MS BLAKEY, AND MS BEVINGTON AND DR HARRIS [RETIRED]); AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY, ROCKVILLE, MARYLAND (MS BRACH); AND SECRETARY'S ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL HEALTH PROMOTION AND DISEASE PREVENTION OBJECTIVES FOR 2030, WASHINGTON, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA (DRS KLEINMAN [RETIRED] AND PRONK [RETIRED]).;",NA,NA,"THE AUTHORS DECLARE NO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.",NA,"2021/03/17 12:28","20211101",NA,2021,"2021/03/18 06:00",NA,"HS999999/IMAHRQ/INTRAMURAL AHRQ HHS/UNITED STATES","SUPPL 6","1550-5022 (ELECTRONIC) 1078-4659 (PRINT) 1078-4659 (LINKING)","9505213","JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE : JPHMP","ENG","10.1097/PHH.0000000000001324 [DOI]","20211101","2021/11/03 06:00","NIHMS1696595",NA,NA,NA,"NLM","S258-S264",NA,"PMC8435055",NA,"33729194","PPUBLISH",NA,NA,NA,"J PUBLIC HEALTH MANAG PRACT. 2021 NOV-DEC 01;27(SUPPL 6):S258-S264.

(2) METHOD: THIS STUDY AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HB, HL MEASURED IN COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH LITERACY (CHL) AND FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY (FHL), HPS PROGRAMS, AND SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS AMONG HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN SURABAYA, INDONESIA. A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED, AND 1066 STUDENTS WERE EVALUATED AS RESPONDENTS. (3) RESULT: THE RESULTS OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES SHOWED THAT FOLLOWING FACTORS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER HEALTH BEHAVIOR: FEMALE, BETTER ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE, HIGHER GRADE, HIGHER FATHER'S EDUCATION, LOWER ALLOWANCE, AND BETTER CHL AND FHL. THE STRONGEST ASSOCIATION FOR HB WAS GENDER. CHL WAS ESPECIALLY ASSOCIATED WITH HANDWASHING, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND DRUG ABUSE. FHL WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SMOKING AND DRUG ABUSE. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HPS PROGRAMS DID NOT REACH AN OPTIMUM LEVEL AND ONLY INFLUENCED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY.

THIS STUDY OPERATIONALIZES THE MAIN ASPECTS OF CRITICAL HEALTH LITERACY. IT CALLS FOR SPECIFIC EDUCATIONAL AND TRAINING INITIATIVES IN THE FIELD. MOREOVER, IT ARGUES IN FAVOR OF BROADENING THE CURRENT EDUCATIONAL CURRICULA TO EMPOWER INDIVIDUALS TO ENGAGE IN INFORMED AND QUALITY DECISION MAKING. STRENGTHENING INDIVIDUALS' CRITICAL HEALTH LITERACY INVOLVES INTERVENTIONS TO EMPOWER IN ARGUMENT EVALUATION.

USING MULTIVARIABLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSES, WE ASSESSED HOW LANGUAGE AND HEALTH LITERACY IMPACT HEALTH INFORMATION-SEEKING EXPERIENCES (CONFIDENCE, EFFORT, FRUSTRATION, QUALITY CONCERNS, AND DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING INFORMATION), ADJUSTING FOR AGE, GENDER, RACE/ETHNICITY, EDUCATION, USUAL PLACE OF CARE, HEALTH STATUS, INFORMATION-SEEKING BEHAVIORS, AND SMARTPHONE OWNERSHIP. RESULTS: OF 1000 PARTICIPANTS (487 ENGLISH-SPEAKING, 256 SPANISH-SPEAKING, 257 CHINESE-SPEAKING), 820 (82%) REPORTED AT LEAST ONE NEGATIVE HEALTH INFORMATION-SEEKING EXPERIENCE. CHINESE-LANGUAGE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH FRUSTRATION (AOR=2.56; 1.12-5.86). DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING INFORMATION WAS MORE LIKELY IN SPANISH-LANGUAGE RESPONDENTS (AOR=3.58; 1.25-10.24).

SELF-CARE BEHAVIOR HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN CHRONIC DISEASES, AND ADEQUATE SELF-CARE BEHAVIOR MAY MITIGATE ADVERSE OUTCOMES. HEALTH LITERACY MAY BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR ASSOCIATED WITH SELF-CARE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DIFFERENT DOMAINS OF SELF-CARE BEHAVIOR AND HEALTH LITERACY IN PATIENTS WITH CKD. THIS STUDY ENROLLED 208 PATIENTS WITH CKD STAGES 1-5 WHO WERE NOT UNDERGOING RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY AT KAOHSIUNG MEDICAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL FROM APRIL 2019 TO JANUARY 2020. HEALTH LITERACY WAS MEASURED USING A MULTIDIMENSIONAL HEALTH LITERACY QUESTIONNAIRE COVERING THE FOLLOWING FIVE DIMENSIONS: ACCESSING, UNDERSTANDING, APPRAISING, AND APPLYING HEALTH INFORMATION, AND COMMUNICATION/INTERACTION. THE CKD SELF-CARE SCALE, WHICH IS A 16-ITEM QUESTIONNAIRE WITH FIVE DOMAINS INCLUDING MEDICATION ADHERENCE, DIET CONTROL, EXERCISE, SMOKING BEHAVIOR, AND HOME BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING WAS USED TO ASSESS SELF-CARE BEHAVIOR. AMONG THE 208 PATIENTS, 97 HAD SUFFICIENT OR EXCELLENT HEALTH LITERACY, AND 111 HAD INADEQUATE OR LIMITED/PROBLEMATIC HEALTH LITERACY.

OBJECTIVES: THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY ASSESSED THE LEVELS AND CORRELATES OF HEALTH LITERACY IN LEBANESE ADULTS. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 587 PARTICIPANTS (54.5% WOMEN) WERE RECRUITED FROM THE OUTPATIENT CLINICS OF FIVE HEALTH FACILITIES IN BEIRUT. THE QUESTIONNAIRE CONSISTED OF THE ARABIC VERSION OF THE FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY SCALE, THE ARABIC SHORT VERSION OF THE EUROPEAN HEALTH LITERACY SURVEY, AND QUESTIONS ON SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND HEALTH-RELATED FACTORS. DESCRIPTIVE AND INFERENTIAL STATISTICS WERE PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE ASSOCIATION OF THESE FACTORS WITH FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY (FHL) AND COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH LITERACY (CHL) LEVELS. KEY RESULTS: ABOUT 65.8% HAD INADEQUATE OR PROBLEMATIC FHL AND 43.8% HAD INADEQUATE OR PROBLEMATIC CHL. ALTHOUGH FHL WAS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH LONG-TERM ILLNESS, IT WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH ABILITY TO PAY AND HEALTH STATUS. CHL WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH EDUCATION, INCOME, ABILITY TO PAY FOR TREATMENT, HEALTH STATUS, AND FHL LEVEL, WHEREAS IT WAS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH LONG-TERM ILLNESS. BINARY LOGISTIC REGRESSION SHOWED THAT LOW EDUCATION, LOW SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, AND BEING A WIDOW WERE PREDICTIVE OF INADEQUATE FHL. MOREOVER, HAVING INADEQUATE FHL AND LOW INCOME INCREASED THE LIKELIHOOD OF HAVING INADEQUATE CHL. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY HAS IDENTIFIED THOSE WITH RISK FACTORS FOR INADEQUATE HEALTH LITERACY AND UNFAVORABLE HEALTH OUTCOMES. A NATIONAL ACTION PLAN CAN GUIDE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH LITERACY AND ITS EMBEDDEDNESS IN SOCIETY TO INSTILL COMPETENCIES AND THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WOULD ELIMINATE HEALTH INEQUITIES AND SUSTAIN HEALTH IN LEBANON.

THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT HEALTH LITERACY IMPACTS THE HEALTH OUTCOMES OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASES, BUT DETAILED INFORMATION ON THIS TOPIC IN PATIENTS WITH LIVER CIRRHOSIS IS SCARCE. IT WAS THE AIM OF THIS STUDY TO IDENTIFY RISK FACTORS FOR POORER HEALTH LITERACY IN PATIENTS WITH LIVER CIRRHOSIS. METHODS: 89 PATIENTS WITH LIVER CIRRHOSIS WERE ENROLLED IN THIS STUDY AND HEALTH LITERACY WAS MEASURED USING THE HEALTH LITERACY QUESTIONNAIRE (HLQ). COVERT HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY (CHE) WAS DIAGNOSED CLINICALLY ACCORDING TO THE WEST-HAVEN CRITERIA (HE GRADE 1) AND THE PHES (MINIMAL HE). DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS WERE ASSESSED USING THE HAMILTON DEPRESSION RATING SCALE (HDRS). BASED ON THE NINE SUBSCALES OF THE HLQ, RISK FACTORS FOR POOR HEALTH LITERACY WERE IDENTIFIED USING LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS. RESULTS: NORMALIZED HLQ SCORES RANGED BETWEEN 65-76%, WHILE APPRAISAL OF HEALTH INFORMATION HAD LOWEST SCORE (65%) AND ABILITY TO ACTIVELY ENGAGE WITH HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS HAD HIGHEST SCORE (76%). MULTIVARIABLE REGRESSION ANALYSES REVEALED AN ASSOCIATION OF POORER HEALTH LITERACY AND LIVER FUNCTION AS DETERMINED BY MELD SCORE AND COMPLICATIONS OF LIVER CIRRHOSIS SUCH AS A HISTORY OF ASCITES OR CHE. ADDITIONALLY, WE IDENTIFIED MODIFIABLE OR PREVENTABLE FACTORS SUCH AS DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, A HISTORY OF FALLS, AND ACTIVE SMOKING AS RISK FACTORS FOR POORER HEALTH LITERACY. CONCLUSION: MULTIPLE FACTORS SEEM TO IMPACT ON HEALTH LITERACY IN PATIENTS WITH LIVER CIRRHOSIS.

WE DESCRIBE AN INNOVATIVE METHODOLOGY DESIGNED TO OPTIMIZE USER UNDERSTANDING OF PATIENT MEDICATION LABELING THROUGH THE SYSTEMATIC APPLICATION OF EVIDENCE-BASED HEALTH LITERACY PRINCIPLES, USING THE PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT (PPI) FOR BEZLOTOXUMAB (ZINPLAVA, MERCK & CO., INC., KENILWORTH, NJ, USA) AS AN EXAMPLE. METHODS: WE USED A MIXED-MODEL, ITERATIVE APPROACH CONSISTING OF THREE PHASES: (1) CONTENT DEVELOPMENT; (2) FOCUS GROUP TESTING; AND (3) COMPREHENSION TESTING. CONTENT DEVELOPMENT WAS BASED ON EVIDENCE-BASED HEALTH LITERACY PRINCIPLES AND CONDUCTED THROUGH A COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN INDUSTRY AND ACADEMIA PROFESSIONALS. THE PPI WAS THEN TESTED IN FOUR FOCUS GROUPS, TWO IN ATLANTA AND TWO IN CHICAGO, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON COLLECTING FEEDBACK FROM RESPONDENTS WITH LIMITED HEALTH LITERACY, EVALUATED USING THE NEWEST VITAL SIGN (NVS) HEALTH LITERACY ASSESSMENT TOOL. SUBSEQUENT COMPREHENSION TESTING INCLUDED PATIENTS WITH C. DIFF, CAREGIVERS, AND GENERAL POPULATION MEMBERS, WITH A PRE-DEFINED TARGET SAMPLE OF 25% WITH LIMITED HEALTH LITERACY IDENTIFIED THROUGH TWO HEALTH LITERACY ASSESSMENT TOOLS: THE SINGLE ITEM LITERACY SCREENER AND THE NVS. RESULTS: CONTENT DEVELOPMENT OF THE BEZLOTOXUMAB PPI OCCURRED IN MAY 2015. IN JUNE 2015, FOCUS GROUP RESPONDENTS (N=34) PROVIDED GENERALLY FAVORABLE FEEDBACK, WITH INSIGHTS REVOLVING AROUND ORGANIZATION AND USABILITY; LANGUAGE AND COMPREHENSION; AND VOLUME OF INFORMATION. COMPREHENSION TESTING OF THE REVISED PPI RESULTED IN AVERAGE COMPREHENSION SCORES OF 96% FOR THE OVERALL POPULATION (N=59), 90% FOR INDIVIDUALS PRESENTING WITH LIMITED HEALTH LITERACY (N=14), AND 97% FOR THOSE WITH ADEQUATE HEALTH LITERACY (N=45). THIS PPI DEVELOPMENT APPROACH WAS SIMILARLY EFFECTIVE FOR SUBSEQUENT PRODUCTS ACROSS DIVERSE THERAPEUTIC AREAS, WITH COMPREHENSION SCORES86% FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS (N=1197). CONCLUSION: THIS METHODOLOGY REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF UNDERSTANDABLE PATIENT MEDICATION LABELING, ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE WITH LIMITED HEALTH LITERACY.","ROLLINS SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH OF EMORY UNIVERSITY, 1518 CLIFTON ROAD NE, ATLANTA, GA, 30322, USA.; KLJACOB@EMORY.;EDU.; SOMMER CONSULTING, LANGHORNE, PA, USA.; MERCK & CO.;, INC.;, KENILWORTH, NJ, USA.; MERCK & CO.;, INC.;, KENILWORTH, NJ, USA.; MERCK & CO.;, INC.;, KENILWORTH, NJ, USA.; ORGANON & CO.;, JERSEY CITY, NJ, USA.; MERCK & CO.;, INC.;, KENILWORTH, NJ, USA.; MERCK & CO.;, INC.;, KENILWORTH, NJ, USA.; MERCK & CO.;, INC.;, KENILWORTH, NJ, USA.; MERCK & CO.;, INC.;, KENILWORTH, NJ, USA.; MERCK & CO.;, INC.;, KENILWORTH, NJ, USA.; FEINBERG SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY, CHICAGO, IL, USA.;",NA," 2021.

TOOLS THAT POSITIVELY IMPACT HEALTH LITERACY THEREFORE HAVE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. INPATIENT PORTALS ARE A TOOL THAT PROVIDES PATIENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CULTIVATE HEALTH LITERACY SKILLS DURING HOSPITALIZATION. OUR STUDY INVESTIGATED HOW INPATIENT PORTAL USE COULD IMPACT ATTRIBUTES OF HEALTH LITERACY. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH 132 PATIENTS AND 440 CARE TEAM MEMBERS TO LEARN ABOUT PATIENTS' INPATIENT PORTAL USE. INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS WERE ANALYZED DEDUCTIVELY AND INDUCTIVELY TO CATEGORIZE DATA AND UNDERSTAND EMERGENT THEMES AROUND HEALTH LITERACY. RESULTS: PATIENTS AND CARE TEAM MEMBERS IDENTIFIED INPATIENT PORTAL FUNCTIONS THAT THEY PERCEIVED TO POSITIVELY IMPACT HEALTH LITERACY. THESE FUNCTIONS INCLUDED PROVIDING PATIENTS ACCESS TO HEALTH INFORMATION, CARE PLANS, AND EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS, AS WELL AS ENABLING PATIENT COMMUNICATION WITH THEIR CARE TEAM. CONCLUSION: RECOGNIZING THE POTENTIAL OF INPATIENT PORTALS TO IMPROVE HEALTH LITERACY IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE THEY ARE IMPLEMENTED IN WAYS THAT LEVERAGE THIS BENEFIT FOR PATIENTS. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD IMPLEMENT INPATIENT PORTALS THAT INCLUDE FEATURES THAT SUPPORT HEALTH LITERACY AND ENCOURAGE PATIENTS TO USE THESE PORTALS IN WAYS THAT IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH LITERACY SKILLS.","CATALYST, CENTER FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF TEAM SCIENCE, ANALYTICS, AND SYSTEMS THINKING, COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OHIO, USA.; ELECTRONIC ADDRESS: SARAH.;MACEWAN@OSUMC.;EDU.; CATALYST, CENTER FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF TEAM SCIENCE, ANALYTICS, AND SYSTEMS THINKING, COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OHIO, USA.; CATALYST, CENTER FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF TEAM SCIENCE, ANALYTICS, AND SYSTEMS THINKING, COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OHIO, USA; DIVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES MANAGEMENT AND POLICY, COLLEGE OF PUBLIC HEALTH, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OHIO, USA.; CATALYST, CENTER FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF TEAM SCIENCE, ANALYTICS, AND SYSTEMS THINKING, COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OHIO, USA; DIVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES MANAGEMENT AND POLICY, COLLEGE OF PUBLIC HEALTH, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OHIO, USA; DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY AND COMMUNITY MEDICINE, COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OHIO, USA; DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS, COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OHIO, USA.;",NA,"COPYRIGHT 2020 ELSEVIER B.V.

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED DECLINING FINANCIAL AND HEALTH LITERACY IN RELATION TO DECISION MAKING PERFORMANCE, SCAM SUSCEPTIBILITY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING. DESIGN: LONGITUDINAL STUDY. SETTING: A COMMUNITY-BASED COHORT IN NORTHEASTERN ILLINOIS, USA. PARTICIPANTS: ONE THOUSAND FOURTY-SIX OLDER ADULTS WHO WERE FREE OF DEMENTIA AT BASELINE AND UNDERWENT ANNUAL CLINICAL AND LITERACY ASSESSMENTS. MEASUREMENTS: FINANCIAL AND HEALTH LITERACY, DECISION MAKING, SCAM SUSCEPTIBILITY, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING WERE ASSESSED USING VALIDATED INSTRUMENTS. LINEAR MIXED EFFECTS MODELS ESTIMATED PERSON-SPECIFIC RATES OF CHANGE IN FINANCIAL AND HEALTH LITERACY, AND MULTIVARIABLE REGRESSION ANALYSES EXAMINED THE ASSOCIATIONS OF DECLINING LITERACY WITH SUBSEQUENT LEVELS OF DECISION MAKING, SCAM SUSCEPTIBILITY, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING. RESULTS: THE MEAN AGE WAS 81 YEARS AND 76% WERE FEMALE. OVER UP TO 10 YEARS OF ANNUAL FOLLOW-UPS, THE AVERAGE FINANCIAL AND HEALTH LITERACY SCORE DROPPED 1 PERCENTAGE POINT A YEAR. SUBSTANTIAL VARIABILITY IN DECLINE WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN PARTICIPANTS. FASTER DECLINE IN FINANCIAL AND HEALTH LITERACY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH POORER DECISION MAKING, HIGHER SCAM SUSCEPTIBILITY, AND LOWER PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING. NOTABLY, THESE ASSOCIATIONS WERE ABOVE AND BEYOND THE BASELINE LITERACY LEVEL AND PERSISTED EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR COGNITION. CONCLUSIONS: MOST COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS EXPERIENCE DECLINE IN FINANCIAL AND HEALTH LITERACY OVER TIME, BUT DECLINE IS NOT INEVITABLE. DECLINING LITERACY IS RELATED TO POORER DECISION MAKING, GREATER SCAM SUSCEPTIBILITY AND LOWER WELLBEING.

THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF PHYSICAL CONDITIONS AND HEALTH LITERACY AND TO EXAMINE THE DIFFERENCE IN HEALTH LITERACY LEVELS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS WITH MULTIMORBIDITY BASED ON PHYSICAL CONDITIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH ADDITIONAL MENTAL DISORDERS. METHODS: RESPONDENTS AGED 25 YEARS OR OLDER FROM A DANISH POPULATION-BASED SURVEY WERE INCLUDED (N = 28,627). MULTIMORBIDITY WAS ASSESSED BASED ON 18 SELF-REPORTED CHRONIC CONDITIONS; HEALTH LITERACY WAS MEASURED USING TWO SCALES FROM THE HEALTH LITERACY QUESTIONNAIRE FOCUSING ON UNDERSTANDING HEALTH INFORMATION AND ENGAGING WITH HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. ASSOCIATIONS WERE EXAMINED USING MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS. RESULTS: WE FOUND A POSITIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN NUMBER OF PHYSICAL CONDITIONS AND THE ODDS OF HAVING DIFFICULTIES IN UNDERSTANDING HEALTH INFORMATION AND ENGAGING WITH HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO (OR) OF HAVING DIFFICULTIES IN UNDERSTANDING HEALTH INFORMATION WAS 1.45 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI): 1.09-1.94) FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH TWO PHYSICAL CONDITIONS COMPARED WITH INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT MULTIMORBIDITY. THE ASSOCIATIONS FORMED A POSITIVE EXPOSURE-RESPONSE PATTERN. FURTHERMORE, RESPONDENTS WITH BOTH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL CONDITIONS HAD MORE THAN TWICE THE ODDS OF HAVING HEALTH LITERACY DIFFICULTIES COMPARED TO RESPONDENTS WITH ONLY PHYSICAL CONDITIONS (ADJUSTED OR 2.53 (95% CI 2.02-3.18) AND 2.28 (95% CI 1.92-2.72) FOR THE SCALES, RESPECTIVELY).

THE NEED TO MEASURE ORAL HEALTH LITERACY HAS LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENTS. THIS STUDY AIMED TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE INSTRUMENT FOR ADULTS AND TO EXAMINE ITS RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY IN CHINA. METHODS: A THREE-STEP DESIGN PROCESS WAS USED. FIRST, A LITERATURE REVIEW AND EXPERT PANEL DISCUSSION WERE USED TO DRAW UP A 37-ITEM POOL COVERING ORAL HEALTH KNOWLEDGE, BELIEF, PRACTICE, SKILL, AND FUNCTIONAL ORAL HEALTH LITERACY. THE DELPHI METHOD WAS USED TO DELETE AND MODIFY QUESTIONS IN THE ITEM POOL. THE DRAFT INSTRUMENT WAS EVALUATED BY NINE EXPERTS AND THE CONSENSUS AMONG THEM WAS CALCULATED USING THE CONTENT VALIDITY INDEX. THE SCALE WAS THEN USED TO CONDUCT A PSYCHOMETRIC STUDY AMONG 370 PARTICIPANTS FROM COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS IN BEIJING. CONSTRUCT VALIDITY, DISCRIMINANT VALIDITY AND CONCURRENT VALIDITY WERE EXAMINED. THE CRONBACH'S ALPHA COEFFICIENT, AND TEST-RETEST METHODS WERE USED TO ASSESS RELIABILITY. RESULTS: THE FINAL SCALE INCLUDED 30 ITEMS ACROSS FOUR DIMENSIONS. THE ITEM-LEVEL CONTENT VALIDITY INDEX WAS 0.90. EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS EXTRACTED FOUR FIXED FACTORS, AND THE RESULT OF THE KAISER-MEYER-OLKIN AND BARTLETT'S TESTS WAS 0.752, WITH THE MODEL EXPLAINING 35.21% OF THE TOTAL VARIANCE. THE FOUR DIMENSIONS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH ORAL HEALTH KNOWLEDGE, PERCEPTIONS OF ORAL HEALTH ISSUES, ORAL HEALTH PRACTICE AND SKILLS, AND FUNCTIONAL ORAL HEALTH LITERACY. THE MEAN SCORE OF THE LOWEST 27% WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE HIGHEST 27% (P<0.01), SUGGESTING ADEQUATE DISCRIMINANT VALIDITY. THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN COMPREHENSIVE ORAL HEALTH LITERACY SCORES AND EDUCATIONAL LEVEL, INCOME AND SELF-REPORTED LITERACY LEVEL WERE SIGNIFICANT (P<0.001), SHOWING ADEQUATE OVERALL CONCURRENT VALIDITY. INTERNAL CONSISTENCY AND TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY WERE ACCEPTABLE, WITH A CRONBACH'S ALPHA OF 0.72 AND A TOTAL TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY COEFFICIENT OF 0.979. CONCLUSIONS: INITIAL TESTING OF THE COMPREHENSIVE ORAL HEALTH LITERACY INSTRUMENT SUGGESTED THAT IT IS A VALID AND RELIABLE INSTRUMENT TO EVALUATE INDIVIDUALS' ORAL HEALTH LITERACY, WITH FOUR DIMENSIONS FOR EVALUATING KNOWLEDGE, BELIEF, SKILLS, AND FUNCTIONAL ORAL HEALTH LITERACY.","DEPARTMENT OF NURSING, PEKING UNIVERSITY FIRST HOSPITAL, BEIJING, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY NURSING, SCHOOL OF NURSING, PEKING UNIVERSITY, 38 XUEYUAN RD, HAIDIAN DISTRICT, BEIJING, CHINA.; SUNJING99@BJMU.;EDU.;CN.; THE SCHOOL OF BIOMEDICINE, BEIJING CITY UNIVERSITY, BEIJING, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF STOMATOLOGY, BEIJING ZHONGGUANCUN HOSPITAL, BEIJING, CHINA.; DEPARTMENT OF STOMATOLOGY, BEIJING ZHONGGUANCUN HOSPITAL, BEIJING, CHINA.;",NA," 2021.

HEALTH LITERACY PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS AND LOW HEALTH LITERACY HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH POORER OUTCOMES. THE AIMS OF THIS REVIEW ARE TO IDENTIFY WHICH OUTCOMES RELATE TO HEALTH LITERACY IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER, AND TO COMBINE THIS THROUGH A MIXED STUDIES APPROACH WITH THE PATIENT EXPERIENCE AS DESCRIBED THROUGH QUALITATIVE STUDIES. METHODS: FOUR ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED IN JANUARY 2021 TO IDENTIFY RECORDS RELATING TO HEALTH LITERACY AND PATIENTS WITH CANCER. RECORDS WERE INDEPENDENTLY SCREENED THEN ASSESSED FOR INCLUSION BY TWO REVIEWERS ACCORDING TO THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA: PATIENTS AGED 18 YEARS WITH CANCER, ENGLISH LANGUAGE PUBLICATION AND HEALTH LITERACY MEASURED WITH VALIDATED TOOL AND MEASURED OUTCOME ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTH LITERACY OR QUALITATIVE STUDY EXPLORING THE ROLE OF HEALTH LITERACY AS PATIENTS MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HEALTH. QUALITY WAS INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSED BY TWO REVIEWERS. A NARRATIVE SYNTHESIS WAS PERFORMED, AND FINDINGS INTEGRATED THROUGH CONCEPT MAPPING. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS REGISTERED WITH PROSPERO, ENTRY CRD42020166454. RESULTS: 4441 RECORDS WERE RETRIEVED. FOLLOWING DE-DUPLICATION, 2496 TITLES AND ABSTRACTS WERE SCREENED AND FULL TEXTS OF 405 PAPERS WERE REVIEWED FOR ELIGIBILITY. 66 PAPERS RELATING TO 60 STUDIES MET THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. LOWER HEALTH LITERACY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER DIFFICULTIES UNDERSTANDING AND PROCESSING CANCER RELATED INFORMATION, POORER QUALITY OF LIFE AND POORER EXPERIENCE OF CARE. PERSONAL AND SITUATIONAL INFLUENCES CONTRIBUTED TO HOW PARTICIPANTS PROCESSED INFORMATION AND REACHED DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR CARE. CONCLUSION: THIS REVIEW HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF HEALTH LITERACY FOR PATIENTS WITH CANCER. OUTCOMES ARE POORER FOR THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES WITH HEALTH LITERACY. FURTHER EFFORTS SHOULD BE MADE TO FACILITATE UNDERSTANDING, DEVELOP HEALTH LITERACY AND SUPPORT PATIENTS TO BECOME MORE INVOLVED IN THEIR CARE.","HEALTH SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON, SOUTHAMPTON, HAMPSHIRE, UNITED KINGDOM.; DORSET CANCER CENTRE, UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS DORSET NHS FOUNDATION TRUST, POOLE, DORSET, UNITED KINGDOM.; HEALTH SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON, SOUTHAMPTON, HAMPSHIRE, UNITED KINGDOM.; DORSET CANCER CENTRE, UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS DORSET NHS FOUNDATION TRUST, POOLE, DORSET, UNITED KINGDOM.; HEALTH SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON, SOUTHAMPTON, HAMPSHIRE, UNITED KINGDOM.;","ORCID: 0000-0002-4656-101X ORCID: 0000-0003-0657-2483",NA,"THE AUTHORS HAVE DECLARED THAT NO COMPETING INTERESTS EXIST.",NA,"2021/11/12 17:14","20211229","20211112",2021,"2021/11/13 06:00",NA,NA,"11","1932-6203 (ELECTRONIC) 1932-6203 (LINKING)","101285081","PLOS ONE","ENG","10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0259815 [DOI] E0259815","20211229","2021/12/30 06:00",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NLM","E0259815",NA,"PMC8589210",NA,"34767562","EPUBLISH",NA,"IM",NA,"PLOS ONE. 2021 NOV 12;16(11):E0259815.

METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON 410 RESPONDENTS FROM MAY 1 TO JULY 1, 2020, USING A FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY QUESTIONNAIRE CONSISTING OF 14 ITEMS THAT COVERS THREE CONCEPTUALLY DISTINCT FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY DOMAINS: HAVING SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO MANAGE MY HEALTH, ABILITY TO FIND GOOD HEALTH INFORMATION AND UNDERSTAND HEALTH INFORMATION WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT TO DO. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING THE STATISTICAL PACKAGE FOR SOCIAL SCIENCES (SPSS) VERSION 23. DATA WERE COLLECTED BY EXIT FACE-TO-FACE INTERVIEW USING AN INTERVIEWER ADMINISTERED AND PRE-TESTED QUESTIONNAIRE. STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF ASSOCIATED VARIABLES HAD BEEN DECLARED BASED ON THE ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO (AOR) WITH ITS 95% CI AND P-VALUE <0.05. RESULTS: ADEQUATE FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY WAS DETERMINED IN 55.4% OF CVD PATIENTS UNDERSTANDING HEALTH INFORMATION WHEREAS INADEQUATE FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY WAS DETERMINED IN 53.9% PARTICIPANTS FOR FINDING HEALTH INFORMATION AND IN 50.5% OF THEM HAVING SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO MANAGE MY HEALTH. EDUCATIONAL STATUS WAS FOUND TO HAVE A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION ACROSS THE THREE DOMAINS. CONCLUSION: THE FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY LEVEL OF CVD PATIENTS VARIED BY DOMAIN. EDUCATIONAL STATUS OF THE PARTICIPANT IS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE THREE DOMAINS OF FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY WHEREAS HOUSEHOLD MONTHLY INCOME AND NUMBER OF INFORMATION SOURCES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING SUFFICIENT INFORMATION AND THE ABILITY TO FIND GOOD HEALTH INFORMATION. THE FINDINGS INDICATE THE NEED TO STREAMLINE MEDICAL COMMUNICATION THAT IMPROVES THE FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY OF CVD PATIENTS.","NURSING SCHOOL, FACULTY OF HEALTH SCIENCE, INSTITUTE OF HEALTH, JIMMA UNIVERSITY, ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA.; HEALTH INFORMATION, JIMMA MEDICAL CENTER, ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA.; NURSING SCHOOL, FACULTY OF HEALTH SCIENCE, INSTITUTE OF HEALTH, JIMMA UNIVERSITY, ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA.; MIDWIFERY SCHOOL, FACULTY OF HEALTH SCIENCE, INSTITUTE OF HEALTH, JIMMA UNIVERSITY, ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA.;","ORCID: 0000-0003-3636-6402 ORCID: 0000-0001-8283-9667"," 2021 TILAHUN ET AL.","THE AUTHORS REPORTED NO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST FOR THIS WORK.",NA,"2021/05/27 06:37",NA,"20210519",2021,"2021/05/28 06:00",NA,NA,NA,"1178-7074 (PRINT) 1178-7074 (ELECTRONIC) 1178-7074 (LINKING)","101515487","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL MEDICINE","ENG","10.2147/IJGM.S304007 [DOI]","20210528","2021/05/28 06:01",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","NLM","1967-1974",NA,"PMC8141385",NA,"34040428","EPUBLISH",NA,NA,NA,"INT J GEN MED. 2021 MAY 19;14:1967-1974.
