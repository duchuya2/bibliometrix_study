AB Many trauma survivors seem to be reluctant to seek professional help. The aim of the current review was to synthesize relevant literature, and to systematically classify trauma survivors' perceived barriers and facilitators regarding mental health service utilization. The systematic search identified 19 studies addressing military personnel and 17 studies with trauma survivors of the general population. The data analysis revealed that the most prominent barriers included concerns related to stigma, shame and rejection, low mental health literacy, lack of knowledge and treatment-related doubts, fear of negative social consequences, limited resources, time, and expenses. Perceived facilitators lack attention in research, but can be influential in understanding mental health service use. Another prominent finding was that trauma survivors face specific trauma-related barriers to mental health service use, especially concerns about re-experiencing the traumatic events. Many trauma survivors avoid traumatic reminders and are therefore concerned about dealing with certain memories in treatment These perceived barriers and facilitators were discussed regarding future research and practical implications in order to facilitate mental health service use among trauma survivors.

TI Gaps in understanding health and engagement with healthcare providers
   across common long-term conditions: a population survey of health
   literacy in 29 473 Danish citizens
SO BMJ OPEN

AB Objectives: To (1) quantify levels of subjective health literacy in people with long-term health conditions (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, musculoskeletal disorders, cancer and mental disorders) and compare these to levels in the general population and (2) examine the association between health literacy, socioeconomic characteristics and comorbidity in each long-term condition group.
   Design: Population-based survey in the Central Denmark Region (n=29 473).
   Main outcome measures: Health literacy was measured using two scales from the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ): (1) Ability to understand health information and (2) Ability to actively engage with healthcare providers.
   Results: People with long-term conditions reported more difficulties than the general population in understanding health information and actively engaging with healthcare providers. Wide variation was found between disease groups, with people with cancer having fewer difficulties and people with mental health disorders having more difficulties in actively engaging with healthcare providers than other long-term condition groups. Having more than one long-term condition was associated with more difficulty in engaging with healthcare providers and understanding health information. People with low levels of education had lower health literacy than people with high levels of education.
   Conclusions: Compared with the general population, people with long-term conditions report more difficulties in understanding health information and engaging with healthcare providers. These two dimensions are critical to the provision of patient-centred healthcare and for optimising health outcomes. More effort should be made to respond to the health literacy needs among individuals with long-term conditions, multiple comorbidities and low education levels, to improve health outcomes and to reduce social inequality in health.

AB Study objective: We assess emergency department (ED) patients' health literacy, the readability of ED patient materials, and the relationship between health literacy and ED outcomes through a systematic literature review.
   Methods: PubMed, PsychInfo, CINAHL, Web of Knowledge, and ERIC were searched for studies published January 1, 1980, to July 15, 2010, conducted in the United States, reporting original data, and measuring ED patients' health literacy, the readability of ED materials, or the association between health literacy and ED-related outcomes. Two reviewers evaluated each study and abstracted information from included studies into evidence tables.
   Results: We identified 413 articles, and 31 met inclusion criteria. Collectively, health literacy skills were assessed at or below the eighth-grade level for approximately 40% of ED patients. In contrast, ED patient materials were typically assessed at or above the ninth-grade level. Studies of adults aged 65 years and older found that those with lower health literacy were more likely to use the ED and incur higher ED costs. Studies of pediatric ED patients did not find direct effects of caregiver literacy on ED outcomes.
   Conclusion: A substantial proportion of ED patients have limited health literacy, and ED materials are typically too complex for these patients. It is important for EDs to evaluate the accessibility and patient understanding of information presented. The evidence linking health literacy to ED outcomes is limited. Additional research is needed to better understand the relationship between health literacy and ED outcomes. [Ann Emerg Med. 2011; 57:334-345.]

AB Objective: To examine patients' use of medication management strategies (e.g., reminders, pill boxes), and to determine how their use influences the relationship between patient characteristics and medication adherence.
   Methods: Retrospective and cross-sectional study of 434 patients with coronary heart disease, examining both refill adherence and self-reported adherence.
   Results: The most common strategy for managing refills was seeing a near empty pill bottle (89.9%), and for managing daily medications, it was associating medications with daily events (80.4%). Age <65 (OR = 1.7), as well as marginal (OR = 2.0) or inadequate health literacy (OR = 1.9), was independently associated with low refill adherence. Patients <65 also had lower self-reported adherence (OR = 1.8). Adjustment for use of medication management strategies did not substantially change these relationships. Reliance on reminders from friends or family to take medications, or waiting to refill a medicine only when the bottle was near empty, each were associated with 3-fold greater odds of non-adherence.
   Conclusion: Age <65 and marginal or inadequate health literacy were independently associated with medication non-adherence. Use of medication management strategies did not explain these relationships.
   Practice implications: The strategies which patients report using to assist with managing medication refills and daily medication use may be ineffective. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: This study (a) evaluated the reading ability of patients following stroke and their carers and the reading level and content and design characteristics of the written information provided to them, (b) explored the influence of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics on patients' reading ability, and (c) described an education package that provides well-designed information tailored to patients' and carers' informational needs.
   Methods: Fifty-seven patients and 12 carers were interviewed about their informational needs in an acute stroke unit. Their reading ability was assessed using the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM). The written information provided to them in the acute stroke unit was analysed using the SMOG readability formula and the Suitability Assessment of Materials (SAM).
   Results: Thirteen (22.8%) patients and 5 (41.7%) carers had received written stroke information. The mean reading level of materials analysed was 11th grade while patients read at a mean of 7-8th grade. Most materials (89%) scored as only adequate in content and design. Patients with combined aphasia read significantly lower (4-6th grade) than other patients (p = 0.001).
   Conclusion: Only a small proportion of patients and carers received written materials about stroke and the readability level and content and design characteristics of most materials required improvement.
   Practice implications: When developing and distributing written materials about stroke, health professionals should consider the reading ability and informational needs of the recipients, and the reading level and content and design characteristics of the written materials. A computer system can be used to generate written materials tailored to the informational needs and literacy skills of patients and carers. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To validate a hypothesized model exploring the influencing pathways of empowerment perceptions, health literacy, self-efficacy, and self-care behaviors to glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).
   Methods: Overall, 295 patients with T2DM were recruited from five endocrine clinics in Taiwan through convenience sampling. Data regarding personal characteristics, empowerment perceptions, health literacy, self-efficacy, self-care behaviors, and HbA1c levels were collected. A structural equation modeling was used to validate the hypothesized model.
   Results: Significant direct pathways were determined from empowerment perceptions to health literacy, from health literacy to self-efficacy, from self-efficacy to self-care behaviors, and from self-care behaviors to HbA1c levels.
   Conclusions: The empowerment perceptions and health literacy relatively influenced self-efficacy and self-care behaviors. Self-efficacy and self-care behaviors relatively influenced glycemic control in patients with T2DM. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID INTERNET USE; SEEKING BEHAVIORS; CARE INFORMATION; LITERACY; ILLNESS;

AB Background: Although the increasing dissemination and use of health-related information on the Internet has the potential to empower citizens and patients, several studies have detected disparities in the use of online health information. This is due to several factors. So far, only a few studies have examined the impact of socio-economic status (SES) on health information seeking on the Internet. This study was designed to identify sociodemographic and health-(care-) related differences between users and non-users of health information gleaned from the Internet with the aim of detecting hard-to-reach target groups.
   Methods: This study analyzed data from the NRW Health Survey LZG. NRW 2011 (n = 2,000; conducted in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, via telephone interviews). Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the determinants of online health information seeking behavior.
   Results: 68% of Internet users refer to the Internet for health-related purposes. Of the independent variables tested, SES proved to exert the strongest influence on searching the Internet for health information. The final multivariate regression model shows that people from the middle (OR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.6-3.2) and upper (OR: 4.0, 95% CI: 2.7-6.2) social classes are more likely to seek health information on the Internet than those from the lower class. Also, women are more likely to look for health information on the Internet than men (OR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1-2.1). Individuals with a migration background are less likely to conduct health searches on the Internet (OR: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.4-0.8). Married people or individuals in a stable relationship search the Internet more often for health information than do singles (OR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.2-2.9). Also, heavy use of health-care services compared to non-use is associated with a higher likelihood of using the Internet for health-related matters (OR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.2-2.5).
   Conclusions: In order to achieve equity in health, health-related Internet use by the socially deprived should be promoted through measures to increase their level of e-health literacy. Furthermore, longitudinal studies are needed in order to gain reliable data/results on determinants of health-related Internet use.

AB Objective: To evaluate an entertainment-based patient decision aid for early stage breast cancer surgery in low health literacy patients.
   Methods: Newly diagnosed female patients with early stage breast cancer from two public hospitals were randomized to receive an entertainment-based decision aid for breast cancer treatment along with usual care (intervention arm) or to receive usual care only (control arm). Pre-decision (baseline), pre-surgery, and 1-year follow-up assessments were conducted.
   Results: Patients assigned to the intervention arm of the study were more likely than the controls to choose mastectomy rather than breast-conserving surgery; however, they appeared better informed and clearer about their surgical options than women assigned to the control group. No differences in satisfaction with the surgical decision or the decision-making process were observed between the patients who viewed the intervention and those assigned to the control group.
   Conclusions: Entertainment education may be a desirable strategy for informing lower health literate women about breast cancer surgery options.
   Practice Implications: Incorporating patient decision aids, particularly computer-based decision aids, into standard clinical practice remains a challenge; however, patients may be directed to view programs at home or at public locations (e.g., libraries, community centers).

TI Effectiveness of a Web-Based Colorectal Cancer Screening Patient
   Decision Aid A Randomized Controlled Trial in a Mixed-Literacy

LA English
DT Article

AB Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening reduces mortality yet remains underutilized. Low health literacy may contribute to this underutilization by interfering with patients' ability to understand and receive preventive health services.
   Purpose: To determine if a web-based multimedia CRC screening patient decision aid, developed for a mixed-literacy audience, could increase CRC screening.
   Design: RCT. Patients aged 50-74 years and overdue for CRC screening were randomized to the web-based decision aid or a control program seen immediately before a scheduled primary care appointment.
   Setting/participants: A large community-based, university-affiliated internal medicine practice serving a socioeconomically disadvantaged population.
   Main outcome measures: Patients completed surveys to determine their ability to state a screening test preference and their readiness to receive screening. Charts were abstracted by masked observers to determine if screening tests were ordered and completed.
   Results: Between November 2007 and September 2008, a total of 264 patients enrolled in the study. Data collection was completed in 2009, and data analysis was completed in 2010. A majority of participants (mean age=57.8 years) were female (67%), African-American (74%), had annual household incomes of <$20,000 (76%), and had limited health literacy (56%). When compared to control participants, more decision-aid participants had a CRC screening preference (84% vs 55%, p<0.0001) and an increase in readiness to receive screening (52% vs 20%, p=0.0001). More decision-aid participants had CRC screening tests ordered (30% vs 21%) and completed (19% vs 14%), but no statistically significant differences were seen (AOR=1.6, 95% C=0.97, 2.8, and AOR=1.7, 95% CI=0.88, 3.2, respectively). Similar results were found across literacy levels.
   Conclusions: The web-based decision aid increased patients' ability to form a test preference and their intent to receive screening, regardless of literacy level. Further study should examine ways the decision aid can be combined with additional system changes to increase CRC screening.

AB Studies have demonstrated significant associations between limited literacy and health outcomes. Yet differences in literacy measurement and the cutoffs used for analysis have made it difficult to fully understand the relationship between literacy and health across the entire spectrum of literacy (i.e., whether the relationship is continuous and graded or whether a threshold exists below which literacy is independently associated with health). To analyze this question, we re-examined the relationship between literacy, baseline physical functioning and mental health, and all-cause mortality for a cohort of 3260 US community-dwelling elderly who were interviewed in 1997 to determine demographics, socioeconomic status, chronic conditions, self-reported physical and mental health (SF-36 subscales), health behaviors, and literacy based upon the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA). All-cause mortality was determined using data from the US National Death Index through 2003. Seven categories of S-TOFHLA literacy scores were created and used in this analysis instead of the existing three categories identified with the measure. In multivariate analyses, a continuous, graded relationship between literacy and baseline physical functioning was identified. However, participants scoring below the third literacy category had significantly worse mental health compared to the highest literacy category, displaying a notable threshold. Finally, all six literacy categories were significantly associated with greater all-cause mortality risk compared to the highest literacy category, but again there was a marked threshold below the third category at which the adjusted mortality rate significantly increased compared to all other categories. We conclude that the nature of the relationship between literacy and health may vary depending upon the outcome under examination. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objectives:
   To develop and validate an instrument to measure the functional oral health literacy of adults.
   Methods:
   For the generation of items different dental patient educational materials and text types were selected that had reading levels similar to materials used for the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA) which was the model for our Oral Health Literacy Instrument (OHLI). The OHLI contains reading comprehension and numeracy sections. The reading comprehension section is a 38-item test with words omitted from one passage on dental caries and another on periodontal disease. The numeracy section has 19 items to test comprehension of directions for taking common prescriptions associated with dental treatment, postextraction instructions and dental appointments. We also developed a 17-item oral health knowledge test. The OHLI, the TOFHLA, the oral health knowledge test and a brief questionnaire were administered to a convenience sample of 100 patients. Internal reliability of OHLI was assessed with Cronbach's alpha. Test-retest reliability was examined by intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Concurrent validity was tested by comparing OHLI scores across categories of education level and frequency of dental visits. Construct validity was assessed by correlating OHLI scores with TOFHLA scores and with the oral health knowledge scores using Spearman's rho (rho) and multiple linear regression.
   Results:
   Participants averaged 39 years (SD = 12.4); 73% were female; 64% had college/university education; 40% visited a dentist every 3-6 months. Total OHLI and TOFHLA weighted mean scores were 87.2 and 91.7, respectively (possible range 0-100). The Cronbach's alpha values were high (> 0.7) for OHLI and its components. The ICC values indicated good agreement between the test and retest results for OHLI and the oral health knowledge test. Patients visiting a dentist every 3-6 months had significantly higher levels of oral health literacy than those visiting only when they felt pain. The association between OHLI and education level was not significant. OHLI scores were significantly correlated with the scores on the TOFHLA (rho = 0.613) and the test of oral health knowledge (rho = 0.573). These associations remained significant in multiple regression models.
   Conclusion:
   Initial testing of OHLI suggested that it is a valid and reliable instrument to evaluate oral health literacy among adults, although additional work is needed to investigate the instrument's predictive validity and sensitivity to change using oral health outcomes with population groups known to be at high risk of low functional oral health literacy.

AB Objective: We sought to identify characteristics associated with favorable treatment in receipt of preventive healthcare services, from the perspective of resettled African refugee women.
   Methods: Individual, in-depth interviews with 34 Somali women in Rochester, NY, USA. Questions explored positive and negative experiences with primary health care services, beliefs about respectful versus disrespectful treatment, experiences of racism, prejudice or bias, and ideas about removing access barriers and improving health care services. Analysis was guided by grounded theory.
   Results: Qualities associated with a favorable healthcare experience included effective verbal and nonverbal communication, feeling valued and understood, availability of female interpreters and clinicians and sensitivity to privacy for gynecologic concerns. Participants stated that adequate transportation, access to healthcare services and investment in community-based programs to improve health literacy about women's preventive health services were prerequisite to any respectful health care system.
   Conclusion: Effective communication, access to healthcare services with female interpreters and clinicians, and community programs to promote health literacy are themes associated with respectful and effective healthcare experiences among Somali women.
   Practice implications: Adequate interpreter services are essential. Patient-provider gender concordance is important to many Somali women, especially for gynecological concerns. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: This study aims to evaluate a dental health literacy word recognition instrument. Methods: Based on a reading recognition test used in medicine, the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM), we developed the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Dentistry (REALD-99). Parents of pediatric dental patients were recruited from local dental clinics and asked to read aloud words in both REALM and REALD-99. REALD-99 scores had a possible range of 0 (low literacy) to 99 (high literacy); REALM scores ranged from 0 to 66. Outcome measures included parents' perceived oral health for themselves and of their children, and oral health-related quality of life of the parent as measured by the short-form Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14). To determine the validity, we tested bivariate correlations between REALM and REALD-99, REALM and perceived dental outcomes, and REALD-99 and perceived dental outcomes. We used ordinary least squares regression and logit models to further examine the relationship between REALD-99 and dental outcomes. We determined internal reliability using Cronbach's alpha. Results: One hundred two parents of children were interviewed. The average REALD-99 and REALM-66 scores were high (84 and 62, respectively). REALD-99 was positively correlated with REALM (PCC = 0.80). REALM was not related to dental outcomes. REALD-99 was associated with parents' OHIP-14 score in multivariate analysis. REALD-99 had good reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.86). Conclusions: REALD-99 has promise for measuring dental health literacy because it demonstrated good reliability and is quick and easy to administer. Additional studies are needed to examine the validity of REALD-99 using objective clinical oral health measures and more proximal outcomes such as behavior and compliance to specific health instructions.

AB Background: Low health literacy affects millions of Americans, putting those who are affected at a disadvantage and at risk for poorer health outcomes. Low health literacy can act as a barrier to effective disease self-management; this is especially true for chronic diseases such as heart failure (HF) that require complicated self-care regimens. Purpose: This systematic review examined quantitative research literature published between 1999 and 2014 to explore the role of health literacy among HF patients. The specific aims of the systematic review are to (1) describe the prevalence of low health literacy among HF patients, (2) explore the predictors of low health literacy among HF patients, and (3) discuss the relationship between health literacy and HF self-care and common HF outcomes. Methods: A systematic search of the following databases was conducted, PubMed, CINAHL Plus, Embase, PsycINFO, and Scopus, using relevant keywords and clear inclusion and exclusion criteria. Conclusions: An average of 39% of HF patients have low health literacy. Age, race/ethnicity, years of education, and cognitive function are predictors of health literacy. In addition, adequate health literacy is consistently correlated with higher HF knowledge and higher salt knowledge. Clinical Implications: Considering the prevalence of low health literacy among in the HF population, nurses and healthcare professionals need to recognize the consequences of low health literacy and adopt strategies that could minimize its detrimental effect on the patient's health outcomes.

AB Objective
   We sought to provide normative data for the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) for adolescent boys.
   Method
   The EDE-Q was completed by 531 boys aged 12-18 years recruited from a number of schools in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) region of Australia. Data for 1,135 female adolescents, recruited as part of the same research project, are provided for comparative purposes.
   Results
   Scores on each the EDE-Q subscales and, with the exception of excessive exercise, the prevalence of each of the eating disorder behaviors assessed, were substantially higher among girls than among boys. Still, 6.0% of boys reported regular episodes of objective binge eating, 8.3% reported regular episodes of loss of control eating, 5.3% reported regular excessive exercise and 4.9% reported overvaluation of weight or shape. Eating-disordered behavior was more common among older adolescents than among younger adolescents and this was the case for both boys and girls. Reliability coefficients for the EDE-Q subscales were marginally lower in boys (0.70-0.94) than in girls (0.84-0.97).
   Conclusions
   The EDE-Q appears to be suitable for use in adolescent boys, with the qualification that eating and weight/shape control behaviors that are largely confined to males may not be adequately assessed. The lack of assessment of subjective binge eating episodes may also be problematic. There is a need for research addressing whether and to what extent different features are associated with distress and disability in boys as well as the validity of the EDE-Q assessment of these features when compared with interview assessment.

AB Background: Low health literacy is associated with poor outcomes in asthma and other diseases, but the mechanisms governing this relationship are not well defined.
   Objective: We sought to assess whether literacy is related to subsequent asthma self-management, measured as adherence to inhaled steroids, and asthma outcomes.
   Methods: In a prospective longitudinal cohort study, numeric (Asthma Numeracy Questionnaire) and print literacy (Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults) were assessed at baseline in adults with moderate or severe asthma for their impact on subsequent electronically monitored adherence and asthma outcomes (asthma control, asthma-related quality of life, and FEV1) over 26 weeks, using mixed-effects linear regression models.
   Results: A total of 284 adults participated: age, 48 6 14 years, 71% females, 70% African American, 6% Latino, mean FEV1 66% +/- 19%, 86 (30%) with hospitalizations, and 148 (52%) with emergency department visits for asthma in the prior year. Mean Asthma Numeracy Questionnaire score was 2.3 +/- 1.2 (range, 04); mean Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults score was 31 6 8 (range, 0-36). In unadjusted analyses, numeric and print literacy were associated with better adherence (P = .01 and P = .08, respectively), asthma control (P = .005 and P < .001, respectively), and quality of life (P < .001 and P < .001, respectively). After controlling for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, the associations diminished and only quality of life (numeric P = .03, print P = .006) and asthma control (print P = .005) remained significantly associated with literacy. Race/ethnicity, income, and educational attainment were correlated (P < .001).
   Conclusion: While the relationship between literacy and health is complex, interventions that account for and address the literacy needs of patients may improve asthma outcomes.

AB Aim: With approximately 50% of young people aged 1824 in tertiary education, these are potential settings for programmes to improve mental health literacy. A survey was carried out with students and staff of a tertiary education institution to investigate recognition of depression, help-seeking intentions, beliefs about interventions and stigmatizing attitudes.
   Methods: Students of an Australian metropolitan university (with staff as a comparison group) participated in a telephone interview. They answered questions relating to mental health literacy.
   Results: Of the completed interviews, 774 (65%) were students and 422 (35%) were staff. Over 70% of students and staff were able to recognize depression in a vignette, with greater likelihood of recognition in students associated with older age, female gender, being born in Australia and a higher level of education. Over 80% of respondents said they would seek help if they had a problem similar to that of the vignette. However, rates of specific help-seeking intentions for students were relatively low, with only 26% nominating a general practitioner and only 10% nominating a student counsellor. Factors associated with stigmatizing attitudes included male gender, younger age, lower level of education, being born outside Australia and lack of recognition of depression.
   Conclusions: There is a need for mental health literacy interventions targeted at students, particularly those who are younger, male, born outside Australia and of a lower level of education. As rates of specific help-seeking intentions for students were relatively low, there is a need for further exploration of the barriers to help seeking from professional sources.

AB Background: Although limited health literacy is a barrier to disease management and has been associated with poor glycemic control, the mechanisms underlying the relationships between health literacy and diabetes outcomes are unknown. We examined the relationships between health literacy, determinants of diabetes self-care, and glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes.
   Methods: Patients with diabetes were recruited from an outpatient primary care clinic. We collected information on demographics, health literacy, diabetes knowledge, diabetes fatalism, social support, and diabetes self-care, and hemoglobin A1c values were extracted from the medical record. Structural equation models tested the predicted pathways linking health literacy to diabetes self-care and glycemic control.
   Results: No direct relationship was observed between health literacy and diabetes self-care or glycemic control. Health literacy had a direct effect on social support (r = -0.20, P < 0.05) and through social support had an indirect effect on diabetes self-care (r = -0.07) and on glycemic control (r = -0.01). More diabetes knowledge (r = 0.22, P < 0.05), less fatalism (r = -0.22, P < 0.05), and more social support (r = 0.27, P < 0.01) were independent, direct predictors of diabetes self-care and through self-care were related to glycemic control (r = -0.20, P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest health literacy has an indirect effect on diabetes self-care and glycemic control through its association with social support. This suggests that for patients with limited health literacy, enhancing social support would facilitate diabetes self-care and improved glycemic control.

AB People with mental disorders experience discrimination as a consequence of stigmatising attitudes that are largely socio-culturally constructed. Thus, there is a need to understand local contexts in order to develop effective programs to change such attitudes. We undertook a mental health literacy survey in rural Maharashtra, India, prior to developing a mental health training program for village health workers (VHWs) in a primary health care setting.
   A cross-sectional mental health literacy survey was undertaken in late 2007, which involved interviewer-administration of a questionnaire to 240 systematically sampled community members, and 60 purposively sampled VHWs. Participants were presented with two vignettes describing people experiencing symptoms of mental disorders (depression, psychosis), and were asked about attitudes towards, and desired social distance from, the people in the vignettes (the latter being a proxy measure for stigma). Linear regression modelling was undertaken to identify predictors of social distance.
   Although the community was relatively accepting of people with mental disorders, false beliefs and negative attitudes were still evident. Desired social distance was consistently greater for the person depicted in the psychosis vignette compared to the depression vignette. For both vignettes, the main predictor of greater social distance was perceiving the person as dangerous, and the predictors of reduced social distance were being a VHW, and seeing the problem as a sign of personal weakness. For depression, believing the cause to be family tensions also reduced social distance. For psychosis, labelling the disorder as a mind/brain problem, and believing the cause to be lack of control over life or genetic factors increased social distance. The vast majority did not agree that the problems experienced in the vignettes were 'a real medical illness'.
   Promoting bio-medical explanations for mental disorders in this setting may exacerbate discriminatory attitudes. Provision of contextually relevant mental health training for the VHWs so that they are able to communicate, model and shape more positive attitudes is the next step.

AB Objective: To determine whether health literacy is lower in rural populations. Method. We analyzed health, prose, document, and quantitative literacy from the National Assessment of Adult Literacy study. Metropolitan Statistical Area designated participants as rural or urban. Results: Rural populations had lower literacy levels for all literacy types (P<0.001 for each). After adjusting for known confounders, there was no longer a difference in health or prose literacy (P>0.05). However, rural populations had higher document (P=0.04) and quantitative (P=0.01) literacy. Conclusion: Health literacy is lower in the rural population although this difference is explained by known confounders.

AB OBJECTIVE. Concerns about the safety and efficacy of over-the-counter cold medications have led to a recent US Food and Drug Administration public health advisory against their use in children < 2 years of age. Our goal was to examine caregiver understanding of the age indication of over-the-counter cold medication labels and identify factors, associated with caregiver understanding.
   METHODS. Caregivers of infant children (<= 1 year old) were recruited from clinics at 3 institutions. Questions were administered regarding the use of 4 previously common "infant" over-the-counter cold and cough medicines labeled to consult a physician if used in children < 2 years of age. Literacy and numeracy skills were assessed with validated instruments.
   RESULTS. A total of 182 caregivers were recruited; 87% were the infants' mothers. Mean education level was 12.5 years, and 99% had adequate literacy skills, but only 17% had > 9th-grade numeracy skills. When examining the front of the product label, 86% of the time parents thought these products were appropriate for use in children < 2 years of age. More than 50% of the time, parents stated they would give these over-the-counter products to a 13-month-old child with cold symptoms. Common factors that influenced parental decisions included label saying "infant," graphics (eg, infants, teddy bears, droppers), and dosing directions. Caregivers were influenced by the dosing directions only 47% of the time. Caregivers with lower numeracy skills were more likely to provide inappropriate reasons for giving an over-the-counter medication.
   CONCLUSIONS. Misunderstanding of over-the-counter cold products is common and could result in harm if medications are given inappropriately. Label language and graphics seem to influence inappropriate interpretation of over-the-counter product age indications. Poorer parental numeracy skills may increase the misinterpretation of these products. Opportunities exist for the Food and Drug Administration and manufacturers to revise existing labels to improve parental comprehension and enhance child safety. Pediatrics 2009; 123: 1464-1471

AB BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer screening rates remain low, especially among low-income and racial/ethnic minority groups.
   OBJECTIVE: We pilot-tested a physician-directed strategy aimed at improving rates of recommendation and patient colorectal cancer screening completion at 1 federally qualified health center serving low-income, African-American and Hispanic patients. Colonoscopy was specifically targeted.
   DESIGN: Single arm, pretest-posttest design.
   SETTINGS: Urban.
   PATIENTS: 154 screening-eligible, yet nonadherent primary care patients receiving care at an urban, federally qualified health center.
   INTERVENTION: 1) manually tracking screening-eligible patients, 2) mailing patients a physician letter and brochure before medical visits, 3) health literacy training to help physicians improve their communication with patients to work to resolution, and 4) establishing a "feedback loop" to routinely monitor patient compliance.
   MEASUREMENT: Chart review of whether patients received a physician recommendation for screening, and completion of any colorectal cancer screening test 12 months after intervention. Physicians recorded patients' qualitative reasons for noncompliance, and a preliminary cost-effectiveness analysis for screening promotion was also conducted.
   RESULTS: The baseline screening rate was 11.5%, with 31.6% of patients having received a recommendation from their physician. At 1-year follow-up, rates of screening completion had increased to 27.9 percent (p <.001), and physician recommendation had increased to 92.9% (p <.001). Common reasons for nonadherence included patient readiness (60.7%), competing health problems (11.9%), and fear or anxiety concerning the procedure (8.3%). The total cost for implementing the intervention was $4,676 and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the intervention was $106 per additional patient screened by colonoscopy.
   CONCLUSIONS: The intervention appears to be a feasible means to improve colorectal cancer screening rates among patients served by community health centers. However, more attention to patient decision making and education may be needed to further increase screening rates.

AB PURPOSE Despite some recent improvement in knowledge about cholesterol in the United States, patient adherence to cholesterol treatment recommendations remains suboptimal. We undertook a qualitative study that explored patients perceptions of cholesterol and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and their reactions to 3 strategies for communicating CVD risk.
   METHODS We conducted 7 focus groups in New England using open-ended questions and visual risk communication prompts. The multidisciplinary study team performed qualitative content analysis through immersion/crystallization processes and analyzing coded reports using NVivo qualitative coding software.
   RESULTS All participants were aware that "high cholesterol" levels adversely affect health. Many had, however, inadequate knowledge about hypercholesterolemia and CVD risk, and few knew their cholesterol numbers. Many assumed they had been tested and their cholesterol concentrations were healthy, even if their physicians had not mentioned it. Standard visual representations showing statistical probabilities of risk were assessed as confusing and uninspiring. A strategy that provides a cardiovascular risk-adjusted age was evaluated as clear, memorable, relevant, and potentially capable of motivating people to make healthful changes. A few participants in each focus group were concerned that a cardiovascular risk-adjusted age that was greater than chronological age would frighten patients.
   CONCLUSIONS Complex explanations about cholesterol and CVD risk appear to be insufficient for motivating behavior change. A cardiovascular risk-adjusted age calculator is one strategy that may engage patients in recognizing their CVD risk and, when accompanied by information about risk reduction, may be helpful in communicating risk to patients.

AB We sought to develop a reliable and valid measure of patient self-efficacy within the context of productive communication and positive attitude for cancer patients. A set of 19 potential items for the Communication and Attitudinal Self-Efficacy scale for cancer (CASE-cancer) was pilot tested with 50 cancer patients. Based on the pilot test, item valence was made consistent (i.e., all items worded positively) and the response scale was simplified. The CASE-cancer was then administered to 127 persons receiving cancer treatment at general oncology clinics in Shreveport. Louisiana and Chicago, Illinois. Psychometric analyses revealed three 4-item factors: understanding and participating in care, maintaining a positive attitude, and seeking and obtaining information. The CASE-cancer proved to have high internal consistency and construct validity. Moreover, scale items performed similarly across literacy levels. The CASE-cancer is a psychometrically-sound tool that may provide new information on important mediating factors of cancer care. Our two-step approach to presenting response options may also provide a model for helping lower literate patients more accurately respond to survey items. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Background: We sought to determine the prevalence of low health literacy (LHL) among patients in a preoperative clinic, the characteristics associated with LHL, and the association between LHL and adherence to preoperative instructions.
   Methods: We conducted a cohort study and interviewed patients at a VA preoperative clinic. We administered a health literacy test and collected sociodemographic information. When patients returned for their scheduled surgical procedures, adherence to preoperative instructions was, assessed.
   Results: Of 332 participants, 12% (n = 40) had LHL. Low health literacy was more prevalent among older adults (more than 65 years) compared with those under age 65. Patients with LHL were more likely to be nonadherent to preoperative medication instructions (odds ratio = 1.9; 95% confidence interval: 0.8 to 4.8), but this was of borderline statistical significance.
   Conclusions: Low health literacy was common among older patients and appeared to be associated with lower adherence to preoperative medication instructions. Published by Excerpta Medica, Inc.

AB Health literacy is an important construct in population health and healthcare requiring rigorous measurement. The Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ), with nine scales, measures a broad perception of health literacy. This study aimed to adapt the HLQ to the Danish setting, and to examine the factor structure, homogeneity, reliability and discriminant validity. The HLQ was adapted using forward-backward translation, consensus conference and cognitive interviews (n = 15). Psychometric properties were examined based on data collected by face-to-face interview (n = 481). Tests included difficulty level, composite scale reliability and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Cognitive testing revealed that only minor re-wording was required. The easiest scale to respond to positively was 'Social support for health', and the hardest were 'Navigating the healthcare system' and 'Appraisal of health information'. CFA of the individual scales showed acceptably high loadings (range 0.49-0.93). CFA fit statistics after including correlated residuals were good for seven scales, acceptable for one. Composite reliability and Cronbach's a were >0.8 for all but one scale. A nine-factor CFA model was fitted to items with no cross-loadings or correlated residuals allowed. Given this restricted model, the fit was satisfactory. The HLQ appears robust for its intended application of assessing health literacy in a range of settings. Further work is required to demonstrate sensitivity to measure changes.

AB Background: In the rapidly developing use of the Internet in society, eHealth literacy-having the skills to utilize health information on the Internet-has become an important prerequisite for promoting healthy behavior. However, little is known about whether eHealth literacy is associated with health behavior in a representative sample of adult Internet users.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the association between eHealth literacy and general health behavior (cigarette smoking, physical exercise, alcohol consumption, sleeping hours, eating breakfast, eating between meals, and balanced nutrition) among adult Internet users in Japan.
   Methods: The participants were recruited among registrants of a Japanese Internet research service company and asked to answer a cross-sectional Internet-based survey in 2012. The potential respondents (N= 10,178) were randomly and blindly invited via email from the registrants in accordance with the set sample size and other attributes. eHealth literacy was assessed using the Japanese version of the eHealth Literacy Scale. The self-reported health behaviors investigated included never smoking cigarettes, physical exercise, alcohol consumption, sleeping hours, eating breakfast, not eating between meals, and balanced nutrition. We obtained details of sociodemographic attributes (sex, age, marital status, educational attainment, and household income level) and frequency of conducting Internet searches. To determine the association of each health behavior with eHealth literacy, we performed a logistic regression analysis; we adjusted for sociodemographic attributes and frequency of Internet searching as well as for other health behaviors that were statistically significant with respect to eHealth literacy in univariate analyses.
   Results: We analyzed the data of 2115 adults (response rate: 24.04%, 2142/10,178; male: 49.74%, 1052/2115; age: mean 39.7, SD 10.9 years) who responded to the survey. Logistic regression analysis showed that individuals with high eHealth literacy were significantly more likely to exhibit the good health behaviors of physical exercise (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.377, 95% CI 1.131-1.678) and eating a balanced diet (AOR 1.572, 95% CI 1.274-1.940) than individuals with low eHealth literacy.
   Conclusions: We found that some health behaviors, including exercise and balanced nutrition, were independently associated with eHealth literacy among Japanese adult Internet users.

TI Health in the 'hidden population' of people with low literacy. A
   systematic review of the literature
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article

   SKILLS; WOMEN; ASSOCIATION; ILLITERACY
AB Background: Much of the evidence of an association between low functional or health literacy and poor health comes from studies that include people who have various cognitive difficulties or who do not speak the dominant language of their society. Low functional or health literacy among these people is likely to be evident in spoken conversation. However, many other people can talk readily about health and other issues but have problems using written information. Consequently, their difficulties may be far less evident to healthcare professionals, creating a 'hidden population' whose functional or health literacy problems have different implications because they are less likely to be recognised and addressed.
   We aimed to review published research to investigate relationships between low functional or health literacy and health in working age adults who can converse in the dominant language but have difficulty with written language.
   Methods: We searched reviews and electronic databases for studies that examined health-related outcomes among the population of interest. We systematically extracted data relating to relationships between low functional or health literacy and both health status and various possible mediators or moderators of the implications of literacy for health. We developed a narrative review.
   Results: Twenty-four studies met our inclusion criteria. Lower functional or health literacy in this population was found to be associated with worse health status. This may be mediated by difficulties accessing healthcare, and poorer self-management of health problems. It is currently unclear whether, how or to what extent these difficulties are mediated by poorer knowledge stemming from low functional or health literacy. The variation in functional or health literacy measures and comparisons make it difficult to compare study findings and to establish the implications of different literacy issues for health outcomes.
   Conclusions: There is evidence in the literature that low functional or health literacy is associated with poor health in the 'hidden population' of adults whose literacy difficulties may not be evident to health care providers. Further research is needed to help understand the particular disadvantages faced by this population and to establish appropriate responses.

TI Seeking Health Information What Sources Do Your Patients Use?

AB Healthcare professionals believe that it is important for patients to be educated about health for optimal outcomes. For education to occur, healthcare professionals need to know where patients seek information. The concept of health information-seeking behavior (HISB) focuses on how patients obtain information (strategies/actions). Theories/models are presented to describe how patients obtain information and what they do with information that is available. The most recent HISB research has examined the use of the Internet for health information. Although the Internet is utilized by many individuals, studies show that the most common and trusted source of information is healthcare professionals. Individuals use other sources of health information (e. g., TV, radio, newspaper, magazines, Internet, and family/friends/coworkers) to supplement information provided by healthcare professionals. When and how individuals use supplemental information varies and is associated with many factors such as race, education, income, health literacy, and health status. Utilizing health information also depends on an individual's health orientation. As nurses, we need to utilize knowledge about HISB to assist patients in obtaining health information to optimize health outcomes.

AB Cervical cancer is a preventable disease resulting from infection with high-risk types of sexually transmitted human papillomaviruses (HPVs). Public knowledge of HPV's and their link to cervical cancer is limited. Participation in cervical cancer prevention programs, including Pap and HPV screening and HPV vaccine acceptance, is crucial for limiting the incidence of cervical cancer. Hispanic women suffer the highest cervical cancer incidence rates in the United States. In this study, we conducted community-based focus groups with Hispanic women to explore knowledge and attitudes relating to cervical cancer, HPV, HPV testing, and HPV vaccination. Study findings suggest a need to increase public health literacy in relation to HPV, the link between HPV and cervical cancer, and HPV primary and secondary prevention options. Health care providers should be prepared to share information with patients that supports and promotes informed decision making about HPV testing and vaccines and their complementary roles in cervical cancer screening and prevention.

ID FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY; EDUCATION LITERATURE
AB Background-Warfarin therapy requires frequent monitoring and dose adjustment. Elderly patients with atrial fibrillation, prior stroke, and lower literacy skills may have difficulty reading brochures that explain dosing instructions, procedures to follow, and the risks and benefits of anticoagulants. In general, it is recommended that brochures be written at or below the 6th-grade level. We determined the readability of patient information material being offered to patients receiving anticoagulants.
   Methods and Results-We used the SMOG grade formula to measure readability of written patient materials. We obtained 50 brochures commonly used in anticoagulation management units from industry and health advocacy groups. Patient information was related to atrial fibrillation (16%, n=8), warfarin (44%, n=22), low-molecular-weight heparins (12%, n=6), or other related topics (28%, n=14). The mean readability was found to be grade 10.7 (95% CI 10.1 to 11.2); none had a readability score at the 6th-grade level or below, 12% of the brochures had readability scores at the 7th- to 8th-grade levels (n=6), 74% at the 9th- to 12th-grade levels (n=37), and 14% at higher than 12th-grade level (n=7). The readability grade level was similar for brochures produced by industry or health advocacy groups (P=0.9) but higher for information obtained from the Internet (12.2+/-1.3 grades) compared with other sources (10.3+/-2.1 grades; P=0.01).
   Conclusions-Patient education materials related to the use of anticoagulants are written at grade levels beyond the comprehension of most patients. Low-literacy brochures are needed for patients on anticoagulants.

AB Background: In the United States, disparities in health literacy parallel disparities in health outcomes. Our research contributes to how diverse indicators of social inequalities (i.e., objective social class, relational social class, and social resources) contribute to understanding disparities in health literacy.
   Methods: We analyze data on respondents 18 years of age and older (N = 14,592) from the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) restricted access data set. A series of weighted Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression models estimate the association between respondent's demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status (SES), relational social class, social resources and an Item Response Theory (IRT) based health literacy measure.
   Results: Our findings are consistent with previous research on the social and SES determinants of health literacy. However, our findings reveal the importance of relational social status for understanding health literacy disparities in the United States. Objective indicators of social status are persistent and robust indicators of health literacy. Measures of relational social status such as civic engagement (i.e., voting, volunteering, and library use) are associated with higher health literacy levels net of objective resources. Social resources including speaking English and marital status are associated with higher health literacy levels.
   Conclusions: Relational indicators of social class are related to health literacy independent of objective social class indicators. Civic literacy ( e.g., voting and volunteering) are predictors of health literacy and offer opportunities for health intervention. Our findings support the notion that health literacy is a social construct and suggest the need to develop a theoretically driven conceptual definition of health literacy that includes a civic literacy component.

AB Background: The Internet provides a platform to access health information and support self-management by consumers with chronic health conditions. Despite recognized barriers to accessing Web-based health information, there is a lack of research quantitatively exploring whether consumers report difficulty finding desired health information on the Internet and whether these consumers would like assistance (ie, navigational needs). Understanding navigational needs can provide a basis for interventions guiding consumers to quality Web-based health resources.
   Objective: We aimed to (1) estimate the proportion of consumers with navigational needs among seekers of Web-based health information with chronic health conditions, (2) describe Web-based health information-seeking behaviors, level of patient activation, and level of eHealth literacy among consumers with navigational needs, and (3) explore variables predicting navigational needs.
   Methods: A questionnaire was developed based on findings from a qualitative study on Web-based health information-seeking behaviors and navigational needs. This questionnaire also incorporated the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS; a measure of self-perceived eHealth literacy) and PAM-13 (a measure of patient activation). The target population was consumers of Web-based health information with chronic health conditions. We surveyed a sample of 400 Australian adults, with recruitment coordinated by Qualtrics. This sample size was required to estimate the proportion of consumers identified with navigational needs with a precision of 4.9% either side of the true population value, with 95% confidence. A subsample was invited to retake the survey after 2 weeks to assess the test-retest reliability of the eHEALS and PAM-13.
   Results: Of 514 individuals who met our eligibility criteria, 400 (77.8%) completed the questionnaire and 43 participants completed the retest. Approximately half (51.3%; 95% CI 46.4-56.2) of the population was identified with navigational needs. Participants with navigational needs appeared to look for more types of health information on the Internet and from a greater variety of information sources compared to participants without navigational needs. However, participants with navigational needs were significantly less likely to have high levels of eHealth literacy (adjusted odds ratio=0.83, 95% CI 0.78-0.89, P<.001). Age was also a significant predictor (P=.02).
   Conclusions: Approximately half of the population of consumers of Web-based health information with chronic health conditions would benefit from support in finding health information on the Internet. Despite the popularity of the Internet as a source of health information, further work is recommended to maximize its potential as a tool to assist self-management in consumers with chronic health conditions.

TI A mismatch between population health literacy and the complexity of
   health information: an observational study
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
DE health information; health literacy; numeracy; primary care; public
   health
ID OLDER-ADULTS; MORTALITY
AB Background
   Low health literacy is associated with poorer health and higher mortality. Complex health materials are a barrier to health.
   Aim
   To assess the literacy and numeracy skills required to understand and use commonly used English health information materials, and to describe population skills in relation to these.
   Design and setting
   An English observational study comparing health materials with national working-age population skills.
   Method
   Health materials were sampled using a health literacy framework. Competency thresholds to understand and use the materials were identified. The proportion of the population above and below these thresholds, and the sociodemographic variables associated with a greater risk of being below the thresholds, were described.
   Results
   Sixty-four health materials were sampled. Two competency thresholds were identified: text (literacy) only, and text + numeracy; 2515/5795 participants (43%) were below the text-only threshold, while 2905/4767 (61%) were below the text + numeracy threshold. Univariable analyses of social determinants of health showed that those groups more at risk of socioeconomic deprivation had higher odds of being below the health literacy competency threshold than those at lower risk of deprivation. Multivariable analysis resulted in some variables becoming non-significant or reduced in effect.
   Conclusion
   Levels of low health literacy mirror those found in other industrialised countries, with a mismatch between the complexity of health materials and the skills of the English adult working-age population. Those most in need of health information have the least access to it. Efficacious strategies are building population skills, improving health professionals' communication, and improving written health information.

AB Depression and adherence to antidepressant treatment are important clinical concerns in diabetes care. While patient-provider communication patterns have been associated with adherence for cardiometabolic medications, it is unknown whether interpersonal aspects of care impact antidepressant medication adherence.
   To determine whether shared decision-making, patient-provider trust, or communication are associated with early stage and ongoing antidepressant adherence.
   Observational new prescription cohort study.
   Kaiser Permanente Northern California.
   One thousand five hundred twenty-three adults with type 2 diabetes who completed a survey in 2006 and received a new antidepressant prescription during 2006-2010.
   Exposures included items based on the Trust in Physicians and Interpersonal Processes of Care instruments and the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) communication scale. Measures of adherence were estimated using validated methods with physician prescribing and pharmacy dispensing data: primary non-adherence (medication never dispensed), early non-persistence (dispensed once, never refilled), and new prescription medication gap (NPMG; proportion of time without medication during 12 months after initial prescription).
   After adjusting for potential confounders, patients' perceived lack of shared decision-making was significantly associated with primary non-adherence (RR = 2.42, p < 0.05), early non-persistence (RR = 1.34, p < 0.01) and NPMG (estimated 5 % greater gap in medication supply, p < 0.01). Less trust in provider was significantly associated with early non-persistence (RRs 1.22-1.25, ps < 0.05) and NPMG (estimated NPMG differences 5-8 %, ps < 0.01).
   All patients were insured and had consistent access to and quality of care.
   Patients' perceptions of their relationships with providers, including lack of shared decision-making or trust, demonstrated strong associations with antidepressant non-adherence. Further research should explore whether interventions for healthcare providers and systems that foster shared decision-making and trust might also improve medication adherence.

AB Objective. To investigate whether previously noted associations between health literacy and functional health status might be explained by cognitive function.
   Data Sources/Study Setting. Health Literacy and Cognition in Older Adults ("LitCog," prospective study funded by National Institute on Aging). Data presented are from interviews conducted among 784 adults, ages 55-74 years receiving care at an academic general medicine clinic or one of four federally qualified health centers in Chicago from 2008 to 2010.
   Study Design. Study participants completed structured, in-person interviews administered by trained research assistants.
   Data Collection. Health literacy was measured using the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults, Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine, and Newest Vital Sign. Cognitive function was assessed using measures of long-term and working memory, processing speed, reasoning, and verbal ability. Functional health was assessed with SF-36 physical health summary scale and Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System short form subscales for depression and anxiety.
   Principal Findings. All health literacy measures were significantly correlated with all cognitive domains. In multivariable analyses, inadequate health literacy was associated with worse physical health and more depressive symptoms. After adjusting for cognitive abilities, associations between health literacy, physical health, and depressive symptoms were attenuated and no longer significant.
   Conclusions. Cognitive function explains a significant proportion of the associations between health literacy, physical health, and depression among older adults. Interventions to reduce literacy disparities in health care should minimize the cognitive burden in behaviors patients must adopt to manage personal health.

AB Objectives: To examine relationships among health literacy, self-efficacy, food label use, and dietary quality in young adults aged 18-29. Methods: Health literacy, self-efficacy, food label use, and dietary quality were assessed. Participants were categorized into low, medium and high health literacy groups based on Newest Vital Sign score. Results: Self-efficacy and health literacy were predictors of food label use, which positively predicted dietary quality. The low health literacy group had significantly lower use of food labels than the high health literacy group. However, there was no significant difference between medium and high health literacy groups. Conclusion: Strategies to enhance health literacy, self-efficacy and food label use should be developed to improve dietary quality and health outcomes.

AB Background: Alcohol use disorders are highly prevalent worldwide. However, only a minority with alcohol dependence seek and undergo treatment. From a public health perspective, it is important to understand why people do not seek treatment. Objectives: This study aims to describe how people with alcohol dependence perceive and discuss treatment for alcohol use disorders and their reasons for seeking and not seeking treatment. Methods: 32 alcohol dependent adults from the general population participated in focus groups and individual interviews in Stockholm during 2011-2012. Data were analyzed with thematic content analysis. Results: Suffering from alcohol dependence, as well as realizing the need for, and entering treatment, were associated with shame and stigma, and were strong barriers to treatment. Other barriers included the desire to deal with alcohol problems on one's own and the view that seeking treatment required total abstinence. Negative health-effects were mainly a non-issue. The participants' knowledge about treatment options was limited to lifelong abstinence, medication with Disulfiram and residential treatment. These were seen as unappealing and contrasted sharply with preferred treatment. Conclusions/Importance: Public health literacy regarding alcohol use, dependence, and treatment ought to be improved in order to lower barriers to treatment. Treatment services need to better match the needs and wishes of potential service users, as well as taking stigmatization into account. In order to develop suitable treatments, and to reach the majority who do not seek treatment, the clinical understanding of alcohol dependence needs to be expanded to include mild to moderate dependence.

AB Background: Stigmatizing attitudes toward depression and toward help-seeking are important barriers for people with mental health problems to obtain adequate professional help. This study aimed to examine: (1) population attitudes toward depression and toward seeking professional help in four European countries; (2) the relation between depression stigma and attitudes toward help-seeking; (3) the relation between both attitudes and socio-demographic characteristics; and (4) differences in attitudes across countries.
   Methods: A representative general population survey (n=4011) was conducted in Germany, Hungary, Ireland, and Portugal, assessing attitudes toward depression and toward help-seeking, and a number of socio-demographic variables.
   Results: Respondents showed a moderate degree of personal stigma toward depression and a strikingly higher degree of perceived stigma. Although a substantial majority showed openness to seek professional help, only half of the people perceived professional help as valuable. More negative attitudes were found in Hungary and were associated with male gender, older age, lower educational level and living alone. Also, personal stigma was related to less openness to and less perceived value of professional treatment.
   Limitations: The survey was cross-sectional, so no causal inferences could be drawn.
   Conclusions: Personal and perceived stigma toward depression deserves public health attention, since they impact upon the intention of people with depression to seek professional help. Public media campaigns should focus on the credibility of the mental health care sector, and target males, older people, and those with a lower educational level and living alone. The content of each campaign should be adapted to the cultural norms of the country for which it is intended. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Responding to diversity: An exploratory study of migrant health policies

SO HEALTH POLICY
LA English
DT Article

ID NETHERLANDS; CARE
AB There has been growing international attention to migrant health, reflecting recognition of the need for health systems to adapt to increasingly diverse populations. However, reports from health policy experts in 25 European countries suggest that by 2009 only eleven countries had established national policies to improve migrant health that go beyond migrants' statutory or legal entitlement to care. The objective of this paper is to compare and contrast the content of these policies and analyse their strengths and limitations. The analysis suggests that most of the national policies target either migrants or more established ethnic minorities. Countries should address the diverse needs of both groups and could learn from "intercultural" health care policies in Ireland and, in the past, the Netherlands. Policies in several countries prioritise specific diseases or conditions, but these differ and it is not clear whether they accurately reflect real differences in need among countries. Policy initiatives typically involve training health workers, providing interpreter services and/or 'cultural mediators', adapting organizational culture, improving data collection and providing information to migrants on health problems and services. A few countries stand out for their quest to increase migrants' health literacy and their participation in the development and implementation of policy. Progressive migrant health policies are not always sustainable as they can be undermined or even reversed when political contexts change. The analysis of migrant health policies in Europe is still in its infancy and there is an urgent need to monitor the implementation and evaluate the effectiveness of these diverse policies.

TI Prevention and early intervention to improve mental health in higher

   PERSONALIZED-FEEDBACK; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS
AB Background: The age at which most young people are in higher education is also the age of peak onset for mental and substance use disorders, with these having their first onset before age 24 in 75% of cases. In most developed countries, over 50% of young people are in higher education.
   Aims: To review the evidence for prevention and early intervention in mental health problems in higher education students. The review was limited to interventions targeted to anxiety, depression and alcohol misuse.
   Methods: Interventions to review were identified by searching PubMed, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Interventions were included if they were designed to specifically prevent or intervene early in the general (nonhealth professional) higher education student population, in one or more of the following areas: anxiety, depression or alcohol misuse symptoms, mental health literacy, stigma and one or more behavioural outcomes.
   Results: For interventions to prevent or intervene early for alcohol misuse, evidence of effectiveness is strongest for brief motivational interventions and for personalized normative interventions delivered using computers or in individual face-to-face sessions. Few interventions to prevent or intervene early with depression or anxiety were identified. These were mostly face-to-face, cognitive-behavioural/skill-based interventions. One social marketing intervention to raise awareness of depression and treatments showed some evidence of effectiveness.
   Conclusions: There is very limited evidence that interventions are effective in preventing or intervening early with depression and anxiety disorders in higher education students. Further studies, possibly involving interventions that have shown promise in other populations, are needed.

AB To better understand national patterns of invasive cervical cancer (ICC) incidence by race and ethnicity in order to develop appropriate ICC prevention policies.
   Age-adjusted and age-specific ICC incidence rates were calculated by combined race/ethnicity, making distinct the Hispanic/all races category from three other Non-Hispanic (White, Black and other) racial categories.
   There was a significant downward trend in ICC incidence during both time periods for every combination of race/ethnicity (p-value < 0.05) except Hispanic/all races during 1995-1999. Non-Hispanic/Black and Hispanic/all races women had significantly higher incidence rates of ICC compared to Non-Hispanic/White women. ICC incidence peaked much earlier for Non-Hispanic/White women (35-44 years of age) compared to any other racial/ethnic group. Non-Hispanic (White, Black and other) women had lower rates of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma compared to Hispanic/all races women. Non-Hispanic/Black and Hispanic/all races women were more likely to be diagnosed at late stage or unstaged at diagnosis than Non-Hispanic/White women.
   Although ICC incidence decreased significantly over the last 10 years, Black or Hispanic US populations continue to have the highest ICC incidence compared to Non-Hispanic/Whites, highlighting the need for improved health literacy and social support to ensure their equal access to ICC screening and HPV prevention including HPV vaccination.

AB Background. Many people who are depressed do not receive any professional help and their beliefs about the helpfulness of treatment do not always correspond with those of health professionals. To facilitate choices about treatment, the present study examined the effects of providing depressed people in the community with evidence on whether various treatment options work.
   Method. A randomized controlled trial was carried out with 1094 persons selected at random from the community who screened positive for depressive symptoms and agreed to participate. Participants were mailed either an evidence-based consumer guide to treatments for depression or, as a control, a general brochure on depression. Outcomes were the rated usefulness of the information provided, changes in attitudes to depression treatments, actions taken to reduce depression, and changes in depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and disability.
   Results. Participants rated the evidence-based consumer guide as more useful than the control brochure. Attitudes to some treatments changed. Improvements in symptoms and disability did not differ significantly between interventions.
   Conclusion. Providing people who are depressed with evidence on which treatments work produces some changes in attitudes and behaviour. However, this intervention may need to be enhanced if it is to produce symptom change.

TI Food Literacy: Definition and Framework for Action
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF DIETETIC PRACTICE AND RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH LITERACY; HOME ECONOMICS; NUTRITION; EDUCATION
AB The term food literacy is emergent, and as a result the literature reflects a great variety of definitions. Simultaneously, new research and food literacy programming is being developed without an agreed upon definition of what food literacy is and how food skills, food security, and health literacy may fit with the definition. We undertook a scoping review and conceptual analysis to identify how the term is understood and to determine shared components of definitions. We found that although most definitions included a nutrition and food skills component, there was great variation in how the ability to access, process, and enjoy food was affected by our complex food system. We propose a definition of food literacy that includes the positive relationship built through social, cultural, and environmental experiences with food enabling people to make decisions that support health. We offer a framework that situates food literacy at the intersection between community food security and food skills, and we assert that behaviours and skills cannot be separated from their environmental or social context. The proposed definition and framework are intended to be guiding templates for academics and practitioners to position their work in education and advocacy, bringing together separate spheres for collective action.

AB Background: Refugees have poorer health compared to indigenous populations, which may be explained by lower health literacy, i.e. not being able to access, understand, appraise or apply health information. This study aims to determine levels of functional and comprehensive health literacy, and factors associated with inadequate health literacy, in refugees coming to Sweden.
   Method: A cross-sectional study was performed among 455 adult refugees speaking Arabic, Dari, Somali or English. Participants in 16 strategically selected language schools for immigrants responded to a questionnaire. Health literacy was measured using the Swedish Functional Health Literacy Scale and the HLS-EU-Q16 questionnaire. Uni- and multivariate statistical methods were used to investigate group differences.
   Results: The majority of the participating refugees had inadequate or limited functional health literacy and comprehensive health literacy. About 60% of them had inadequate functional health literacy and 27% had inadequate comprehensive health literacy. Low education and/or being born in Somalia were factors associated with an increased risk of having inadequate functional health literacy. Having inadequate functional health literacy was associated with an increased risk of having inadequate comprehensive health literacy.
   Conclusions: The majority of refugees in the language schools had limited or poor health literacy. Health literacy should be taken into consideration in contexts and in activities addressing migrants. More research is needed to better understand health literacy among refugees and to develop strategies and methods to increase health literacy and make life easier for those with low health literacy.

TI Teaching the Use of Respiratory Inhalers to Hospitalized Patients with

AB Hospitalized patients frequently misuse their respiratory inhalers, yet it is unclear what the most effective hospital-based educational intervention is for this population.
   To compare two strategies for teaching inhaler use to hospitalized patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
   A Phase-II randomized controlled clinical trial enrolled hospitalized adults with physician diagnosed asthma or COPD.
   Hospitalized adults (age 18 years or older) with asthma or COPD.
   Participants were randomized to brief intervention [BI]: single-set of verbal and written step-by-step instructions, or, teach-to-goal [TTG]: BI plus repeated demonstrations of inhaler use and participant comprehension assessments (teach-back).
   The primary outcome was metered-dose inhaler (MDI) misuse post-intervention (< 75% steps correct). Secondary outcomes included DiskusA (R) misuse, self-reported inhaler technique confidence and prevalence of 30-day health-related events.
   Of 80 eligible participants, fifty (63%) were enrolled (BI n = 26, TTG n = 24). While the majority of participants reported being confident with their inhaler technique (MDI 70%, DiskusA (R) 94%), most misused their inhalers pre-intervention (MDI 62%, DiskusA (R) 78%). Post-intervention MDI misuse was significantly lower after TTG vs. BI (12.5 vs. 46%, p = 0.01). The results for DiskusA (R) were similar and approached significance (25 vs. 80%, p = 0.05). Participants with 30-day acute health-related events were less common in the group receiving TTG vs. BI (1 vs. 8, p = 0.02).
   TTG appears to be more effective compared with BI. Patients over-estimate their inhaler technique, emphasizing the need for hospital-based interventions to correct inhaler misuse. Although TTG was associated with fewer post-hospitalization health-related events, larger, multi-centered studies are needed to evaluate the durability and clinical outcomes associated with this hospital-based education.

SO ONCOLOGIST

ID STAGE BREAST-CANCER; INFORMED DECISION; TRIAL
AB The Institute of Medicine's National Cancer Policy Forum recently convened a workshop on patient-centered cancer treatment planning, with the aim of raising awareness about this important but often overlooked aspect of cancer treatment. A primary goal of patient-centered treatment planning is to engage patients and their families in meaningful, thorough interactions with their health care providers to develop an accurate, well-conceived treatment plan, using all available medical information appropriately while also considering the medical, social, and cultural needs and desires of the patient and family. A cancer treatment plan can be shared among the patient, family, and care team in order to facilitate care coordination and provide a roadmap to help patients navigate the path of cancer treatment. There are numerous obstacles to achieving patient-centered cancer treatment planning in practice. Some of these challenges stem from the patient and include patients' lack of assertiveness, health literacy, and numeracy, and their emotional state and concurrent illnesses. Others are a result of physician limitations, such as a lack of time to explain complex information and a lack of tools to facilitate treatment planning, as well as insensitivity to patients' informational, cultural, and emotional needs. Potential solutions to address these obstacles include better training of health care providers and patients in optimal communication and shared decision making, and greater use of support services and tools such as patient navigation and electronic health records. Other options include greater use of quality metrics and reimbursement for the time it takes to develop, discuss, and document a treatment plan. The Oncologist 2011;16:1800-1805

AB Background: Online pharmacies are companies that sell pharmaceutical preparations, including prescription-only drugs, on the Internet. Very little is known about this phenomenon because many online pharmacies operate from remote countries, where legal bases and business practices are largely inaccessible to international research.
   Objective: The aim of the study was to perform an up-to-date and comprehensive review of the scientific literature focusing on the broader picture of online pharmacies by scanning several scientific and institutional databases, with no publication time limits.
   Methods: We searched 4 electronic databases up to January 2011 and the gray literature on the Internet using the Google search engine and its tool Google Scholar. We also investigated the official websites of institutional agencies (World Health Organization, and US and European centers for disease control and drug regulation authorities). We focused specifically on online pharmacies offering prescription-only drugs. We decided to analyze and report only articles with original data, in order to review all the available data regarding online pharmacies and their usage.
   Results: We selected 193 relevant articles: 76 articles with original data, and 117 articles without original data (editorials, regulation articles, or the like) including 5 reviews. The articles with original data cover samples of online pharmacies in 47 cases, online drug purchases in 13, consumer characteristics in 15, and case reports on adverse effects of online drugs in 12. The studies show that random samples with no specific limits to prescription requirements found that at least some websites sold drugs without a prescription and that an online questionnaire was a frequent tool to replace prescription. Data about geographical characteristics show that this information can be concealed in many websites. The analysis of drug offer showed that online a consumer can get virtually everything. Regarding quality of drugs, researchers very often found inappropriate packaging and labeling, whereas the chemical composition usually was not as expected in a minority of the studies' samples. Regarding consumers, the majority of studies found that not more than 6% of the samples had bought drugs online.
   Conclusions: Online pharmacies are an important phenomenon that is continuing to spread, despite partial regulation, due to intrinsic difficulties linked to the impalpable and evanescent nature of the Web and its global dimension. To enhance the benefits and minimize the risks of online pharmacies, a 2-level approach could be adopted. The first level should focus on policy, with laws regulating the phenomenon at an international level. The second level needs to focus on the individual. This approach should aim to increase health literacy, required for making appropriate health choices, recognizing risks and making the most of the multitude of opportunities offered by the world of medicine 2.0.

AB PURPOSE Limited health literacy is increasingly recognized as a barrier to receiving adequate health care. Identifying patients at risk of poor health outcomes secondary to limited health literacy is currently the responsibility of clinicians. Our objective was to identify which screening questions and demographics independently predict limited health literacy and could thus help clinicians individualize their patient education.
   METHODS Between August 2006 and July 2007, we asked 225 patients being treated for diabetes at an academic primary care office several questions regarding their reading ability as part of a larger study (57% response rate). We built a logistic regression model predicting limited health literacy to determine the independent predictive properties of these questions and demographic variables. Patients were classified as having limited health literacy if they had a Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA) score of less than 23. The potential predictors evaluated were self-rated reading ability, highest education level attained, Single-Item Literacy Screener (SILS) result, patients' reading enjoyment, age, sex, and race.
   RESULTS Overall, 15.1% of the patients had limited health literacy. In the final model, 5 of the potential predictors were independently associated with increased odds of having limited health literacy. Specifically, patients were more likely to have limited health literacy if they had a poorer self-rated reading ability (odds ratio [OR] per point increase in the model = 3.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.71-6.63), more frequently needed help reading written health materials (assessed by the SILS) (OR = 2.03; 95% CI, 1.26-3.26), had a lower education level (OR = 1.89; 95% CI, 1.12-3.18), were male (OR = 4.46; 95% CI, 1.53-12.99), and were of nonwhite race (OR = 3.73; 95% CI, 1.04-13.40). These associations were not confounded by age. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.9212.
   CONCLUSIONS Self-rated reading ability, SILS result, highest education level attained, sex, and race independently predict whether a patient has limited health literacy. Clinicians should be aware of these associations and ask questions to identify patients at risk. We propose an "SOS" mnemonic based on these findings to help clinicians wishing to individualize patient education.

AB We investigated health literacy and its association with the use of information sources and with barriers to information seeking in clinic-based pregnant women. The Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (STOFHLA) was used to measure health literacy in 143 English-speaking low-income pregnant women. About 15% of the participants demonstrated low health literacy. Participants with low health literacy were less likely to use the Internet and more likely to have self-efficacy barriers than participants with high health literacy. Interventions to promote information-seeking skills and Internet access are indicated for women with low health literacy.

AB Background: Prostate cancer screening (PCS) is controversial. Ideally, patients should understand the risks and benefits of screening before undergoing PSA testing. This study assessed whether primary care physicians routinely discuss PCS and explored the barriers to and facilitators of these discussions.
   Methods: Qualitative pilot study involving in-depth, semistructured interviews with 18 purposively sampled, academic and community-based primary care physicians. Barriers and facilitators of PCS discussions were ascertained using both interviews and chart-stimulated recall-a technique utilizing patient charts to probe recall and provide context to physician decision-making during clinic encounters. Analysis was performed using consensus conferences based on grounded theory techniques.
   Results: All 18 participating physicians reported that they generally discussed PCS with patients, though 6 reported sometimes ordering PSA tests without discussion. A PCS discussion occurred in only 16 (36%) of the 44 patient-physician encounters when patients were due for PCS that also met criteria for chart-stimulated recall. Barriers to PCS discussion were patient comorbidity, limited education/health literacy, prior refusal of care, physician forgetfulness, acute-care visits, and lack of time. Facilitators of PCS discussion included patient-requested screening, highly educated patients, family history of prostate cancer, African-American race, visits for routine physicals, review of previous PSA results, extra time during encounters, and reminder systems.
   Conclusions: PCS discussions sometimes do not occur. Important barriers to discussion are inadequate time for health maintenance, physician forgetfulness, and patient characteristics. Future research should explore using educational and decision support interventions to involve more patients in PCS decisions.

AB An important goal of health promotion is to make it easier for people to make healthy choices. However, this may be difficult if people do not feel control over their environment and their personal circumstances. An important concept in relation to this is empowerment. Health professionals are expected to facilitate and enable people moving towards empowerment. In this paper, we address the question what is meant by individual empowerment. In an attempt to provide a theoretical framework, we discuss individual empowerment from a salutogenic perspective. This perspective introduces two fundamental concepts: the general resistance resources, and the sense of coherence. In addition, in order to further clarify and operationalise the concept, some factors influencing individual empowerment are identified, that is, locus of control, learned helplessness, self-efficacy and outcome expectations. These concepts find common ground in feelings of (lack of) control, but they differ in stability and changeability. We provide some suggestions how these factors can be influenced, and we discuss the meaning of the identified factors for empowering interactions between professionals and their clients. Health professionals can facilitate people to see a correspondence between their efforts and the outcomes thereof, improve and facilitate health literacy, in a relationship which can be characterised as partnership.

AB Background: Electronic health information (eHealth) tools for patients, including patient-accessible electronic medical records (patient portals), are proliferating in health care delivery systems nationally. However, there has been very limited study of the perceived utility and functionality of portals, as well as limited assessment of these systems by vulnerable (low education level, racial/ethnic minority) consumers.
   Objective: The objective of the study was to identify vulnerable consumers' response to patient portals, their perceived utility and value, as well as their reactions to specific portal functions.
   Methods: This qualitative study used 4 focus groups with 28 low education level, English-speaking consumers in June and July 2010, in New York City.
   Results: Participants included 10 males and 18 females, ranging in age from 21-63 years; 19 non-Hispanic black, 7 Hispanic, 1 non-Hispanic White and 1 Other. None of the participants had higher than a high school level education, and 13 had less than a high school education. All participants had experience with computers and 26 used the Internet. Major themes were enhanced consumer engagement/patient empowerment, extending the doctor's visit/enhancing communication with health care providers, literacy and health literacy factors, improved prevention and health maintenance, and privacy and security concerns. Consumers were also asked to comment on a number of key portal features. Consumers were most positive about features that increased convenience, such as making appointments and refilling prescriptions. Consumers raised concerns about a number of potential barriers to usage, such as complex language, complex visual layouts, and poor usability features.
   Conclusions: Most consumers were enthusiastic about patient portals and perceived that they had great utility and value. Study findings suggest that for patient portals to be effective for all consumers, portals must be designed to be easy to read, visually engaging, and have user-friendly navigation.

AB The Internet has the potential to increase the capacity and accessibility of mental health services. This study aimed to investigate whether an unguided Internet-based self-help intervention delivered without human support or guidance can reduce symptoms of depression in young people at risk of depression. The study also aimed to explore the usage of such sites in a real-life setting, to estimate the effects of the intervention for those who received a meaningful intervention dose and to evaluate user satisfaction. Young adults were recruited by means of a screening survey sent to all students at the University of Tromso. Of those responding to the survey, 163 students (mean age 28.2 years) with elevated psychological distress were recruited to the trial and randomized to an Internet intervention condition or the waiting list control group. The Internet condition comprised a depression information website and a self-help Web application delivering automated cognitive behavioural therapy. The participants in the waiting list condition were free to access formal or informal help as usual. Two-thirds of the users who completed the trial initially reported an unmet need for help. The findings demonstrated that an unguided intervention was effective in reducing symptoms of depression and negative thoughts and in increasing depression literacy in young adults. Significant improvements were found at 2-month follow up. Internet-based interventions can be effective without tracking and thus constitute a minimal cost intervention for reaching a large number of people. User satisfaction among participants was high. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message Internet-based self-help can be useful for early intervention among people experiencing elevated depressive symptoms. The present trial demonstrated that an unguided intervention can be effective in reducing depressive symptoms. The Internet-based intervention has the potential of reaching a target group with an unmet need for help. Approximately 27% of users referred to the site completed on average 55% of the intervention.

AB Background: Pictorial health warning labels on cigarette packaging have been proposed for the U.S., but their potential influences among populations that suffer tobacco-related health disparities are unknown.
   Purpose: To evaluate pictorial health warning labels, including moderation of their influences by health literacy and race.
   Methods: From July 2011 to January 2012, field experiments were conducted with 981 adult smokers who were randomized to control (i.e., text-only labels, n = 207) and experimental conditions (i.e., pictorial labels, n = 774). The experimental condition systematically varied health warning label stimuli by health topic and image type. Linear mixed effects (LME) models estimated the influence of health warning label characteristics and participant characteristics on label ratings. Data were analyzed from January 2012 to April 2012.
   Results: Compared to text-only warning labels, pictorial warning labels were rated as more personally relevant (5.7 vs 6.8, p < 0.001) and effective (5.4 vs 6.8, p < 0.001), and as more credible, but only among participants with low health literacy (7.6 vs 8.2, p < 0.001). Within the experimental condition, pictorial health warning labels with graphic imagery had significantly higher ratings of credibility, personal relevance, and effectiveness than imagery of human suffering and symbolic imagery. Significant interactions indicated that labels with graphic imagery produced minimal differences in ratings across racial groups and levels of health literacy, whereas other imagery produced greater group differences.
   Conclusions: Pictorial health warning labels with graphic images have the most-pronounced short-term impacts on adult smokers, including smokers from groups that have in the past been hard to reach. (Am J Prev Med 2012;43(6):590-600) (C) 2012 American Journal of Preventive Medicine

TI Factors influencing self-management in chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease: An integrative review
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES
LA English
DT Review
DE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Self-management; Self-care;
   Theoretical framework
ID COPD PATIENTS; OLDER-ADULTS; PRIMARY-CARE; LIFE; REHABILITATION;
   PERCEPTIONS; EDUCATION; BEHAVIOR; SUPPORT; PEOPLE
AB Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a common, chronic and burden-some condition requiring the individual to engage in a range of self-management strategies. The capacity to engage in self-management is dependent on a range of internal (e.g. personal) and external (e.g. health service) factors.
   Objectives: This paper seeks to define self-management, identify the determinants which influence the individual's ability to cope and adjust to living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the community, and identify implications for clinical practice and research.
   Design: Integrative review.
   Data sources: Medline, Embase, PubMed, CINAHL, Google Scholar.
   Review methods: Integrative review using prospective research questions. Papers were included in the review if they were published in peer reviewed journals and written in English between 2000 and 2010. Articles were accepted for inclusion if they discussed the determinants that influenced self-management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the community. Confirmation of results and discussion themes was validated by specialists in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and complex care.
   Findings: Self-management is less well characterised in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease compared with other chronic conditions. Functional limitation and the need to balance disease management with everyday life are the two key elements that patients face in managing their condition. Provider characteristics, socioeconomic status and health literacy are sparsely discussed yet are known to influence chronic obstructive pulmonary disease self-management.
   Conclusions: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease self-management must be a key focus internationally as the disease incidence increases. Collaborative care is required between patients and health providers in order facilitate patients in confident management of their condition. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A Framework for Characterizing eHealth Literacy Demands and Barriers

AB Background: Consumer eHealth interventions are of a growing importance in the individual management of health and health behaviors. However, a range of access, resources, and skills barriers prevent health care consumers from fully engaging in and benefiting from the spectrum of eHealth interventions. Consumers may engage in a range of eHealth tasks, such as participating in health discussion forums and entering information into a personal health record. eHealth literacy names a set of skills and knowledge that are essential for productive interactions with technology-based health tools, such as proficiency in information retrieval strategies, and communicating health concepts effectively.
   Objective: We propose a theoretical and methodological framework for characterizing complexity of eHealth tasks, which can be used to diagnose and describe literacy barriers and inform the development of solution strategies.
   Methods: We adapted and integrated two existing theoretical models relevant to the analysis of eHealth literacy into a single framework to systematically categorize and describe task demands and user performance on tasks needed by health care consumers in the information age. The method derived from the framework is applied to (1) code task demands using a cognitive task analysis, and (2) code user performance on tasks. The framework and method are applied to the analysis of a Web-based consumer eHealth task with information-seeking and decision-making demands. We present the results from the in-depth analysis of the task performance of a single user as well as of 20 users on the same task to illustrate both the detailed analysis and the aggregate measures obtained and potential analyses that can be performed using this method.
   Results: The analysis shows that the framework can be used to classify task demands as well as the barriers encountered in user performance of the tasks. Our approach can be used to (1) characterize the challenges confronted by participants in performing the tasks, (2) determine the extent to which application of the framework to the cognitive task analysis can predict and explain the problems encountered by participants, and (3) inform revisions to the framework to increase accuracy of predictions.
   Conclusions: The results of this illustrative application suggest that the framework is useful for characterizing task complexity and for diagnosing and explaining barriers encountered in task completion. The framework and analytic approach can be a potentially powerful generative research platform to inform development of rigorous eHealth examination and design instruments, such as to assess eHealth competence, to design and evaluate consumer eHealth tools, and to develop an eHealth curriculum.

AB Background: Advance directive law may compromise the clinical effectiveness of advance directives.
   Purpose: To identify unintended legal consequences of advance directive law that may prevent patients from communicating end-of-life preferences.
   Data Sources: Advance directive legal statutes for all 50 U. S. states and the District of Columbia and English-language searches of LexisNexis, Westlaw, and MEDLINE from 1966 to August 2010.
   Study Selection: Two independent reviewers selected 51 advance directive statutes and 20 articles. Three independent legal reviewers selected 105 legal proceedings.
   Data Extraction: Two reviewers independently assessed data sources and used critical content analysis to determine legal barriers to the clinical effectiveness of advance directives. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.
   Data Synthesis: Legal and content-related barriers included poor readability (that is, laws in all states were written above a 12th-grade reading level), health care agent or surrogate restrictions (for example, 40 states did not include same-sex or domestic partners as default surrogates), and execution requirements needed to make forms legally valid (for example, 35 states did not allow oral advance directives, and 48 states required witness signatures, a notary public, or both). Vulnerable populations most likely to be affected by these barriers included patients with limited literacy, limited English proficiency, or both who cannot read or execute advance directives; same-sex or domestic partners who may be without legally valid and trusted surrogates; and unbefriended, institutionalized, or homeless patients who may be without witnesses and suitable surrogates.
   Limitation: Only appellate-level legal cases were available, which may have excluded relevant cases.
   Conclusion: Unintended negative consequences of advance directive legal restrictions may prevent all patients, and particularly vulnerable patients, from making and communicating their end-of-life wishes and having them honored. These restrictions have rendered advance directives less clinically useful. Recommendations include improving readability, allowing oral advance directives, and eliminating witness or notary requirements.

AB This article addresses use of the Internet and Web 2.0 technologies by racial and ethnic minorities and explores the potential opportunities and challenges in leveraging Web 2.0 approaches to impact health disparities. These opportunities and challenges include developing approaches and methods to (a) identify strategies for integrating social media into health promotion interventions focused on major health-related issues that affect members of medically underserved groups; (b) amalgamate techniques to leverage and connect social-media technologies to other evidence-informed online resources; (c) integrate health communication best practices, including addressing health literacy issues; (d) capitalize on social networking to enhance access and communication with health care providers; and (e) advance current efforts and ongoing expansion of research participation by individuals from underserved communities.

AB Development of appropriate and clear guidelines for proper use of neuropsychological tests among ethnic minorities is a current and significant challenge. Although development of race/ethnicity-specific norms is popular, it is also controversial. Some have argued that these norms will improve the sensitivity and specificity of neuropsychological measures in detecting cognitive impairment. However, two major arguments have surfaced that: (1) race-specific norms ignore underlying cultural and educational factors for which race serves as a proxy, and (2) setting "more lenient" cutoffs for impairment among ethnic minorities denies these groups needed services. In this paper, we argue that recent research on hypertension reveals a number of crucial lessons for neuropsychologists who are struggling with this issue. The model of hypertension is helpful in understanding issues of construct validity in neuropsychological testing, and is also helpful in revealing possible underlying causes of poor cognitive test performance for which race serves as a proxy.

AB Mental health systems in many countries are seriously under-developed, yet mental health problems not only have huge consequences for quality of life, but - particularly in low- and middle-income countries - contribute to continued economic burden and reinforce poverty. This paper discusses economic barriers to improving the availability, accessibility, efficiency and equity of mental health care in low- and middle-income countries. Six sets of barriers are identified: an information barrier, resource insufficiency, resource distribution, resource inappropriateness, resource inflexibility and resource timing. Overcoming these barriers will be a major task, although there is no shortage of suggestions for action. The paper discusses broadening the evidence base, improving mental health literacy, tackling stigma, improving financing mechanisms, prioritizing and protecting mental health care budgets, emphasizing mental health promotion through the development of resilience, exploring routes to improved equity, experimenting with new arrangements for purchasing and delivering services, improving coordination between agencies and professionals at both macro- and micro-levels, building alliances between public and private sectors, and training and mobilizing primary care services to improve identification and treatment of mental health problems.

TI Public health literacy in America - An ethical imperative
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
LA English
DT Review
ID HOSPITAL ADMISSION; CHRONIC DISEASE; CARE; KNOWLEDGE; ENROLLEES; RISK
AB One of public health professionals' major challenges is to provide the public with messages that are understandable and based on science. Traditionally, public health communication efforts have focused on the science behind the message rather than on how the information should be communicated and whether the message is understood. With more than one third of the U.S. population struggling with low health literacy, ensuring that individuals understand critical health messages is an ethical imperative for public health agencies, organizations, and professionals. This paper explores the ethical implications of public health literacy and the steps the public health community needs to take to promote a society that is public health literate. (Am J Prev Med 2005;28 (3):317-322) (c) 2005 American journal of Preventive Medicine.

AB Background: The United States Department of Veterans Affairs has implemented an electronic asynchronous "Secure Messaging" tool within a Web-based patient portal (ie, My HealtheVet) to support patient-provider communication. This electronic resource promotes continuous and coordinated patient-centered care, but to date little research has evaluated patients' experiences and preferences for using Secure Messaging.
   Objective: The objectives of this mixed-methods study were to (1) characterize veterans' experiences using Secure Messaging in the My HealtheVet portal over a 3-month period, including system usability, (2) identify barriers to and facilitators of use, and (3) describe strategies to support veterans' use of Secure Messaging.
   Methods: We recruited 33 veterans who had access to and had previously used the portal's Secure Messaging tool. We used a combination of in-depth interviews, face-to-face user-testing, review of transmitted secure messages between veterans and staff, and telephone interviews three months following initial contact. We assessed participants' computer and health literacy during initial and follow-up interviews. We used a content-analysis approach to identify dominant themes in the qualitative data. We compared inferences from each of the data sources (interviews, user-testing, and message review) to identify convergent and divergent data trends.
   Results: The majority of veterans (27/33, 82%) reported being satisfied with Secure Messaging at initial interview; satisfaction ratings increased to 97% (31/32, 1 missing) during follow-up interviews. Veterans noted Secure Messaging to be useful for communicating with their primary care team to manage health care needs (eg, health-related questions, test requests and results, medication refills and questions, managing appointments). Four domains emerged from interviews: (1) perceived benefits of using Secure Messaging, (2) barriers to using Secure Messaging, (3) facilitators for using Secure Messaging, and (4) suggestions for improving Secure Messaging. Veterans identified and demonstrated impediments to successful system usage that can be addressed with education, skill building, and system modifications. Analysis of secure message content data provided insights to reasons for use that were not disclosed by participants during interviews, specifically sensitive health topics such as erectile dysfunction and sexually transmitted disease inquiries.
   Conclusions: Veterans perceive Secure Messaging in the My HealtheVet patient portal as a useful tool for communicating with health care teams. However, to maximize sustained utilization of Secure Messaging, marketing, education, skill building, and system modifications are needed. Data from this study can inform a large-scale quantitative assessment of Secure Messaging users' experiences in a representative sample to validate qualitative findings.

AB Objectives/HypothesisPatients are increasingly using the Internet as a source of information on medical conditions. Because the average American adult reads at a 7th- to 8th-grade level, the National Institutes of Health recommend that patient education material be written between a 4th- and 6th-grade level. In this study, we assess and compare the readability of patient education materials on major surgical subspecialty Web sites relative to otolaryngology.
   Study DesignDescriptive and correlational design.
   MethodsPatient education materials from 14 major surgical subspecialty Web sites (American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons, American Association of Endocrine Surgeons, American Society of General Surgeons, American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, American Association of Neurological Surgeons, American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Academy of Ophthalmology, American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, American Pediatric Surgical Association, American Society of Plastic Surgeons, Society for Thoracic Surgeons, and American Urological Association) were downloaded and assessed for their level of readability using 10 widely accepted readability scales.
   ResultsThe readability level of patient education material from all surgical subspecialties was uniformly too high. Average readability levels across all subspecialties ranged from the 10th- to 15th-grade level.
   ConclusionsOtolaryngology and other surgical subspecialties Web sites have patient education material written at an education level that the average American may not be able to understand. To reach a broader population of patients, it might be necessary to rewrite patient education material at a more appropriate level.

AB The purpose of this school-based cluster-randomized trial was to determine the initial acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of an existing community-based intervention, In Our Own Voice, in a sample of US adolescent girls aged 13-17 years (n = 156). In Our Own Voice is a knowledge-contact intervention that provides knowledge about mental illness to improve mental health literacy and facilitates intergroup contact with persons with mental illness as a means to reduce mental illness stigma. This longitudinal study was set in two public high schools located in a southern urban community of the U.S. Outcomes included measures of mental illness stigma and mental health literacy. Findings support the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention for adolescents who enrolled in the study. Findings to support the efficacy of In Our own Voice to reduce stigma and improve mental health literacy are mixed. The intervention did not reduce mental illness stigma or improve mental health literacy at one week follow up. The intervention did not reduce mental illness stigma at 4 and 8 weeks follow up. The intervention did improve mental health literacy at 4 and 8 weeks follow up. Previous studies have assessed the preliminary efficacy In Our Own Voice among young adults; rarely has In Our Own Voice been investigated longitudinally and with adolescents in the United States. This study provides initial data on the effects of In Our Own Voice for this population and can be used to further adapt the intervention for adolescents. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   papillomavirus; knowledge

AB Objective: To assess students' human papillomavirus (HPV) knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Participants/Methods: Students (N = 1.282) at a large, public University in the Northeast United States completed a questionnaire during February 2008 assessing HPV knowledge, prevalence, transmission, cervical cancer risk and stigma; sexual behavior, vaccination status, as well as past and preferred sources of information about HPV and sexual health. Results: A majority of respondents know of HPV. However, understanding was insufficient in several important areas. Overwhelmingly, respondents heard about HPV via television commercials yet preferred to obtain sexual health information from physicians. Hearing about HPV on a TV commercial was associated with increased knowledge. More knowledge of HPV was associated with less stigma. Men exhibit a higher level of stigma and less knowledge than women. Conclusions: Publicly funded health campaigns aimed at increasing knowledge about HPV are overdue and necessary. This is especially true for efforts targeting young adults about this extremely common sexually transmitted infection (STI).

TI Education, literacy, and health: Mediating effects on hypertension
   knowledge and control
SO PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING
LA English
DT Article
DE Health literacy; Education; Hypertension knowledge; Blood pressure

ID HEART-FAILURE; MORTALITY; DIFFERENTIALS; DISEASE; ADULTS
AB Objective: To determine whether literacy mediates the association between education, hypertension knowledge and control.
   Methods: In-person interviews with a literacy assessment and chart review were conducted with 330 hypertensive patients from six primary care safety net clinics. Mediational analysis was used to test the role of literacy skills in explaining the relationship between education and hypertension knowledge and control.
   Results: In multivariate analyses that did not make an adjustment for the other variable, both lower educational attainment and more limited literacy were found to be significant independent predictors of poorer hypertension knowledge and control. When literacy was entered into models that included education only, the association between education and knowledge was fully attenuated and no longer significant (Grades 1-8: beta = -0.30, 95% Cl = -1.44-0.83), while the relationship between education and blood pressure control was only minimally reduced (AOR 2.46, 95% Cl 2.10-2.88). More limited literacy skills also was associated with hypertension control in the final model (AOR 2.68, 95% Cl 1.54-4.70).
   Conclusion: Patient literacy mediated the relationship between education and hypertension knowledge. Literacy was a significant independent predictor of blood pressure control, but only minimally explained the relationship between education and blood pressure.
   Practice implications: Health literacy is critical to the design of educational tools to improve knowledge acquisition. However, in order to impact health outcome, future health literacy studies should also address other psychosocial factors that impact motivation and capability to manage disease.

AB Objective: Mental health problems often emerge in young adulthood. Although effective treatments are available, young adults are unlikely to seek professional help. This study examined barriers-to-care in young adults with serious internalizing or externalizing problems.
   Methods: Population-based study among 2258 19-32-year olds in the south-west region of the Netherlands. Barriers-to-care were examined in participants with serious internalizing or externalizing problems who did not seek professional help. A potential barrier was that participants denied that they had mental health problems. In those admitting problems, barriers were assessed with the Barriers-to-Care checklist and analyzed with Latent Class Analysis.
   Results: Of 362 participants with serious internalizing or externalizing problems 237 (65.5%) and not seek professional help. Of non-help-seeking young adults 36% denied having problems; additionally Latent Class Analysis revealed that 37% Perceived Problems as Self-Limitin (e.g., they believed that problems were not serious) and 24% Perceived Help-Seeking Negatively (e.g., they believed that treatment would not help).
   Conclusions: Young adults' barriers-to-care reflect limitations in their knowledge of mental health problems and available treatments, but possibly also a failure of existing mental health services to engage young people. More knowledge is urgently needed about the effectiveness of mental health treatments for young adults specifically.
   Practice implications: Treatment accessibility for Young adults may be augmented by improving their mental health literacy. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction Employment discrimination is considered as a major impediment to community integration for people with serious mental illness, yet little is known about how the problem manifests differently across western and non-western societies. We developed a lay model based on Chinese beliefs and values in terms of Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and folk religions which may be used to explain cross-cultural variation in mental illness stigma, particularly in the arena of employment discrimination. In this study, we tested this lay approach by comparing employers' concerns about hiring people with psychotic disorder for entry-level jobs in US and China. Method One hundred employers ( 40 from Chicago, 30 from Hong Kong, and 30 from Beijing) were randomly recruited from small size firms and interviewed by certified interviewers using a semi-structured interview guide designed for this study. Content analysis was used to derive themes, which in turn were compared across the three sites using chi-square tests. Results Analyses reveal that employers express a range of concerns about hiring an employee with mental illness. Although some concerns were raised with equal frequency across sites, comparisons showed that, relative to US employers, Chinese employers were significantly more likely to perceive that people with mental illness would exhibit a weaker work ethic and less loyalty to the company. Comparison of themes also suggests that employers in China were more people-oriented while employers in US were more task-oriented. Conclusion Cultural differences existed among employers which supported the lay theory of mental illness.

AB The aim of this study was to examine psychological and interpersonal risk factors for suicidal behavior in low income, African American women; 285 African American women who reported being in a relationship with a partner in the past year were studied, 148 presented to the hospital following a suicide attempt, and 137 presented for general medical cave. Cases were compared to controls with respect to psychological symptoms, alcohol and drug abuse, family violence (intimate partner abuse, childhood trauma), relationship discord, and serial support. Psychological risk factors for suicide attempts at the univariate level included psychological distress [Crude Odds Ratio (COR) = 6.5], post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (COR = 3.8), hopelessness (COR = 7.7), and drag abase (COR = 4.2). Interpersonal risk factors at the univariate level included relationship discord (COR = 4.0), physical partner abuse (COR = 2.5), nonphysical partner abuse (COR = 2.8), childhood maltreatment (COR = 3.2), and low levels of social support (COR = 2.6). A multivariate logistic regression model identified four variables that were strongly and independently associated with an increased risk for suicide attempts: psychological distress, hopelessness, drug abuse, and relationship discord. The model predicted suicide attempt status correctly 77% of the time. The results reveal that African American women who report high levels of psychological distress, hopelessness, drag use, and relationship discord should be assessed carefully for suicidal ideation and referred for appropriate mental health care.

AB Objectives: To review the evidence on the association between age and limited health literacy, overall and by health literacy test, and to investigate the mediating role of cognitive function.
   Method: The Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases were searched. Eligible studies were conducted in any country or language, included participants aged >= 50 years, presented a measure of association between age and health literacy, and were published through September 2013.
   Results: Seventy analyses in 60 studies were included in the systematic review; 29 of these were included in the meta-analysis. Older age was strongly associated with limited health literacy in analyses that measured health literacy as reading comprehension, reasoning, and numeracy skills (random-effects odds ratio [OR] = 4.20; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.13-5.64). By contrast, older age was weakly associated with limited health literacy in studies that measured health literacy as medical vocabulary (random-effects OR = 1.19; 95% CI: 1.03-1.37). Evidence on the mediating role of cognitive function was limited.
   Discussion: Health literacy tests that utilize a range of fluid cognitive abilities and mirror everyday health tasks frequently observe skill limitations among older adults. Vocabulary-based health literacy skills appear more stable with age. Researchers should select measurement tests wisely when assessing health literacy of older adults.

AB Objective: To review studies on the association between health literacy (HL), diabetes self-management and possible mediating variables.
   Methods: We systematically searched for empirical studies in PubMed. Findings were ordered by a HL framework that outlines routes between HL, sociocognitive determinants and health actions.
   Results: Of the 11 relevant studies, three reported a significant positive association between HL and specific diabetes self-management domains. Ten studies investigated the association between HL and knowledge (n = 8), beliefs (n = 2), self-efficacy (n = 3) and/or social support (n = 1). Significant associations were found between HL and knowledge (n = 6), self-efficacy (n = 1) and social support (n = 1). Of the three studies evaluating the effect of these sociocognitive variables on diabetes self-management, only one found proof for a mediating variable (social support) in the pathway between HL and self-management.
   Conclusion: There is only limited evidence for a significant association between HL and diabetes self-management, and for the mediating role of sociocognitive variables in this pathway.
   Practice implications: Longitudinal studies, including HL, diabetes self-management and potential mediators, are needed to substantiate possible associations between these variables. Such research is essential to enable evidence-based development of interventions to increase adequate and sustainable self-management in diabetic patients with low HL. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI Medication Adherence Behavior and Priorities Among Older Adults With
   CKD: A Semistructured Interview Study
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF KIDNEY DISEASES

AB Background: Older adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) typically use more than 5 medications and have multiple prescribing physicians. However, little is known about how they prioritize their medical conditions or decide which medications to take.
   Methods: Semistructured interviews (average length, 40 minutes) with 20 community-dwelling adults with CKD stages 3-5D receiving nephrology care at a tertiary referral center. Respondents were asked about medications, prescribing physicians, and medication-taking behaviors. We performed thematic analysis to explain patients' decisions regarding medication prioritization, understanding, and adherence decisions.
   Results: Participants (age range, 55-84 years; mean, 72 years) used 5-14 prescribed medications, had 2-9 physicians, and had 5-11 comorbid conditions. All had assigned implicit priorities to their medications. Although most expressed the intention to be adherent, many regularly skipped medications they considered less important. Most identified the prescribing physician and indication for each medication, but there often was substantial discordance between beliefs about medications and conventional medical opinion. Respondents prioritized medications based on the salience of the particular condition, perceived effects of the treatment, and barriers (physical, logistic, or financial) to using the prescribed drug. Side effects of medications were common and anxiety provoking, but discussions with the prescribing physician often were delayed or unfulfilling for the patient.
   Conclusions: Polypharmacy in patients with CKD leads to complex medication choices and adherence behaviors in this population. Most patients we interviewed had beliefs or priorities that were nonconcordant with conventional medical opinion; however, patients rarely discussed these beliefs and priorities or the resultant poor medication adherence with their physicians. Further study is needed to provide quantitative data about the magnitude of adherence barriers. It is likely that more effective communication about medication use could improve patients' health outcomes and reduce potential adverse drug events. Am J Kidney Dis 56: 439-446.

AB Objectives: To determine oral health literacy (REALD-30) and oral health literacy-related outcome associations, and to calculate if oral health literacy-related outcomes are risk indicators for poor self-reported oral health among rural-dwelling Indigenous Australians.
   Methods: 468 participants (aged 17-72 years, 63% female) completed a self-report questionnaire. REALD-30 and oral health literacy-related outcome associations were determined through bivariate analysis. Multivariate modelling was used to calculate risk indicators for poor self-reported oral health.
   Results: REALD-30 scores were lower among those who believed teeth should be infrequently brushed, believed cordial was good for teeth, did not own a toothbrush or owned a toothbrush but brushed irregularly. Tooth removal risk indicators included being older, problem-based dental attendance and believing cordial was good for teeth. Poor self-rated oral health risk indicators included being older, healthcare card ownership, difficulty paying dental bills, problem-based dental attendance, believing teeth should be brushed infrequently and irregular brushing. Perceived need for dental care risk indicators included being female and problem-based dental attendance. Perceived gum disease risk indicators included being older and irregular brushing. Feeling uncomfortable about oro-facial appearance risk indicators included problem-based dental attendance and irregular brushing. Food avoidance risk indicators were being female, difficulty paying dental bills, problem-based dental attendance and irregular brushing. Poor oral health-related quality of life risk indicators included difficulty paying dental bills and problem-based dental attendance.
   Conclusions: REALD-30 was significantly associated with oral health literacy-related outcomes. Oral health literacy-related outcomes were risk indicators for each of the poor self-reported oral health domains among this marginalised population.

TI Implementation strategies for health systems in low-income countries: an

DT Review
ID BEHAVIOR-CHANGE INTERVENTIONS; CONTINUING MEDICAL-EDUCATION;
   PATIENT-CARE; QUALITY; ADHERENCE; IMMUNIZATION; PROFESSIONS;
   IMPROVEMENT; PERFORMANCE; SIMULATION
AB Background
   A key function of health systems is implementing interventions to improve health, but coverage of essential health interventions remains low in low-income countries. Implementing interventions can be challenging, particularly if it entails complex changes in clinical routines; in collaborative patterns among different healthcare providers and disciplines; in the behaviour of providers, patients or other stakeholders; or in the organisation of care. Decision-makers may use a range of strategies to implement health interventions, and these choices should be based on evidence of the strategies' effectiveness.
   Objectives
   To provide an overview of the available evidence from up-to-date systematic reviews about the effects of implementation strategies for health systems in low-income countries. Secondary objectives include identifying needs and priorities for future evaluations and systematic reviews on alternative implementation strategies and informing refinements of the framework for implementation strategies presented in the overview.
   Methods
   We searched Health Systems Evidence in November 2010 and PDQ-Evidence up to December 2016 for systematic reviews. We did not apply any date, language or publication status limitations in the searches. We included well-conducted systematic reviews of studies that assessed the effects of implementation strategies on professional practice and patient outcomes and that were published after April 2005. We excluded reviews with limitations important enough to compromise the reliability of the review findings. Two overview authors independently screened reviews, extracted data and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. We prepared SUPPORT Summaries for eligible reviews, including key messages, 'Summary of findings' tables (using GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence) and assessments of the relevance of findings to low-income countries.
   Main results
   We identified 7272 systematic reviews and included 39 of them in this overview. An additional four reviews provided supplementary information. Of the 39 reviews, 32 had only minor limitations and 7 had important methodological limitations. Most studies in the reviews were from high-income countries. There were no studies from low-income countries in eight reviews.
   Implementation strategies addressed in the reviews were grouped into four categories - strategies targeting:
   1. healthcare organisations (e.g. strategies to change organisational culture; 1 review);
   2. healthcare workers by type of intervention (e.g. printed educational materials; 14 reviews);
   3. healthcare workers to address a specific problem (e.g. unnecessary antibiotic prescription; 9 reviews);
   4. healthcare recipients (e.g. medication adherence; 15 reviews).
   Overall, we found the following interventions to have desirable effects on at least one outcome with moderate-or high-certainty evidence and no moderate-or high-certainty evidence of undesirable effects.
   1. Strategies targeted at healthcare workers: educational meetings, nutrition training of health workers, educational outreach, practice facilitation, local opinion leaders, audit and feedback, and tailored interventions.
   2. Strategies targeted at healthcare workers for specific types of problems: training healthcare workers to be more patient-centred in clinical consultations, use of birth kits, strategies such as clinician education and patient education to reduce antibiotic prescribing in ambulatory care settings, and in-service neonatal emergency care training.
   3. Strategies targeted at healthcare recipients: mass media interventions to increase uptake of HIV testing; intensive self-management and adherence, intensive disease management programmes to improve health literacy; behavioural interventions and mobile phone text messages for adherence to antiretroviral therapy; a one time incentive to start or continue tuberculosis prophylaxis; default reminders for patients being treated for active tuberculosis; use of sectioned polythene bags for adherence to malaria medication; community-based health education, and reminders and recall strategies to increase vaccination uptake; interventions to increase uptake of cervical screening (invitations, education, counselling, access to health promotion nurse and intensive recruitment); health insurance information and application support.
   Authors' conclusions
   Reliable systematic reviews have evaluated a wide range of strategies for implementing evidence-based interventions in low-income countries. Most of the available evidence is focused on strategies targeted at healthcare workers and healthcare recipients and relates to process-based outcomes. Evidence of the effects of strategies targeting healthcare organisations is scarce.

AB Purpose: The success of national immunization programs depends on the public's confidence in vaccines. We sought to develop a scale for measuring confidence about adolescent vaccination in diverse populations of parents.
   Methods: Data came from 9623 parents who completed the 2010 National Immunization Survey-Teen, an annual, population-based telephone survey. Parents reported on a 13- to 17-year-old child in their households. We used exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis to identify latent constructs underlying parents' responses to 8 vaccination belief survey items (response scale 0-10) conceptualized using the Health Belief Model. We assessed the scale's psychometric properties overall and across demographic subgroups.
   Results: Parents' confidence about adolescent vaccination was generally high. Analyses provided support for three factors assessing benefits of vaccination (mean = 8.5), harms of vaccination (mean = 3.3), and trust in healthcare providers (mean = 9.0). The model showed good fit both overall (comparative fit index = 0.97) and across demographic subgroups, although internal consistency was variable for the three factors. We found lower confidence among several potentially vulnerable subpopulations, including mothers with lower levels of education and parents whose children were of Hispanic ethnicity (both p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Our brief, three-factor scale offers an efficient way to measure confidence in adolescent vaccination across demographic subgroups. Given evidence of lower confidence by educational attainment and race/ethnicity, program planners should consider factors such as health literacy and cultural competence when designing interventions to promote adolescent vaccination to ensure these programs are fully accessible.

AB Using a multidimensional assessment of health literacy (the Cancer Message Literacy Test-Listening, the Cancer Message Literacy Test-Reading, and the Lipkus Numeracy Scale), the authors assessed a stratified random sample of 1013 insured adults (40-70 years of age). The authors explored whether low health literacy across all 3 domains (n =111) was associated with sets of variables likely to affect engagement in cancer prevention and screening activities: (a) attitudes and behaviors relating to health care encounters and providers, (b) attitudes toward cancer and health, (c) knowledge of cancer screening tests, and (d) attitudes toward health related media and actual media use. Adults with low health literacy were more likely to report avoiding doctor's visits, to have more fatalistic attitudes toward cancer, to be less accurate in identifying the purpose of cancer screening tests, and more likely to avoid information about diseases they did not have. Compared with other participants, those with lower health literacy were more likely to say that they would seek information about cancer prevention or screening from a health care professional and less likely to turn to the Internet first for such information. Those with lower health literacy reported reading on fewer days and using the computer on fewer days than did other participants. The authors assessed the association of low health literacy with colorectal cancer screening in an age-appropriate subgroup for which colorectal cancer screening is recommended. In these insured subjects receiving care in integrated health care delivery systems, those with low health literacy were less likely to be up to date on screening for colorectal cancer, but the difference was not statistically significant.

AB Aims: To explore the impact of pictorial image and teach back educational strategies on knowledge, adherence to medication and diet among patients with type 2 diabetes and low health literacy in Saqqez, Iran.
   Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 127 patients with type 2 diabetes who had low health literacy were randomly allocated into three arms of the study (pictorial image, teach back, and control groups). The two intervention groups received education within three weekly sessions, each lasting 20 min. The level of functional health literacy in adults (TOFHLA), diabetes knowledge, and adherence to medication and diet were measured and compared in the three groups before and six weeks after the interventions. We used intention to treat analysis. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Paired t test.
   Results: Mean scores of knowledge, adherence to medication and diet revealed significant differences between two intervention groups and control group (P<0/001) six weeks after intervention.
   Conclusions: Both educational strategies increased knowledge, as well as adherence to medications and diet among patients with type 2 diabetes and low health literacy. Both educational strategies seem to be effective for patients with low health literacy and are recommended to be used according to patients' conditions. (C) 2012 Primary Care Diabetes Europe.

AB Background: Health and financial literacy have been linked to the health and well-being of older adults, yet there are few data on how health and financial literacy actually impact decision making regarding healthcare and economic choices in advanced age. Objective: To examine the association of health and financial literacy with decision making in older adults. Method: Data came from 525 community-dwelling older persons without dementia from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, an ongoing longitudinal study of aging. Health and financial literacy were assessed via a series of questions designed to measure comprehension of health and financial information and concepts. The two scores were averaged to yield a total literacy score. A modified, 12-item version of the Decision-Making Competence Assessment Tool was used to measure financial and healthcare decision making (6 items each), using materials designed to approximate those used in real world settings. All 12 items were summed to yield a total decision-making score. Associations were tested via linear regression models adjusted for age, sex and education. Secondary models adjusted for global cognitive function, income, depression and chronic medical conditions. Results: On average, participants correctly answered 67% of the literacy questions (health literacy = 61.6%, SD = 18.8% and financial literacy = 72.5%, SD = 16.0%). After adjustment for cognitive function, the total literacy score was positively associated with the decision-making total score (estimate = 0.64, SE = 0.08, p < 0.001), as well as healthcare (estimate = 0.37, SE = 0.5, p < 0.001) and financial decision making (estimate = 0.28, SE = 0.05, p < 0.001). Further, total literacy, health and financial literacy all were independently associated with decision making in models adjusted for covariates including income, depression, and chronic medical conditions (all p values < 0.001). Finally, there was evidence of effect modification such that the beneficial association between literacy and healthcare decision making was stronger among older persons, poorer persons and persons at the lower ranges of cognitive ability. Conclusion: Among community based older persons without dementia, higher levels of health and financial literacy were associated with better decision making, suggesting that improvements in literacy could facilitate better decision making and lead to better health and quality of life in later years.

AB It is likely that patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a limited understanding of their illness. Here we studied the relationships between objective and perceived knowledge in CKD using the Kidney Disease Knowledge Survey and the Perceived Kidney Disease Knowledge Survey. We quantified perceived and objective knowledge in 399 patients at all stages of non-dialysis-dependent CKD. Demographically, the patient median age was 58 years, 47% were women, 77% had stages 3-5 CKD, and 83% were Caucasians. The overall median score of the perceived knowledge survey was 2.56 (range: 1-4), and this new measure exhibited excellent reliability and construct validity. In unadjusted analysis, perceived knowledge was associated with patient characteristics defined a priori, including objective knowledge and patient satisfaction with physician communication. In adjusted analysis, older age, male gender, and limited health literacy were associated with lower perceived knowledge. Additional analysis revealed that perceived knowledge was associated with significantly higher odds (2.13), and objective knowledge with lower odds (0.91), of patient satisfaction with physician communication. Thus, our results present a mechanism to evaluate distinct forms of patient kidney knowledge and identify specific opportunities for education tailored to patients with CKD.

AB Purpose: As direct-to-consumer genetic testing becomes more available, a diverse group of consumers, including those with limited health literacy, may consider testing. In light of concerns raised about direct-to-consumer genetic testing, this study sought to critically examine whether the informational content, literacy demands, and usability of health-related direct-to-consumer websites met existing recommendations. Methods: A content analysis was performed on 29 health-related direct-to-consumer websites. Two coders independently evaluated each website for informational content (e.g., benefits, limitations), literacy demands (e.g., reading level), and usability (e. g., ease of navigation). Results: Most sites presented health conditions and some markers for which they tested, benefits of testing, a description of the testing process, and their privacy policy. Fewer cited scientific literature, explained test limitations, or provided an opportunity to consult a health professional. Key informational content was difficult to locate on most sites. Few sites gave sample disease risk estimates or used common language and explained technical terms consistently. Average reading level was grade 15. Conclusion: The quality of informational content, literacy demands, and usability across health-related direct-to-consumer websites varied widely. Many users would struggle to find and understand the important information. For consumers to better understand the content on these sites and evaluate the meaning of the tests for their health, sites should lower the demands placed on users by distilling and prioritizing the key informational content while simultaneously attending to the reading level and usability elements. In the absence of regulation compelling such changes, government agencies or professional organizations may need to increase consumer and provider awareness of these issues.

AB Objective: Patients are commonly presented with complex documents that they have difficulty understanding. The objective of this Study was to design and evaluate an animated computer agent to explain research consent forms to potential research participants.
   Methods: Subjects were invited to participate in a simulated consent process for a study involving a genetic repository. Explanation of the research consent form by the computer agent was compared to explanation by a human and a self-study condition in a randomized trial. Responses were compared according to level of health literacy.
   Results: Participants were most satisfied with the consent process and most likely to sign the consent form when it was explained by the computer agent, regardless of health literacy level. Participants with adequate health literacy demonstrated the highest level of comprehension with the computer agent-based explanation compared to the other two conditions. However, participants with limited health literacy showed poor comprehension levels in all three conditions. Participants with limited health literacy reported several reasons, such as lack of time constraints, ability to re-ask questions, and lack of bias, for preferring the computer agent-based explanation over a human-based one.
   Conclusion: Animated computer agents can perform as well as or better than humans in the administration of informed consent.
   Practice implications: Animated computer agents represent a viable method for explaining health documents to patients. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Self- reported medical history data are frequently used in epidemiological studies. Self- reported diagnoses may differ from medical record diagnoses due to poor patient- clinician communication, self- diagnosis in the absence of a satisfactory explanation for symptoms, or the " health literacy" of the patient.
   Methods: The US Department of Defense military health system offers a unique opportunity to evaluate electronic medical records with near complete ascertainment while on active duty. This study compared 38 self- reported medical conditions to electronic medical record data in a large population- based US military cohort. The objective of this study was to better understand challenges and strengths in self- reporting of medical conditions.
   Results: Using positive and negative agreement statistics for less- prevalent conditions, nearperfect negative agreement and moderate positive agreement were found for the 38 diagnoses.
   Conclusion: This report highlights the challenges of using self- reported medical data and electronic medical records data, but illustrates that agreement between the two data sources increases with increased surveillance period of medical records. Self- reported medical data may be sufficient for ruling out history of a particular condition whereas prevalence studies may be best served by using an objective measure of medical conditions found in electronic healthcare records. Defining medical conditions from multiple sources in large, long- term prospective cohorts will reinforce the value of the study, particularly during the initial years when prevalence for many conditions may still be low.

AB BACKGROUND. Ethnic and racial disparities in cancer outcomes are often attributed to sociodemographic factors, including income, education, insurance status, and access to quality cancer care. Less attention has been directed toward other possible contributors, such as misconceptions about cancer and its treatment.
   METHODS. Nine hundred fifty-seven U.S. adults who reported that they had never been diagnosed with cancer were identified and surveyed using a random digit dialing telephone survey. Sociodemographic associations with endorsement of five misconceptions about cancer treatment were evaluated by weighted logistic regression.
   RESULTS. The most prevalent misconception, "Treating cancer with surgery can cause it to spread throughout the body," was endorsed as true by 41% of the respondents. The second most prevalent misconception, "The medical industry is withholding a cure for cancer from the public in order to increase profits, " was identified as true by 27%. The statement, "Pain medications are ineffective against cancer pain, " was accurately rejected by 68% of the respondents, and 89% of the respondents correctly disagreed with the statement, "All you need to beat cancer is a positive attitude, not treatment. " Eighty-seven percent of the respondents were able to identify the statement, "Cancer is something that cannot be effectively treated," as false. Respondents who were older, nonwhite, Southern, or indicated being less informed about cancer endorsed the most misconceptions.
   CONCLUSIONS. The prevalence of at least three of the five cancer misconceptions was unacceptably high, and varied by several sociodemographic factors. These beliefs may increase the risk for cancer morbidity and mortality because of poor adherence to treatment regimens. Cancer 2005;104:653-60. (c) 2005 American Cancer Society.

AB This article reviews current literature and research on literacy and health and identifies priorities for research on this topic in Canada. Information sources included documents found through an environmental scan, the Alpha Plus collection and a computer search of recent documents. The information was analyzed using a conceptual framework. The review found that low literacy has direct and indirect impacts on health. Families are at risk due to difficulty reading medication prescriptions, baby formula instructions and health and safety education materials. People with lower levels of literacy tend to live and work in less healthy environments. They have more difficulties obtaining employment and income security. Determinants of literacy include: education, early childhood development, aging, living and working conditions, personal capacity/genetics, gender and culture. Action is needed to improve literacy and health through a combination of health communication, education and training, community development, organizational development, and policy development. There is some evidence that such interventions can have a positive effect on health, particularly when combined with one another. Further program and policy development requires greater evidence and evaluation of existing initiatives, more cost/benefit analyses, more culturally specific studies, and greater attention to current social trends and needs.

AB PURPOSE he purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between race/ethnicity and self-management practices of people with diabetes.
   METHODS Analyses were based on data from the 2001 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Contingency tables and multiple logistic regression were used to assess the data.
   RESULTS Frequency distributions of selected diabetes management variables significantly varied across levels of race/ethnicity. These differences persisted after adjusting for current age, age at diagnosis, gender, marital status, income, and education. Analyses revealed that Hispanics, compared with whites, were more likely to take oral agents to control their blood glucose, less likely to monitor their blood glucose daily, and less likely to check their feet for sores or irritation. There was no difference among the racial/ethnic groups use having participated in a diabetes education class.
   CONCLUSIONS Health literacy and cultural factors, including the influence of family, beliefs about diabetes, and access and utilization of health care, may influence Hispanic diabetes management behaviors. Understanding these influences is essential to the development of programs, policies, and other strategies that are culturally appropriate and relevant.

AB Adaptation to living with cardiovascular disease may differ from patient to patient and is influenced not only by disease severity and limitations incurred by the disease but also by socioeconomic factors (e.g. health literacy), the patients' psychological make-up and susceptibility to distress. Co-morbid depression and/or anxiety is prevalent in 20% of patients with cardiovascular disease, which may be either transient or chronic. Distress, such as depression, reduces adherence, serves as a barrier to behaviour change and the adoption of a healthy lifestyle, and increases the risk that patients drop out of cardiac rehabilitation, impacting on patients' quality of life, risk of hospitalisation and mortality. Hence it is paramount to identify this subset of high-risk patients in clinical practice. This review provides a general overview of the prevalence of selected psychosocial risk factors, their impact on patient-reported and clinical outcomes, and biological and behavioural mechanisms that may explain the association between psychosocial factors and health outcomes. The review also provides recommendations on which self-report screening measures to use to identify patients at high risk due to their psychosocial profile, and the effectiveness of available trials that target these risk factors. Despite challenges and barriers associated with screening of patients combined with appropriate treatment, it is paramount that we treat not only the heart but also the mind in order to improve the quality of care and patient and clinical outcomes.

AB Background Lower health literacy is a public health issue that follows a social gradient, potentially reinforcing existing health inequalities. However, levels of health literacy in particular populations can be unclear and are a key to identifying effective public health interventions. This research examined health literacy levels in Stoke-on-Trent, where 31.2% of the population live in areas classified amongst the 10% most deprived in England.
   Methods A cross-sectional survey using the Newest Vital Sign examined associations with demographic factors, lifestyle behaviours, Internet use and self-rated health. The sample (n = 1046) took account of variance in levels of health literacy by age, educational attainment and deprivation. Bivariate logistic regression and multi-variate logistic regression were used to estimate associations with health literacy when adjusted for other demographic factors and lifestyle behaviours.
   Results Nine hundred and seventy-two respondents completed the health literacy measure (93%): 277 (28.5%) scored low, 228 (23.5%) scored marginal and 467 (48.0%) scored adequate. Associations with higher rates of limited health literacy included older age, lower educational level, lower income, perceived poor health and lack of access to the Internet.
   Conclusions Given the complexity of factors influencing health literacy interdisciplinary approaches across health and social care and the voluntary sector are essential in identifying and developing appropriate interventions.

AB Objective: This study evaluated the effectiveness of a school-based mental health literacy intervention for adolescents on knowledge and stigma.
   Method: A total of 24 high schools and 534 students in the regional area of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada participated in this randomized controlled trial. Schools were randomly assigned to either the curriculum or control condition. The curriculum was integrated into the province's grade 11 and 12 "Healthy Living" courses and was delivered by teachers. Changes in mental health knowledge and stigma were measured using pre- and posttest questionnaires. Descriptive analyses were conducted to provide sample characteristics, and multilevel modeling was used to examine study outcomes.
   Results: For the curriculum condition, there was a significant change in stigma scores over time (p=.001), with positive attitudes toward mental illness increasing from pre to post. There was also a significant change in knowledge scores over time (p<.001), with knowledge scores increasing from pre to post. No significant changes in knowledge or stigma were found for participants in the control condition. A meaningful relationship was found whereby increases in knowledge significantly predicted increases in positive attitudes toward mental health (p<.001).
   Conclusion: This is the first large randomized controlled trial to demonstrate the effectiveness in mental health literacy of an integrated, manualized mental health educational resource for high school students on knowledge and stigma. Findings also support the applicability by teachers and suggest the potential for broad-based implementation of the educational curriculum in high schools. Replication and further studies are warranted.

AB Purpose: The National Institutes of Health, American Medical Association, and United States Department of Health and Human Services recommend that patient education materials be written at a fourth to sixth grade reading level to facilitate comprehension. We examined and compared the readability and difficulty of online patient education materials from the American Urological Association and academic urology departments in the Northeastern United States.
   Materials and Methods: We assessed the online patient education materials for difficulty level with 10 commonly used readability assessment tools, including the Flesch Reading Ease Score, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Simple Measure of Gobbledygook, Gunning Frequency of Gobbledygook, New Dale-Chall Test, Coleman-Liau index, New Fog Count, Raygor Readability Estimate, FORCAST test and Fry score.
   Results: Most patient education materials on the websites of these programs were written at or above the eleventh grade reading level.
   Conclusions: Urological online patient education materials are written above the recommended reading level. They may need to be simplified to facilitate better patient understanding of urological topics.

AB Objective. Various otolaryngology associations provide Internet-based patient education material (IPEM) to the general public. However, this information may be written above the fourth- to sixth-grade reading level recommended by the American Medical Association (AMA) and National Institutes of Health (NIH). The purpose of this study was to assess the readability of otolaryngology-related IPEMs on various otolaryngology association websites and to determine whether they are above the recommended reading level for patient education materials.
   Study Design and Setting. Analysis of patient education materials from 9 major otolaryngology association websites.
   Methods. The readability of 262 otolaryngology-related IPEMs was assessed with 8 numerical and 2 graphical readability tools. Averages were evaluated against national recommendations and between each source using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) analysis. Mean readability scores for each otolaryngology association website were compared.
   Results. Mean website readability scores using Flesch Reading Ease test, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Coleman-Liau Index, SMOG grading, Gunning Fog Index, New Dale-Chall Readability Formula, FORCAST Formula, New Fog Count Test, Raygor Readability Estimate, and the Fry Readability Graph ranged from 20.0 to 57.8, 9.7 to 17.1, 10.7 to 15.9, 11.6 to 18.2, 10.9 to 15.0, 8.6 to 16.0, 10.4 to 12.1, 8.5 to 11.8, 10.5 to 17.0, and 10.0 to 17.0, respectively. ANOVA results indicate a significant difference (P < .05) between the websites for each individual assessment.
   Conclusion. The IPEMs found on all otolaryngology association websites exceed the recommended fourth- to sixth-grade reading level.

AB In the United States, racial-ethnic minorities experience disproportionately high rates of ESRD, but they are substantially less likely to receive living donor kidney transplants (LDKT) compared with their majority counterparts. Minorities may encounter barriers to LDKT at several steps along the path to receiving it, including consideration, pursuit, completion of LDKT, and the post-LDKT experience. These barriers operate at different levels related to potential recipients and donors, health care providers, health system structures, and communities. In this review, we present a conceptual framework describing various barriers that minorities face along the path to receiving LDKT. We also highlight promising recent and current initiatives to address these barriers, as well as gaps in initiatives, which may guide future interventions to reduce racial-ethnic disparities in LDKT.

AB Background: Unmet needs for mental health treatment in low income countries are pervasive. If mental health is to be effectively integrated into primary health care in low income countries like India then grass-roots workers need to acquire relevant knowledge and skills to be able to recognise, refer and support people experiencing mental disorders in their own communities. This study aims to provide a mental health training intervention to community health workers in Bangalore Rural District, Karnataka, India, and to evaluate the impact of this training on mental health literacy.
   Methods: A pre-test post-test study design was undertaken with assessment of mental health literacy at three time points; baseline, completion of the training, and three month follow-up. Mental health literacy was assessed using the interviewer-administered Mental Health Literacy Survey. The training intervention was a four day course based on a facilitator's manual developed specifically for community health workers in India.
   Results: 70 community health workers from Doddaballapur, Bangalore Rural District were recuited for the study. The training course improved participants' ability to recognize a mental disorder in a vignette, and reduced participants' faith in unhelpful and potentially harmful pharmacological interventions. There was evidence of a minor reduction in stigmatizing attitudes, and it was unclear if the training resulted in a change in participants' faith in recovery following treatment.
   Conclusion: The findings from this study indicate that the training course demonstrated potential to be an effective way to improve some aspects of mental health literacy, and highlights strategies for strengthening the training course.

AB Purpose of review
   Against the backdrop of a large burden and treatment gap for mental disorders in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), recently published articles were reviewed to assess strategies and actions for optimizing mental health services in LMICs.
   Recent findings
   Key strategies and actions are as follows: (i) the adoption of a decentralized stepped care approach embracing task shifting to nonspecialists for those disorders for which it has been shown to be effective; (ii) ensuring adequate numbers of mental health specialists to provide a supportive supervisory framework and referral pathways; (iii) ensuring adequate infrastructure to support decentralized care; (iv) promoting mental health literacy; (v) adoption of a social inclusion and developmental model of disability in caring for people with chronic mental illness; and (vi) embracing a multisectoral community collaborative approach.
   Summary
   Optimizing mental health services in LMICs requires legislation, policies and plans that are enabling of the above strategies and actions. Studies demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of integrated stepped packages of care embracing a task-shifting approach, and best practices for strengthening mental health literacy and collaborative arrangements with community caregivers and other sectors, can assist this process. Specialist mental health training programmes in LMICs also need to be responsive to the changing demands on service providers, incorporating a public health approach and equipping specialists for diversification of their roles within the task shifting model.

AB Objective: We examined the effects of presentation medium on immediate and delayed recall of information and assessed the effect of giving patients take-home materials after initial presentations.
   Methods: Primary-care patients received video-based, print-based or no asthma education about asthma symptoms and triggers and then answered knowledge-based questions. Print participants and half the video participants received take-home print materials. A week later, available participants completed the knowledge assessment again.
   Results: Participants receiving either intervention outperformed controls on immediate and delayed assessments (p < 0.001). For symptom-related information, immediate performance did not significantly differ between print and video participants. A week later, receiving take-home print predicted better performance (p < 0.05), as did self-reported review among recipients of take-home print (p < 0.01). For content about inhaler usage, although video watchers outperformed print participants immediately after seeing the materials (p < 0.001), a week later these two groups' performance did not significantly differ. Among participants given take-home materials, review predicted marginally better recall (p = 0.06).
   Conclusion: Video and print interventions can promote recall of health-related information. Additionally, reviewable materials, if they are utilized, may improve retention. Practice implications: When creating educational tools, providers should consider how long information must be retained, its content, and the feasibility of providing tangible supporting materials.

TI Barriers and Facilitators to Shared Decision-making Among
   African-Americans with Diabetes

ID PATIENT; COMMUNICATION; ENCOUNTER; QUALITY; CARE
AB INTRODUCTION: Shared decision-making (SDM) between patients and their physicians is associated with improved diabetes health outcomes. African-Americans have less SDM than Whites, which may contribute to diabetes racial disparities. To date, there has been little research on SDM among African-Americans.
   OBJECTIVE: We explored the barriers and facilitators to SDM among African-Americans with diabetes.
   METHODS: Qualitative research design with a phenomenological methodology using in-depth interviews (n=24) and five focus groups (n=27). Each interview/focus group was audio-taped and transcribed verbatim, and coding was conducted using an iterative process. Participants: We utilized a purposeful sample of African-American adult patients with diabetes. All patients had insurance and received their care at an academic medical center.
   RESULTS: Patients identified multiple SDM barriers/facilitators, including the patient/provider power imbalance that was perceived to be exacerbated by race. Patient-related factors included health literacy, fear/denial, family experiences and self-efficacy. Reported physician-related barriers/facilitators include patient education, validating patient experiences, medical knowledge, accessibility and availability, and interpersonal skills.
   DISCUSSION: Barriers/facilitators of SDM exist among African-Americans with diabetes, which can be effectively addressed in the outpatient setting. Primary care physicians, particularly academic internists, may be uniquely situated to address these barriers/facilitators and train future physicians to do so as well.

TI Diabetes Numeracy An overlooked factor in understanding racial
   disparities in glycemic control
SO DIABETES CARE
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH LITERACY; ASSOCIATION; SKILLS; CARE
AB OBJECTIVE - Understanding the reasons and eliminating the pervasive health disparities in diabetes is a major research, clinical, and health policy goal, We examined whether health literacy, general numeracy, and diabetes-related numeracy explain the association between African American race and poor glycemic control (A1C) in patients with diabetes.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Adults with type 2 diabetes (n = 383) were enrolled in a cross-sectional study at primary care and diabetes clinics at three medical centers. Data collected included the following: self-reported race, health literacy, general numeracy, diabetes-related numeracy, A1C, and sociodemographic factors. A series of Structural equation models were estimated to explore the interrelations between variables and test for mediation.
   RESULTS - in model 1, younger age (r = -0.21, P < 0.001), insulin use (r = 0.27, P < 0.001), greater years with diabetes (r = 0.16, P < 0.01), and African American race (r = 0.12, P < 0.01) were all associated with poorer glycemic control. In model 2, diabetes-related numeracy emerged as a strong predictor of A1C (r = -0.46, P < 0.001), reducing the association between African American and poor glycemic control to nonsignificance (r = 0.10, NS). In model 3, African American race and older age were associated with lower diabetes-related numeracy; younger age, insulin use, more years with diabetes, and lower diabetes-related numeracy were associated with poor glycemic control.
   CONCLUSIONS - Diabetes-related numeracy reduced the explanatory power of African American race, such that low diabetes-related numeracy, not African American race, was significantly related to poor glycemic control. Interventions that address numeracy could help to reduce racial disparities in diabetes.

AB Objective: To evaluate the published literature on the effects of complex (multi-faceted) interventions intended to improve the health-related outcomes of individuals with limited literacy or numeracy.
   Methods: We undertook a systematic review of randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials with a narrative synthesis. The search strategy included searching eight databases from start date to 2007, reference checking and contacting expert informants. After the initial screen, two reviewers independently assessed eligibility, extracted data and evaluated study quality.
   Results: The searches yielded 2734 non-duplicate items, which were reduced to 15 trials. Two interventions were directed at health professionals, one intervention was literacy education, and 12 were health education/management interventions. The quality of the trials was mixed, 13/15 trials were conducted in North America, and all focused on literacy rather than numeracy. 13/15 trials reported at least one significant difference in primary outcome, all favoring the intervention group. Only 8/15 trials measured direct clinical outcomes. Knowledge and self-efficacy were the class of outcome most likely to improve.
   Conclusion: A wide variety of complex interventions for adults with limited literacy are able to improve some health-related outcomes.
   Practice implications: This review supports the wider introduction of interventions for people with limited literacy, particularly within an evaluation context. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Many deaf individuals are at increased risk for fund-of-information deficits, including deficits in health-related information. Research on health information knowledge, an aspect of health literacy, demonstrates an association between low health literacy and health disparities in many populations. Deaf individuals are at particular risk for low health literacy, but no research has been conducted on this topic. Objective: To investigate health-related vocabulary knowledge in a sample of deaf adults. Measure: A task based on the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM). Participants: Fifty-seven deaf adults reported whether they did or did not comprehend 66 health-related terms from the REALM. Of the participants, 81% possessed a college degree. Results: Thirty-two percent of the deaf participants earned scores on the modified REALM task comparable to REALM scores considered indicative of low health literacy. The pattern of words that were least commonly and most commonly understood differed from normative expectations of hearing REALM respondents. Conclusions: This highly educated deaf participant sample demonstrated risk for low health literacy. The general deaf population is likely at even higher risk for health problems associated with low health literacy.

AB Background: Few studies have examined the influence of physician workplace conditions on health care disparities. We compared 96 primary care clinics in New York, New York, and in the upper Midwest serving various proportions of minority patients to determine differences in workplace organizational characteristics.
   Methods: Cross-sectional data are from surveys of 96 clinic managers, 388 primary care physicians, and 1701 of their adult patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or congestive heart failure participating in the Minimizing Error, Maximizing Outcome (MEMO) study. Data from 27 clinics with at least 30% minority patients were contrasted with data from 69 clinics with less than 30% minority patients.
   Results: Compared with clinics serving less than 30% minority patients, clinics serving at least 30% minority patients have less access to medical supplies (2.7 vs 3.4, P < .001), referral specialists (3.0 vs 3.5, P < .005) on a scale of 1 (none) to 4 (great), and examination rooms per physician (2.2 vs 2.7, P = .002). Their patients are more frequently depressed (22.8% vs 12.1%), are more often covered by Medicaid (30.2% vs 11.4%), and report lower health literacy (3.7 vs 4.4) on a scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high) (P < .001 for all). Physicians from clinics serving higher proportions of minority populations perceive their patients as frequently speaking little or no English (27.1% vs 3.4%, P = .004), having more chronic pain (24.1% vs 12.9%, P < .001) and substance abuse problems (15.1% vs 10.1%, P = .005), and being more medically complex (53.1% vs 39.9%) and psychosocially complex (44.9% vs 28.2%) (P < .001 for both). In regression analyses, clinics with at least 30% minority patients are more likely to have chaotic work environments (odds ratio, 4.0; P = .003) and to have fewer physicians reporting high work control (0.2; P = .003) or high job satisfaction (0.4; P = .01).
   Conclusion: Clinics serving higher proportions of minority patients have more challenging workplace and organizational characteristics.

AB Health literacy deficits affect half the American patient population and are linked to poor health, ineffective disease management and high rates of hospitalization. Restricted literacy has also been linked with less satisfying medical visits and communication difficulties, particularly in terms of the interpersonal and informational aspects of care. Despite growing attention to these issues by researchers and policy makers, few studies have attempted to conceptualize and assess those aspects of dialogue that challenge persons with low literacy skills, i.e., the oral literacy demand within medical encounters.
   The current study uses videotapes and transcripts of 152 prenatal and cancer pretest genetic counseling sessions recorded with simulated clients to develop a conceptual framework to explore oral literacy demand and its consequences for medical interaction and related outcomes. Ninety-six prenatal and 81 cancer genetic counselors broadly representative of the US National Society of Genetic Counselors-participated in the study. Key elements of the conceptual framework used to define oral literacy demand include: (1) use of unfamiliar technical terms; (2) general language complexity, reflected in the application of Microsoft Word grammar summary statistics to session transcripts; and, (3) structural characteristics of dialogue, including pacing, density, and interactivity. Genetic counselor outcomes include self-ratings of session satisfaction, informativeness, and development of rapport. The simulated clients rated their satisfaction with session communication, the counselor's effective use of nonverbal skills, and the counselor's affective demeanor during the session.
   Sessions with greater overall technical term use were longer and used more complex language reflected in readability indices and multi-syllabic vocabulary (measures averaging p<.05). Sessions with a high proportionate use of technical terms were characterized by shorter visits, high readability demand, slow speech speed, fewer and more dense counselor speaking turns and low interactivity (p<.05). The higher the use of technical terms, and the more dense and less interactive the dialogue, the less satisfied the simulated clients were and the lower their ratings were of counselors' nonverbal effectiveness and affective demeanor (all relationships p<.05). Counselors' self-ratings of informativeness were also inversely related to use of technical terms (p<.05).
   Just as print material can be made more reader-friendly and effective following established guidelines, the medical dialoaue may also be made more patient-centered and meaningful by having providers monitor their vocabulary and language, as well as the structural characteristics of interaction, thereby lowering the literacy demand of routine medical dialogue. These consequences are important for all patients but may be even more so for patients with restricted literacy. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Development and pilot testing of a disease management program for low literacy patients with heart failure. Background: Randomized trials have shown that disease management programs can reduce hospitalizations and improve symptoms for patients with congestive heart failure. We sought to create and pilot test such a program for patients with low literacy skills. Methods: We used focus groups and individual cognitive response interviews (CRIs) to develop an educational booklet for low literacy patients with heart failure. We incorporated the booklet into a disease management intervention that also included an initial individualized 1-h educational session and scheduled supportive phone calls that were tapered over 6 weeks.
   We then conducted a 3-month before-after study on patients with low literacy skills (<9th grade literacy level) in a university internal medicine clinic to test the acceptability and efficacy of our program. Outcomes of interest included heart failure-related knowledge, self-care behavior and heart failure-related symptoms measured on the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLwHF) scale. Results: Twenty-five patients were enrolled and 23 (92%) completed 3-month follow-up. Mean age was 60 years (range 35-74), 60% were men, 60% were African-American, and 74% had household income under $15,000 per year. The median reading level was fifth grade with 32% reading at or below the third grade level. Mean knowledge score at baseline was 67% and did not improve after the intervention. The proportion of patients reporting weighing themselves daily increased from 32% at baseline to 100% at 12 weeks. Mean improvement on the MLwHF scale was 9.9 points over the 3-month trial (95% CI: 0.5, 19.2), which corresponds to an improvement in one class on the New York Heart Association heart failure scale. Conclusion: A heart failure disease management program designed specifically for patients with low literacy skills is acceptable and is associated with improvement in self-care behavior and heart failure related symptoms.

ID MENTAL-HEALTH LITERACY; DISORDERS; DIAGNOSIS; BELIEFS
AB Objectives: To describe the experiences of people whose lives have been affected by depression.
   Design, setting and participants: Thematic review of data collected from 21 community meetings (1529 people, providing 911 evaluation forms) and nine focus groups (69 individuals) held nationally, and written feedback and website-based interactions with beyondblue: the national depression initiative between April and December 2001.
   Main outcome measures: Barriers to social participation experienced by people whose lives have been affected by depression, and their interactions with the healthcare system.
   Results: The key theme was the experience of stigma, which was evident in healthcare settings and in barriers to social participation, particularly regarding employment. Inadequacies of primary care and specialist treatment systems were highlighted. Particular emphasis was placed on limited access to high-quality primary care and nonpharmacological care. The stigmatising attitudes of many healthcare providers were notable. Within society, lack of access to knowledge and self-care or mutual support services was evident. Lack of support both from and for people in caring roles was also emphasised.
   Conclusions: People with depression are subject to many of the same attitudes, inadequate healthcare and social barriers reported by people with psychotic disorders. Consumers and carers prioritise certain notions of illness, recovery and quality of healthcare, and expect healthcare providers to respond to these concerns.

AB Rationale: Donation after circulatory determination of death ( DCDD) has the potential to increase the number of organs available for transplantation. Because consent and management of potential donors must occur before death, DCDD raises unique ethical and policy issues. Objectives: To develop an ethics and health policy statement on adult and pediatric DCDD relevant to critical care and transplantation stakeholders.
   Methods: A multidisciplinary panel of stakeholders was convened to develop an ethics and health policy statement. The panel consisted of representatives from the American Thoracic Society, Society of Critical Care Medicine, International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, and the United Network of Organ Sharing. The panel reviewed the literature, discussed important ethics and health policy considerations, and developed a guiding framework for decision making by stakeholders.
   Results: A framework to guide ethics and health policy statement was established, which addressed the consent process, pre- and post mortem interventions, the determination of death, provisions of end-of-life care, and pediatric DCDD.
   Conclusions: The information presented in this Statement is based on the current evidence, experience, and clinical rationale. New clinical research and the development and dissemination of new technologies will eventually necessitate an update of this Statement.

AB Inadequate health literacy may impair research subjects' ability to participate adequately in the informed consent (IC) process. Our aim is to evaluate the evidence supporting interventions, to improve comprehension of the IC process in low literacy subjects.
   We performed a MEDLINE database search (1966 to November 2011) supplemented by manual searches of bibliographies of key relevant articles. We selected all studies in which a modification of the IC was tested to improve comprehension in low literacy populations. Study design, quality criteria, population, interventions and outcomes for each trial were extracted. The main outcome evaluated was comprehension, measured using a written test or verbal comprehension.
   Our search strategy yielded 281 studies, of which only six met our eligibility criteria. The six studies included 1620 research participants. The studies predominantly included populations that were older (median age 61, range 48-64), ethnic minority, and with literacy level of 8th grade or below. Only one study had a randomized design. The specific intervention differed in each study. Two of the studies included the teach-back method or teach to goal method and achieved the highest level of comprehension. Two studies changed the readability level of the IC and resulted in the lowest comprehension among study subjects.
   The evidence supporting interventions to improve the informed consent process in low literacy populations is extremely limited. Among the interventions evaluated, having a study team member spend more time talking one-on-one to study participants was the most effective strategy for improving informed consent understanding; however, this finding is based on the results of a single study.

AB Low health literacy is a common and serious issue in U.S. health care. Health care professionals lack adequate training in health literacy principles. Increasing and improving health literacy training for the health care workforce is needed. Health professions educators have responded to this need by developing health literacy curricula, which use a wide variety of didactic and experiential teaching techniques and tools. This article reviews the literature on teaching health literacy principles to health professionals and presents a menu of teaching options for health professions educators.

AB Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of standardized, patient-centered label (PCL) instructions to improve comprehension of prescription drug use compared with typical instructions.
   Methods: A total of 500 adult patients recruited from 2 academic and 2 community primary care clinics in Chicago, IL and Shreveport, LA were assigned to receive as follows: (1) standard prescription instructions written as times per day (once, twice 3 times per day) (usual care), (2) PCL instructions that specify explicit timing with standard intervals (morning, noon, evening, bedtime) (PCL), or (3) PCL instructions with a graphic aid to visually depict dose and timing of the medication (PCL + Graphic). The outcome was correct interpretation of label instructions.
   Results: Instructions with the PCL format were more likely to be correctly interpreted compared with standard instructions (adjusted relative risk [RR] : 1.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] : 1.25-1.41). Inclusion of the graphic aid (PCL + Graphic) decreased rates of correct interpretation compared with PCL instructions alone (RR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.89-0.97). Patients with low literacy were better able to interpret PCL instructions (low literacy: RR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.14 -1.68; P = 0.001).
   Conclusion: The PCL approach could improve patients' understanding and use of their medication regimen.

TI Measuring conceptual health knowledge in the context of oral health

SO JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH DENTISTRY

AB Objectives:
   Health literacy encompasses several abilities including word recognition, reading comprehension, communication skills, and conceptual knowledge. To date, conceptual knowledge has not been included in oral health literacy research. This study assesses the validity and reliability of a new instrument and describes conceptual oral health knowledge among a sample of low-income adults.
   Methods:
   One hundred Baltimore adults were administered the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM), Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (Short-TOFHLA), and a new survey of conceptual oral health knowledge. Respondents were also asked about sociodemographics, dental health, and utilization.
   Results:
   Psychometric analysis was used to identify a subset of oral health knowledge questions from the new survey instrument. The resulting Comprehensive Measure of Oral Health Knowledge (CMOHK) was categorized into three levels of knowledge (poor, fair, good). Nearly one-third of Baltimore adults exhibited the lowest level. CMOHK scores were significantly associated with age, education level, and word recognition (REALM). CMOHK scores were not associated with reading comprehension (Short-TOFHLA) or dental care visits. Instrument reliability was good (Cronbach alpha = 0.74).
   Conclusions:
   This preliminary study yielded a new measure of oral health conceptual knowledge, available for use in future oral health literacy studies. The author presents a conceptual framework of oral health literacy that separates health literacy into four unique components and places decision-making at the center. Future studies are needed to determine whether this framework is supported by empirical data and leads to improvements in oral health and reductions in health disparities.

AB This review of adult public understandings of genetics related to health indicates that the public's understandings overlap with those of professionals in some areas, but not others. Specifically, the majority of the world's people who have been studied understand genetics through the lens of heredity, not in terms of the structural and functional nature of genes. Public understandings of hereditary processes are influenced by models of social relationships and by experiential familiarity with particular conditions as much as by academic research results. Most people hold a fairly strong belief that many health conditions are substantially influenced by both genes and other factors. However, they do not have a stable understanding of the nature of gene-environment interactions. People in cultures where science is not a prominent cultural mode are even less likely to hold the belief structures of professional geneticists. In some areas-notably with regard to racialization of genetic medicine and characterizations of genetic variations as 'mutations'-at least some members of the public strongly reject some geneticists' constructions. Public understanding of details pertinent to genetic testing generally appears to be weak.

AB There have been major advances in techniques to increase patient involvement in health decisions with the benefits of greater involvement and shared decision making now widely recognized. However, there has been little attention in the development of tools and strategies to support patient participation among adults with lower literacy, a group with poor health knowledge, limited involvement in health decisions, and poor health outcomes. The authors put forward a framework to consider the different stages of shared health decision making and the tasks and skills required to achieve each stage. They consider where current research exists in the decision making literature and where more is needed if adults with limited literacy are to be better engaged in shared decision making in health care.

TI The METER: A Brief, Self-Administered Measure of Health Literacy
SO JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE health literacy; METER; REALM; cardiovascular health
AB Given rapidly accumulating evidence that health literacy is correlated with important health-related measures, assessing patients' health literacy level is of increasing concern for researchers and practitioners. Practical limitations for use of existing health literacy measures include length of time and practitioner involvement in administration.
   To develop and validate a brief, self-administered measure of health literacy, the Medical Term Recognition Test (METER).
   155 participants were recruited from an outpatient cardiology program at an urban hospital.
   Patients completed measures of health literacy (METER and REALM), neuropsychological function, psychosocial health, and self-report questionnaires about health behaviors. Indicators of cardiovascular health were also recorded from patients' medical charts.
   The measure took 2 min to complete. The internal consistency of the METER was 0.93, and it correlated highly with REALM (r = 0.74). Regarding sensitivity and specificity for identifying individuals below REALM's cutoff for functional literacy, METER resulted in 75% correct identifications and 8% false positives. METER and REALM were both associated with various health-related measures (including significant correlations with measures of neuropsychological function and cardiovascular health).
   These initial findings show that the METER is a quick and practical measure of health literacy for use in clinical settings.

AB OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to identify potential explanatory factors for racial differences in blood pressure (BP) control.
   DESIGN: The design of the study was a cross-sectional study
   PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: The study included 608 patients with hypertension who were either African American (50%) or white (50%) and who received primary care in Durham, NC.
   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Baseline data were obtained from the Take Control of Your Blood pressure study and included clinical, demographic, and psychosocial variables potentially related to clinic BP measures. African Americans were more likely than whites to have inadequate baseline clinic BP control as defined as greater than or equal to 140/90 mmHg (49% versus 34%; unadjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-2.5). Among factors that may explain this disparity, being older, reporting hypertension medication nonadherence, reporting a hypertension diagnosis for more than 5 years, reporting high levels of stress, being worried about hypertension, and reporting an increased number of medication side effects were related to inadequate BP control. In adjusted analyses, African Americans continue to have poor BP control relative to whites; the magnitude of the association was reduced (OR=1.5; 95% CI 1.0-2.1). Medication nonadherence, worries about hypertension, and older age (> 70) continued to be related to poor BP control.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of hypertensive patients, there were a number of factors associated with poor BP control that partially explained the observed racial disparity in hypertension control including age, medication nonadherence, and worry about BP. Medication nonadherence is of particular interest because it is a potentially modifiable factor that might be used to reduce the racial disparity in BP control.

AB Internet health information is rated highly by users and is used to compensate for gaps in health information provided by health professionals. Greater understanding of health issues and changes to personal health management has been reported as a consequence of Internet use. However, there are significant disparities in the access and use of Internet health information linked to income, education and ethnicity. In this paper a case is presented that on-line health information particularly benefits the already privileged in terms of health care; well-educated people with access to economic resources. Several intervention points are suggested to improve Internet health information accessibility and use for all population groups. Interventions at an institutional level include improving equity of Internet access through the provision of free services at strategic sites and improving the readability and cultural acceptability of health information. Individually focused interventions involve skill development to enable effective navigation of Internet sites, identification of patient and families' information needs and support to develop evaluation skills. The effectiveness of these interventions in reducing disparities is reliant on nurses and other health professionals' expertise in accessing, evaluating and using Internet health information in their clinical practise. On-line health information is a powerful medium for quick and dynamic knowledge distribution. The challenge for nurses and other health professionals is directing that knowledge to the groups most disadvantaged in the current health care systems, with an agenda of reducing inequalities in access to health information.

AB Rural living poses special challenges (and opportunities) for the significant health information intermediary role that women enact. The authors describe interviews with 40 women living in a rural, medically underserved county in southwestern Ontario, Canada, who discussed their information-seeking experiences and the strategies used to find information about a chronic health concern or an acute medical problem. The women's stories reveal that they define health very broadly and that their information seeking is influenced by contextual factors, such as rural living and gender roles, that interplay with their self-reliance, health literacy, and the availability and willingness of others in professional and nonprofessional roles to give support within relationships of care. The authors discuss themes emerging from the interviews in connection with the apparent mismatch between women's lived realities and the policy assumptions supporting the development of e-health strategies for providing health information to people living in rural and remote communities.

AB Self-reporting is a common, convenient, and inexpensive method for collecting health status information in HIV/AIDS research, but the reliability and validity of these data remain suspect. HIV-positive persons (n=174) completed self-report measures of demographics, health status, and health literacy, and provided permission to collect CD4 cell counts and viral load results from provider charts. Clinically meaningful categories of CD4 cell counts were reliably and validly assessed using self-report measures. Self-reported viral load, however, demonstrated only marginally acceptable reliability and validity, with the greatest validity occurring for recall of undetectable viral load. Self-reported health status was most reliable and valid for persons with higher levels of education and literacy. CD4 cell counts can therefore be reliably and validly assessed through self-reporting, particularly when collected in clinically meaningful units from persons with higher education. Self-reported viral load should be interpreted with caution and is most reliable when dichotomized into detectable/undetectable categories.

AB Purpose The study purpose was to explore the relationships among health literacy, self-efficacy, and self-care behaviors of patients with type 2 diabetes. Data sources A cross-sectional study with a descriptive correlational design was conducted. Patients (N= 150) with type 2 diabetes were recruited from diabetes clinics in the Marshall Islands. Levels of health literacy, self-efficacy, and self-care behaviors were assessed by a questionnaire. Conclusions Health literacy, receiving diabetes education, and employment status together explained 11.8% of the variance in self-efficacy (F(3,147)= 7.58, p < .001). Patients who had higher health literacy, received more diabetes-related education, were currently employed and had better self-efficacy. Self-efficacy and marital status together explained 16.7% of the variance in self-care behaviors (F(2,148)= 15.96, p < .001). Patients who had higher self-efficacy and who were married had better self-care behaviors. Implications for practice Strategies are needed to incorporate the concept of self-efficacy in the design of diabetes education to promote patients' self-care behaviors, with an emphasis on dealing with hyper- or hypoglycemia, following the diet plan, and checking blood sugar levels as recommended. Diabetes education material that requires a lower literacy level may be needed for older or unemployed adult populations.

TI Mental Health Literacy of Depression: Gender Differences and Attitudinal
   Antecedents in a Representative British Sample
SO PLOS ONE

AB Background: Poor mental health literacy and negative attitudes toward individuals with mental health disorders may impede optimal help-seeking for symptoms of mental ill-health. The present study examined the ability to recognize cases of depression as a function of respondent and target gender, as well as individual psychological differences in attitudes toward persons with depression.
   Methods: In a representative British general population survey, the ability to correctly recognize vignettes of depression was assessed among 1,218 adults. Respondents also rated the vignettes along a number of attitudinal dimensions and completed measures of attitudes toward seeking psychological help, psychiatric skepticism, and anti-scientific attitudes.
   Results: There were significant differences in the ability to correctly identify cases of depression as a function of respondent and target gender. Respondents were more likely to indicate that a male vignette did not suffer from a mental health disorder compared to a female vignette, and women were more likely than men to indicate that the male vignette suffered from a mental health disorder. Attitudes toward persons with depression were associated with attitudes toward seeking psychological help, psychiatric skepticism, and anti-scientific attitudes.
   Conclusion: Initiatives that consider the impact of gender stereotypes as well as individual differences may enhance mental health literacy, which in turn is associated with improved help-seeking behaviors for symptoms of mental ill-health.

AB When the antecedents of health-promoting behavior are explored, the concept of health literacy is deemed a factor of major influence. Originally defined as reading, writing and numeracy skills in the health domain, health literacy is now considered a multidimensional concept. The ongoing discussion on health literacy reveals that no agreement exists about which dimensions to include in the concept. To contribute to the development of a consistent and parsimonious concept of health literacy, we conducted a critical review of concepts in other literacy domains. Our review was guided by two research questions: (i) Which dimensions are included in the concepts of other literacy domains? (ii) How can health literacy research profit from other literacy domains? Based on articles collected from PubMed, PsycINFO, Communication Mass Media Complete, CINAHL, SAGE Full-Text Collection, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar as well as selected monographs and editions, we identified seven distinct dimensions. Some of the dimensions recur across all reviewed literacy domains and first attempts have been made to operationalize the dimensions. Expanding upon these dimensions, the paper discusses how they can prove useful for elaborating a consistent and parsimonious concept of health literacy and foster the development of a more holistic measure.

AB Objective: To evaluate the usefulness of a diabetes self-management guide and a brief counseling intervention in helping patients set and achieve their behavioral goals.
   Methods: We conducted a quasi-experimental study using a one group pretest posttest design to assess the effectiveness of a goal setting intervention along with a self-management guide. English- and Spanish-speaking patients with diabetes had one in-person session and two telephone follow-up calls with a non-clinical provider over a 12-16-week period. At each call and at the end of the study, we assessed success in achieving behavioral goals and problem solving toward those goals. Satisfaction with the self-management guide was assessed at the end of the study.
   Results: We enrolled 250 patients across three sites and 229 patients completed the study. Most patients chose to set goals in diet and exercise domains. 93% of patients achieved at least one behavioral goal during the study and 73% achieved at least two behavioral goals. Many patients exhibited problem solving behavior to achieve their goals. We found no significant differences in reported achievement of behavior goals by literacy or language. Patients were very satisfied with the guide.
   Conclusions: A brief goal setting intervention along with a diabetes self-management guide helped patients set and achieve healthy behavioral goals.
   Practice implications: Non-clinical providers can successfully help a diverse range of patients with diabetes set and achieve behavioral goals. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Tailored lay health worker intervention improves breast cancer screening

AB Despite rapidly increasing incidence rates of breast cancer, recent immigrants such as Korean-American (KA) women report disproportionately lower utilization of screening tests compared with other ethnic groups. Early screening of breast cancer for this population may be greatly facilitated by indigenous lay health workers (LHWs). We conducted an intervention trial with a 6-month follow-up. Trained LHWs recruited 100 KA women 40 years of age or older who had not had a mammogram during the past 2 years. Ninety-three completed follow-up questionnaires. A 120-min, in-class education combined with LHW follow-up counseling and navigation assistance through the health care system was provided. Rates of breast cancer screening behaviors significantly increased at 6 months (P < 0.001); changes between pre- and post-intervention were 31.9% for mammography, 23% for clinical breast examination and 36.2% for breast self-examination. Modesty toward screening significantly decreased over time, but we did not find any significant differences in breast cancer knowledge and beliefs before and after the intervention. Results support the efficacy of this neighborhood-based, culturally sensitive intervention. Further research should seek to replicate these findings and to incorporate more self-care skills such as health literacy when designing an intervention program for linguistically and culturally isolated immigrant women.

TI Literacy, Numeracy, and Portion-Size Estimation Skills
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID ENERGY-INTAKE; HEALTH LITERACY; WEIGHT
AB Background: Portion-size estimation is an important component of weight management. Literacy and numeracy skills may be important for accurate portion-size estimation. It was hypothesized that low literacy and numeracy would be associated with decreased accuracy in portion estimation.
   Methods: A cross-sectional Study of primary care patients was performed from July 2006 to August 2007; analyses were performed from January 2008 to October 2008. Literacy and numeracy were assessed with validated measures (the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine and the Wide Range Achievement Test, third edition). For three solid-food items and one liquid item, participants were asked to serve both a single serving and a specified weight or volume amount representing a single serving. Portion-size estimation was considered accurate if it fell within +/- 25% of a single standard serving.
   Results: Of 164 participants, 71% were women, 64% were white, and mean (SD) BMI was 30.6 (8.3) kg/m(2). While 91% reported completing high school, 24% had <9th-grade literacy skills and 67% had <9th-grade numeracy skills. When all items were combined, 65% of participants were accurate when asked to serve a single serving, and 62% were accurate when asked to serve a specified amount. In unadjusted analyses, both literacy and numeracy were associated with inaccurate estimation. In multivariate analyses, only lower literacy was associated with inaccuracy in serving a single serving (OR=2.54; 95% CI=1.11, 5.81).
   Conclusions: In this study, many participants had poor portion-size estimation skills. Lower literacy skills were associated with less accuracy when participants were asked to serve a single serving. Opportunities may exist to improve portion-size estimation by addressing literacy.

AB National governments across the globe have set goals to improve healthcare delivery. Understanding patient-provider communication is essential for the development of policies that measure how well a healthcare system delivers care.
   This study was designed to determine which, if any, demographic factors were independently associated with how US patients perceive various aspects of communication with their healthcare providers.
   The study was a secondary, cross-sectional analysis of nationally representative data from the 2002 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). Among US adults with a healthcare visit in the past year (n = approximately 16 700), we assessed the association between several covariate demographic and socioeconomic factors and four dependent measures of patient perceptions of communication with their healthcare providers.
   Across all four measures of communication, older patients were more likely to report positively. Having health insurance and a usual source of care were consistent predictors of positive perceptions of communication. Hispanic patients also reported better perceptions of communication across all four measures. The most economically disadvantaged patients were less likely to report that providers always explained things so that they understood. Male patients were more likely to report that providers always spent enough time with them.
   This study suggests that patient perceptions of communication in healthcare settings vary widely by demographics and other individual patient characteristics. In this paper, we discuss the relevance of these communication disparities to design policies to improve healthcare systems, both at the individual practice level and the national level.

AB Objective To understand lay beliefs and attitudes, religious teachings, and professional perceptions in relation to diabetes prevention in the Bangladeshi community.
   Design Qualitative study ( focus groups and semistructured interviews).
   Setting Tower Hamlets, a socioeconomically deprived London borough, United Kingdom.
   Participants Bangladeshi people without diabetes ( phase 1), religious leaders and Islamic scholars ( phase 2), and health professionals ( phase 3).
   Methods 17 focus groups were run using purposive sampling in three sequential phases. Thematic analysis was used iteratively to achieve progressive focusing and to develop theory. To explore tensions in preliminary data fictional vignettes were created, which were discussed by participants in subsequent phases. The PEN- 3 multilevel theoretical framework was used to inform data analysis and synthesis.
   Results Most lay participants accepted the concept of diabetes prevention and were more knowledgeable than expected. Practical and structural barriers to a healthy lifestyle were commonly reported. There was a strong desire to comply with cultural norms, particularly those relating to modesty. Religious leaders provided considerable support from Islamic teachings for messages about diabetes prevention. Some clinicians incorrectly perceived Bangladeshis to be poorly informed and fatalistic, although they also expressed concerns about their own limited cultural understanding.
   Conclusion Contrary to the views of health professionals and earlier research, poor knowledge was not the main barrier to healthy lifestyle choices. The norms and expectations of Islam offer many opportunities for supporting diabetes prevention. Interventions designed for the white population, however, need adaptation before they will be meaningful to many Bangladeshis. Religion may have an important part to play in supporting health promotion in this community. The potential for collaborative working between health educators and religious leaders should be explored further and the low cultural understanding of health professionals addressed.

   LITERACY
AB Despite advances in healthcare, heart failure patients continue to experience complications that could have been prevented or treated. This occurs because the only way that a therapeutic or preventive regimen can be effective, assuming that the patient's condition has been accurately diagnosed and appropriately treated, is if the patient implements self-care behaviors and adheres to the treatment regimen. However, it is widely accepted that this does not occur in many or even most instances. This article provides an overview of the current evidence related to adherence and self-care behaviors among heart failure patients and describes the state of the science on interventions developed and tested to enhance self-care maintenance in this population. Our review of literature shows that effective interventions integrate strategies that motivate, empower, and encourage patients to make informed decisions and assume responsibility for self-care. Gaps in current evidence support the need for additional research on ways to improve adherence and self-care for patients who are at an increased risk of poor adherence, including those with cognitive and functional impairments and low health literacy.

AB Objectives: To identify gender specific demographic, clinical, knowledge and attitudinal factors associated with stigma related to depression.
   Methods: Data were collected between February and. June 2006 in a probability sampled population-based survey of 3047 adults in Alberta, Canada. Measures included a depression stigma scale. Correlates of stigma were examined using bivariate analyses and linear regression modeling methods separately for men and women.
   Results: In multivariate linear regression models, correct identification of depression in a case description and agreement with health professionals about treatments were associated with lower stigma scores, regardless of gender. Endorsing GP/family doctors and taking medications as being the best help for depression was negatively associated with stigma scores in women. In men, endorsing family/friends as the best help for depression or "don't know" the best help for depression was positively associated with stigma scores. Women who had family/friends with depression had less stigma than women who did not have. This was not observed in men. Among male participants, significant interactions between being a health professional, having close family/ friends with depression and reporting "weakness of character" as a causal factor for depression were found.
   Conclusions: Improving mental health literacy may be one of the promising ways to reduce stigma associated with depression. Personal contacts with individuals with depression may have positive effects on stigma in women. Mental health education and promotion should clarify misconceptions about causes, treatments and risk factors for depression. Gender differences related to stigma should be considered in stigma reduction initiatives. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Considering the status of the Internet as a prominent source of health information, assessing online health material has become a central issue in patient education. We describe the strategies available to evaluate the characteristics of online health information, including readability, emotional content, understandability, usability.
   Methods: Popular tools used in assessment of readability, emotional content and comprehensibility of online health information were reviewed. Tools designed to evaluate both printed and online material were considered.
   Results: Readability tools are widely used in online health material evaluation and are highly covariant. Assessment of emotional content of online health-related communications via sentiment analysis tools is becoming more popular. Understandability and usability tools have been developed specifically for health-related material, but each tool has important limitations and has been tested on a limited number of health issues.
   Conclusion: Despite the availability of numerous assessment tools, their overall reliability differs between readability (high) and understandability (low). Approaches combining multiple assessment tools and involving both quantitative and qualitative observations would optimize assessment strategies.
   Practice implications: Effective assessment of online health information should rely on mixed strategies combining quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Assessment tools should be selected according to their functional properties and compatibility with target material. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Context: Nutrition knowledge can influence dietary choices and impact on athletic performance. Valid and reliable measures are needed to assess the nutrition knowledge of athletes and coaches. Objectives: (1) To systematically review the published literature on nutrition knowledge of adult athletes and coaches and (2) to assess the quality of measures used to assess nutrition knowledge. Data Sources: MEDLINE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscuss, Web of Science, and SCOPUS. Study Selection: 36 studies that provided a quantitative measure of nutrition knowledge and described the measurement tool that was used were included. Data extraction: Participant description, questionnaire description, results (mean correct and responses to individual items), study quality, and questionnaire quality. Data synthesis: All studies were of neutral quality. Tools used to measure knowledge did not consider health literacy, were outdated with regards to consensus recommendations, and lacked appropriate and adequate validation. The current status of nutrition knowledge in athletes and coaches is difficult to ascertain. Gaps in knowledge also remain unclear, but it is likely that energy density, the need for supplementation, and the role of protein are frequently misunderstood. Conclusions: Previous reports of nutrition knowledge need to be interpreted with caution. A new, universal, up-to-date, validated measure of general and sports nutrition knowledge is required to allow for assessment of nutrition knowledge.

AB Background: It has been argued that only 12% of adults have the necessary health literacy to manage their health care effectively, which can lead to difficulties in self-care activities, such as medication adherence. Prior research suggests that health literacy may influence knowledge, self-efficacy and self-care, but this has not been fully examined.
   Objective: To test a model to explain the relationships between health literacy, heart failure knowledge, self-efficacy, and self-care.
   Methods: Prior to receiving clinic-based education, newly referred patients to 3 heart failure clinics completed assessments of health literacy, heart failure knowledge, self-efficacy, self-care, and demographics. Structural equation modeling was completed to examine the strength of the inter-variable relationships.
   Results: Of 81 participants recruited, data from 63 patients were complete. Health literacy was independently associated with knowledge (P < 0.001). Health literacy was not related to self-care. Self-efficacy was independently-associated with self-care adherence (P = 0.016). No other relationships were statistically significant. The model had good fit (comparative fit index = 1.000) and explained 33.6% of the variance in knowledge and 27.6% in self-care.
   Conclusions: Health literacy influences knowledge about heart failure but not self-care adherence. Instead, self-efficacy influenced self-care adherence. Future research should incorporate additional factors that may better model the relationships between health literacy, knowledge, self-efficacy, and self-care. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB Literacy is an important determinant of health and well-being across the life span but is critical in aging, when many influential health and financial decisions are made. Prior studies suggest that older persons exhibit lower literacy than younger persons, particularly in the domains of financial and health literacy, but the reasons why remain unknown. The objectives of this study were to: (a) examine pathways linking diverse resources (i.e., education, word knowledge, cognitive function, and decision making style) to health and financial literacy among older persons and determine the extent to which the relation of age with literacy represents a direct effect versus an indirect effect due to decrements in specific cognitive functions (i.e., executive functions and episodic memory); and (b) test the hypothesis that declines in executive function and episodic memory are associated with lower literacy among older persons without dementia. Six-hundred and forty-five community-based older persons without dementia underwent detailed assessments of diverse resources, including education, word knowledge, cognitive function (i.e., executive function, episodic memory) and decision making style (i.e., risk aversion), and completed a measure of literacy that included items similar to those used in the Health and Retirement Study, such as numeracy, financial concepts such as compound inflation and knowledge of stocks and bonds, and important health concepts such as understanding of drug risk and Medicare Part D. Path analysis revealed a strong effect of age on literacy, with about half of the effect of age on literacy due to decrements in executive functions and episodic memory. In addition, executive function had an indirect effect on literacy via decision making style (i.e., risk aversion), and education and word knowledge had independent effects on literacy. Finally, among (n = 447) persons with repeated cognitive assessments available for up to 14 years, regression analysis supported the association of multiple resources with literacy; moreover, more rapid declines in executive function and episodic memory over an average of 6.4 years prior to the literacy assessment predicted lower literacy scores (ps < 0.02), but rate of decline in word knowledge did not. These findings suggest that diverse individual resources contribute to financial and health literacy and lower literacy in old age is partially due to declines in executive function and episodic memory.

AB The Early Growth and Development Study is a prospective adoption study of birth parents, adoptive parents, and adopted children recruited in two cohorts (N = 561 triads). The primary study aims are to examine how family, peer, and contextual processes affect children's adjustment, and to examine their interplay (mediation, moderation) with genetic influences. Participants were recruited through adoption agencies located throughout the United States following the birth of a child. Assessments are ongoing, in 9-month intervals until the child reaches 3 years of age and in 1-year intervals thereafter through age 9. Data collection includes the following primary constructs: child temperament, social behavior, school performance, mental health, and health; birth and adoptive parent personality characteristics, mental health, competence, stress, health, context, substance use, parenting, and marital relations; and pregnancy use of drugs and maternal stress during pregnancy. DNA and salivary cortisol samples have also been collected. Analyses have indicated evidence for genotype-environment interactions during early childhood. Study procedures, sample representativeness (including tests of potential confounds in the adoption design), and an overview of findings to date are summarized, and future plans are described.

AB National priorities and recent federal initiatives have brought health literacy to the forefront in providing safe accessible care. Having valid and reliable health literacy measures is a critical factor in meeting patients' health literacy needs. In this study, the authors examined variation across three brief health literacy instruments in categorizing health literacy levels and identifying associated factors. The authors screened 378 veterans using the short form of the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults; the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine; and a 4-Item Brief Health Literacy Screening Tool (known as the BRIEF). They analyzed data using prevalence estimates, Pearson product moment correlations, and logistic regression. When categorizing individuals' health literacy, agreement among instruments was present for 37% of the sample. There were consistencies; however, categorization and estimated risk factors varied by instrument. Depending on instrument, increased age, low education, minority status, and self-reported poor reading level were associated with low health literacy. Findings suggest that these instruments measure health literacy differently and are likely conceptually different. As the use of health literacy screening gains momentum, alignment between instrument and intended purpose is essential; in some cases, multiple instruments may be appropriate. When selecting an instrument, one should consider style of administration, purpose for measure, and availability of time and resources.

   BEHAVIOR; PATIENT
AB The relationship between limited health literacy and poor health may be due, in part, to poor communication quality within health care delivery organizations. We explored the relationship between health literacy status and receiving patient-centered communication in clinics and hospitals serving communication-vulnerable patient populations. Thirteen health care organizations nationwide distributed a survey to 5929 patients. All patients completed seven items assessing patient-centered communication. One third also completed three items assessing health literacy. The majority of patients had self-reported health literacy challenges, reporting problems learning about their medical condition because of difficulty understanding written information (53%), a lack of confidence in completing medical forms by themselves (61%), and needing someone to help them read hospital/clinic materials (57%). Logistic regression models showed that, after adjustment for patient demographic characteristics and health care organization type, patients with limited health literacy were 28% to 79% less likely than those with adequate health literacy to report their health care organization oalwayso provides patient-centered communication across seven communication items. Using a scaled composite of these items, limited health literacy remained associated with lower reported communication quality. These results suggest that improving communication quality in health care organizations might help to address the challenges facing patients with limited health literacy. They also highlight that efforts to address the needs of patients with limited health literacy should be sensitive to the range of communication challenges confronting these patients and their caregivers.

AB Objective: Multimedia diabetes education programs (MDEP) have the potential to improve communication and education of those with low health literacy. We examined the effect of a MDEP targeted to patients with low literacy on knowledge and assessed the association between literacy and knowledge improvement.
   Methods: We showed the MDEP to 190 patients recruited from clinics at a federally qualified health center and an academic health center. We measured diabetes knowledge before and after viewing the MDEP.
   Results: Seventy-nine percent of patients had adequate literacy, 13% marginal, and 8% inadequate literacy. Patients across all literacy levels had significant increases in knowledge scores after viewing the MIDEP (p-value < 0.001). Patients with inadequate literacy learned significantly less after the MDEP (adjusted beta-coefficient = -2.3, SE = 0.70) compared to those with adequate literacy.
   Conclusions: A MDEP designed for those with low literacy significantly increased diabetes knowledge across literacy levels. However, the MDEP did not overcome the learning gap between patients with low and high literacy.
   Practice implications: A literacy appropriate MDEP may be an effective way to teach patients about diabetes. Combining the MDEP with other education methods may improve comprehension and learning among those with low literacy. Research is needed to identify which characteristics of low-literate patients influence the ability to learn health information. Identifying these factors and incorporating solutions into a diabetes education intervention may help bridge the learning gap related to literacy status. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Background and Purpose-Public stroke recognition is poor and poses a barrier to acute stroke treatment. We describe a stroke literacy program that teaches elementary school children in high-risk communities to recognize stroke and form an urgent action plan; we then present results of an intervention study using the program.
   Methods-"Hip-Hop" Stroke uses culturally and age-appropriate music and dance to enhance an interactive didactic curriculum including the FAST mnemonic (Facial droop, Arm weakness, Speech disturbance, Time to call 911). The program occurred in central Harlem, New York City, a community with high stroke risk. During the 2006 to 2007 school year, 582 fourth, fifth, and sixth graders (9 to 11 years of age) participated in 1-hour sessions over 3 consecutive days. Stroke knowledge was tested before and after the program with a 94% group participant retention.
   Results-Students learned and retained knowledge well for stroke localization (20% correct before intervention, 93% correct immediately afterward, and 86% correct after 3-month delay; P < 0.001 both posttests versus baseline), the term "brain attack" (16% pretest, 95% immediate, 86% delayed; P < 0.001), and to call 911 for stroke (78% pretest, 99.8% immediate, 98% delayed; P < 0.001). FAST stroke symptoms (facial droop and slurred speech) were better retained than non-FAST symptoms (headache and blurred vision) at 3 months (P < 0.001). For stroke prevention measures, dietary change and exercise were better learned than concepts of diabetes, hypertension, and cholesterol.
   Conclusions-Elementary school children are educable about stroke, retain their knowledge well, and may be able to appropriately activate emergency services for acute stroke. Incorporating cultural elements such as hip-hop music may improve retention of stroke knowledge among the youth.

TI Monitoring awareness of and attitudes to depression in Australia
SO MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
LA English
DT Article
ID MENTAL-HEALTH LITERACY; DISORDERS; PREVALENCE; BELIEFS
AB Objectives: To determine the degree of recognition and understanding of depression and its treatments in Australia in 2001, and detail factors and personal experiences that influence awareness of and attitudes to depression.
   Design and setting: Cross-sectional survey of a representative community sample (900 randomly selected respondents), via telephone interview, conducted 5-7 October 2001.
   Main outcome measures: Reports of community awareness, knowledge and attitudes to depression and its treatments in Australia.
   Results: The Australian community does not view mental health as a major general health issue. When asked specifically, depression was recognised as the most common mental health problem. Recognition of depression was greater among women and younger people. Most people (58%; 508/879) reported that they or a family member had experienced depression. People younger than 55 years and people with personal or family experiences of depression viewed depression as more disabling than other chronic medical conditions. Half the respondents differentiated depression from normal sadness. Awareness of common risk versus protective factors was limited. Most people endorsed a preference for self-help and nonpharmacological treatments, but community views of antidepressant drugs were less negative than expected. General practitioners were identified as the preferred point of first contact among healthcare professionals.
   Conclusions: Although mental health is still not highlighted as a major health issue, Australians do recognise depression as the major mental health problem. Women and younger people have more substantial knowledge about key aspects of depression and its treatments.

AB Background
   Growing evidence that patient engagement improves health outcomes and reduces health care costs has fueled health providers' focus on patient portals as the primary access point for personal health information and patient-provider communication. Whereas much attention has been given to identifying characteristics of older adults who do and do not adopt patient portals and necessary adaptions to portal design, little is known about their attitudes and perceptions regarding patient portal use as a tool for engagement in their health care within the context of health literacy, experience navigating Web-based health information, and previous patient portal use. Objective The specific aims of this study were to explore attitudes toward portal adoption and its perceived usefulness as a tool for health care engagement among adults (65 years and older) who have varying levels of health literacy and degrees of prior patient portal use.
   Methods
   A phone survey of 100 community dwelling adults gathered sociodemographic, health, and technology related information. Older adults were purposefully selected for 4 follow-up focus groups based on survey responses to health literacy and previous patient portal use. A mixed-method approach was used to integrate phone survey data with thematic analysis of 4 focus groups. Due to variability in attitudes between focus group participants, an individual case analysis was performed and thematic patterns were used as the basis for subgroup formation.
   Results
   Differences in health literacy, comfort navigating health information on the Web, and previous portal experience explained some but not all differences related to the 7 themes that emerged in the focus groups analysis. Individual cases who shared attitudes were arranged into 5 subgroups from least to most able and willing to engage in health care via a patient portal. The subgroups' overall portal adoption attitudes were: (1) Don't want to feel pushed into anything, (2) Will only adopt if required, (3) Somebody needs to help me, (4) See general convenience of the portal for simple tasks and medical history, but prefer human contact for questions, and (5) Appreciates current features and excited about new possibilities.
   Conclusions
   Most of the older adults are interested in using a patient portal regardless of health literacy level, previous patient portal adoption, or experience navigating health information on the Web. Research targeting informal caregivers of older adults who are unable or unwilling to engage with information technology in health care on their own is warranted. Health care organizations should consider tailored strategies to meet the needs of older adults (and their informal caregivers) and explore alternative workflows that integrate patient portal information into phone conversations and face-to-face contact with health care providers.

AB Purpose To examine the relationship between patient-rated physician empathy and patient satisfaction after a single new hand surgery office visit.
   Methods Directly after the office visit, 112 consecutive new patients rated their overall satisfaction with the provider and completed the Consultation and Relational Empathy Measure, the Newest Vital Sign health literacy test, a sociodemographic survey, and 3 Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-based questionnaires: Pain Interference, Upper-Extremity Function, and Depression. We also measured the waiting time in the office to see the physician, the duration of the visit, and the time from booking until appointment. Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were used to identify factors independently associated with patient satisfaction.
   Results Patient-rated physician empathy correlated strongly with the degree of overall satisfaction with the provider. After controlling for confounding effects, greater empathy was independently associated with patient satisfaction, and it alone accounted for 65% of the variation in satisfaction scores. Older patient age was also associated with satisfaction. There were no differences between satisfied and dissatisfied patients with regard to waiting time in the office, duration of the appointment, time from booking until appointment, and health literacy.
   Conclusions Physician empathy was the strongest driver of patient satisfaction in the hand surgery office setting. As patient satisfaction plays a growing role in reimbursement, targeted educational programs to enhance empathic communication skills in hand surgeons merit consideration.

AB Background-More than 30% of patients hospitalized for heart failure are rehospitalized or die within 90 days of discharge. Lower health literacy is associated with mortality among outpatients with chronic heart failure; little is known about this relationship after hospitalization for acute heart failure.
   Methods and Results-Patients hospitalized for acute heart failure and discharged home between November 2010 and June 2013 were followed through December 31, 2013. Nurses administered the Brief Health Literacy Screen at admission; low health literacy was defined as Brief Health Literacy Screen <= 9. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were time to first rehospitalization and, separately, time to first emergency department visit within 90 days of discharge. Cox proportional hazards models determined their relationships with health literacy, adjusting for age, gender, race, insurance, education, comorbidity, and hospital length of stay. For the 1379 patients, average age was 63.1 years, 566 (41.0%) were female, and 324 (23.5%) had low health literacy. Median follow-up was 20.7 months (interquartile range 12.8 to 29.6 months), and 403 (29.2%) patients died. Adjusted hazard ratio for death among patients with low health literacy was 1.34 (95% CI 1.04, 1.73, P=0.02) compared to Brief Health Literacy Screen >9. Within 90 days of discharge, there were 415 (30.1%) rehospitalizations and 201 (14.6%) emergency department visits, with no evident association with health literacy.
   Conclusions-Lower health literacy was associated with increased risk of death after hospitalization for acute heart failure. There was no evident relationship between health literacy and 90-day rehospitalization or emergency department visits.

AB BACKGROUND: Low health literacy in parents can potentially impact understanding of a child's diagnosis and treatment course. No reviews have addressed parent health literacy in the emergency department (ED), the relationship between parent health literacy and child ED utilization, or the impact of low literacy interventions on child ED utilization.
   OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the peer-reviewed literature pertaining to parental health literacy and ED utilization. The following key questions were addressed: question (Q) 1) What is the prevalence of low health literacy, as estimated by validated health literacy measures, of parents in the ED? Q2) Is parent low health literacy related to ED use for children? Q3) Do low literacy interventions targeting parents likely to have low health literacy affect ED use for children? DATA SOURCES: The authors reviewed 483 unduplicated titles and abstracts published between 1980 and May 2012 using PubMed and CINABL, with 117 retained for full review and 17 included in the final analytic review.
   STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: All included articles had a valid measure of parent health literacy and a Q1) descriptive measurement of the population, Q2) ED utilization, or Q3) utilized a low literacy educational intervention.
   STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: One author extracted data verified by a second author. Studies were rated for quality by both authors.
   RESULTS: Q1) A median of 30% (interquartile range 22-36%) of parents in the ED possesses low health literacy. Q2) Studies investigating the relationship between health literacy and ED yielded mixed results. Q3) Seven of 8 low literacy interventions were associated with a reduction in ED use. Random effects pooled odds ratios from 6 studies showed intervention effectiveness (odds ratio 0.35; 95% CI 0.15-0.81).
   LIMITATIONS: No intervention studies measured health literacy, limiting the ability to determine whether the low literacy intervention targeted health literacy.
   CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: Roughly 1 in 3 parents of children presenting to the ED have low health literacy. Importantly, interventions targeting parents likely to have low health literacy have an impact in reducing ED utilization.

ID OUTCOMES; FIELD
AB Background: Health literacy has been defined as the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand the basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Currently, few studies have validated the causal pathways of determinants of health literacy through the use of statistical modeling. The purpose of the present study was to develop and validate a health literacy model at an individual level that could best explain the determinants of health literacy and the associations between health literacy and health behaviors even health status.
   Methods: Skill-based health literacy test and a self-administrated questionnaire survey were conducted among 3222 Chinese adult residents. Path analysis was applied to validate the model.
   Results: The model explained 38.6% of variance for health literacy, 11.7% for health behavior and 2.3% for health status: (GFI = 0.9990; RMR = 0.0521; chi(2) = 10.2151, P = 0.1159). Education has positive and direct effect on prior knowledge (beta = 0.324) and health literacy (beta = 0.346). Health literacy is also affected by prior knowledge (beta = 0.245) and age (beta = -0.361). Health literacy is a direct influencing factor of health behavior (beta = 0.101). The most important factor of health status is age (beta = 0.107). Health behavior and health status have a positive interaction effect.
   Conclusion: This model explains the determinants of health literacy and the associations between health literacy and health behaviors well. It could be applied to develop intervention strategies to increase individual health literacy, and then to promote health behavior and health status.

ID HEALTH LITERACY; INTERNET
AB Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the readability of online patient education materials among academic otolaryngology departments in the mid-Atlantic region, with the purpose of determining whether these commonly used online resources were written at a level readily understood by the average American.
   Methods: A readability analysis of online patient education materials was performed using several commonly used readability assessments including the Flesch Reading Ease Score, the FleschKincaid Grade Level, Simple Measure of Gobbledygook, Gunning Frequency of Gobbledygook, the New Dale-Chall Test, the Coleman-Liau Index, the New Fog Count, the Raygor Readability Estimate, the FORCAST test, and the Fry Graph.
   Results: Most patient education materials from these programs were written at or above an 11th grade reading level, considerably above National Institutes of Health guidelines for recommended difficulty.
   Conclusions: Patient educational materials from academic otolaryngology Web sites are written at too difficult a reading level for a significant portion of patients and can be simplified. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess parental health literacy and numeracy skills in understanding instructions for caring for young children, and to develop and validate a new parental health literacy scale, the Parental Health Literacy Activities Test (PHLAT).
   METHODS: Caregivers of infants (age <13 months) were recruited in a cross-sectional study at pediatric clinics at 3 academic medical centers. Literacy and numeracy skills were assessed with previously validated instruments. Parental health literacy was assessed with the new 20-item PHLAT. Psychometric analyses were performed to assess item characteristics and to generate a shortened, 10-item version (PHLAT-10).
   RESULTS: A total of 182 caregivers were recruited. Although 99% had adequate literacy skills, only 17% had better than ninth-grade numeracy skills. Mean score on the PHLAT was 68% (standard deviation 18); for example, only 47% of caregivers could correctly describe how to mix infant formula from concentrate, and only 69% could interpret a digital thermometer to determine whether an infant had a fever. Higher performance on the PHLAT was significantly correlated (P < .001) with education, literacy skill, and numeracy level (r = 0.29, 0.38, and 0.55 respectively). Caregivers with higher PHLAT scores were also more likely to interpret age recommendations for cold medications correctly (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.02, 2.6). Internal reliability on the PHLAT was good (Kuder-Richardson coefficient of reliability = 0.76). The PHLAT-10 also demonstrated good validity and reliability.
   CONCLUSIONS: Many parents do not understand common health information required to care for their infants. The PHLAT and PHLAT-10 have good reliability and validity and may be useful tools for identifying parents who need better communication of health-related instructions.

TI Health literacy, antiretroviral adherence, and HIV-RNA suppression - A

AB Background: Low health literacy has been associated with worse adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and higher HIV-RNA levels, but these relationships have not been evaluated in longitudinal analyses.
   Methods: We evaluated literacy using the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) (<= 6th grade, 7th to 8th grade, >= 9th grade) in the HIV-Alcohol Longitudinal Cohort study of HIV-infected persons with a history of alcohol problems, conducted from 1997 to 2001. We tested HIV-RNA levels and administered a standardized questionnaire regarding demographics, substance use, receipt of ART, and adherence with ART, every 6 months for up to 7 occasions. Among the 235 subjects on ART, we investigated the relationship between literacy and 2 outcomes: 100% 3-day self-reported adherence and HIV-RNA suppression (< 500 copies).
   Results: Subjects' literacy levels were the following: 14% <= 6th grade, 29% 7th to 8th grade, and 57% >= 9th grade. In 66% of the observations (478/725), subjects reported 100% 3-day adherence with ART. Of the 685 HIV-RNA assays from these subjects, 62% had < 500 copies. In unadjusted analyses, subjects with the lowest literacy level (<= 6th grade) had a higher odds of adherence (odds ratio [OR] 2.23, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 4.30) and HIV-RNA suppression (OR 2.01, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 3.90) compared with those with >= 9th grade literacy. This trend persisted but was no longer statistically significant in adjusted models of adherence (AOR 1.93, 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 4.31) and HIV-RNA suppression (AOR 1.70, 95% confidence interval 0.79 to 3.65).
   Conclusions: Contrary to our hypothesis, low literacy was not associated with a lower odds of adherence or virologic suppression in this longitudinal analysis of HIV-infected patients with a history of alcohol problems. Indeed, trends in these data suggest the possibility that low literacy may be associated with a higher odds of adherence and virologic suppression. These counterintuitive findings underscore the need to pursue a fuller understanding of the mechanisms by which literacy affects health outcomes.

AB IMPORTANCE Advance care planning improves the receipt of medical care aligned with patients' values; however, it remains suboptimal among diverse patient populations. To mitigate literacy, cultural, and language barriers to advance care planning, easy-to-read advance directives and a patient-directed, online advance care planning program called PREPARE For Your Care (PREPARE) were created in English and Spanish.
   OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy of PREPARE plus an easy-to-read advance directive with an advance directive alone to increase advance care planning documentation and patient-reported engagement.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A comparative efficacy randomized clinical trial was conducted from February 1, 2014, to November 30, 2017, at 4 safety-net, primary-care clinics in San Francisco among 986 English-speaking or Spanish-speaking primary care patients 55 years or older with 2 or more chronic or serious illnesses.
   INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized to PREPARE plus an easy-to-read advance directive (PREPARE arm) or the advance directive alone. There were no clinician-level or system-level interventions. Staff were blinded for all follow-up measurements.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was documentation of new advance care planning (ie, legal forms and/or documented discussions) at 15 months. Patient-reported outcomes included advance care planning engagement at baseline, 1 week, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months using validated surveys. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed using mixed-effects logistic and linear regression, controlling for time, health literacy, and baseline advance care planning, clustering by physician, and stratifying by language.
   RESULTS Among the 986 participants (603 women and 383 men), the mean (SD) age was 63.3 (6.4) years, 387 of 975 (39.7%) had limited health literacy, and 445 (45.1%) were Spanish speaking. No participant characteristic differed between the 2 groups, and retention was 85.9%(832 of 969) among survivors. Compared with the advance directive alone, PREPARE resulted in a higher rate of advance care planning documentation (unadjusted, 43.0% [207 of 481] vs 33.1% [167 of 505]; P<.001; adjusted, 43.0% vs 32.0%; P<.001) and higher self-reported increased advance care planning engagement scores (98.1% vs 89.5%; P<.001). Results remained significant among English speakers and Spanish speakers.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The patient-facing PREPARE program and an easy-to-read advance directive, without clinician-level or system-level interventions, increased documentation of advance care planning and patient-reported engagement, with statistically higher gains for PREPARE vs advance directive alone. These tools may mitigate literacy and language barriers to advance care planning, allow patients to begin planning on their own, and could substantially improve the process for diverse English-speaking and Spanish-speaking populations.

AB Objective: To investigate unmet information needs in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients over the course of cancer treatment and its association with health literacy.
   Methods: We present results from a prospective, multicenter cohort study (PIAT). Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients (N = 1060) were surveyed directly after breast cancer surgery, 10 and 40 weeks later. Pooled linear regression modeling was employed analyzing changes in unmet information needs over time and its association with health literacy.
   Results: Unmet information needs on side effects and medication and medical examination results and treatment options were high and increased during the first 10 weeks after breast cancer surgery. Considering health promotion and social issues, unmet information needs started high and decreased during post-treatment. Patients with limited health literacy had higher unmet information needs.
   Conclusion: Our results indicate a mismatch in information provision and breast cancer patients' information needs. Patients with limited health literacy may be at a distinct disadvantage in having their information needs met over the course of breast cancer treatment.
   Practice implications: Strategies are needed to reduce unmet information needs in breast cancer patients considering treatment-phase and health literacy and thereby enable them to better cope with their diseases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Multifactorial interventions are crucial to arrest the threat posed by infectious diseases. Public involvement requires adequate information, but determinants such as health literacy can impact on the effective use of such knowledge. The influence of health literacy on infectious diseases is examined in this paper.
   Methods: Databases were searched from January 1999 through July 2015 seeking studies reporting on health literacy and infections such tuberculosis, malaria, and influenza, and infection-related behaviours such as vaccination and hand hygiene. HIV was excluded, as comprehensive reviews have already been published.
   Results: Studies were found on antibiotic knowledge and use, the adoption of influenza and MMR immunizations, and screening for sexually transmitted and viral hepatitis infections. There was a lack of investigations on areas such as tuberculosis, malaria, hand hygiene, and diarrhoeal diseases.
   Conclusions: Limited or insufficient health literacy was associated with reduced adoption of protective behaviours such as immunization, and an inadequate understanding of antibiotics, although the relationship was not consistent. Large gaps remain in relation to infectious diseases with a high clinical and societal impact, such as tuberculosis and malaria. (C) 2016 The Authors.

TI Health Literacy and Health-Related Quality of Life Among a

AB Health-related quality of life is an important outcome in cancer care. A few studies indicate that health literacy influences cancer patients' health-related quality of life, but additional investigation is needed. The authors examined the relation between health literacy and health-related quality of life among cancer patients. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with cancer patients in Wisconsin during 2006-2007. Data on sociodemographics, clinical characteristics, health-related quality of life, and health literacy were obtained from the state's cancer registry and a mailed questionnaire. Regression analyses were used to characterize the association between health-related quality of life and health literacy. The study sample included 1,841 adults, newly diagnosed with lung, breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer in 2004 (response rate=68%). Health-related quality of life was measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General. Adjusting for confounders, higher health literacy was associated with greater health-related quality of life (p<.0001). Controlling for covariates, we found significant differences between those in the highest and lowest health literacy categories (p<.0001) and in the physical (p<.0001), functional (p<.0001), emotional (p<.0001), and social (p=.0007) well-being subscales. These associations exceeded the minimally important difference threshold for overall health-related quality of life and functional well-being. Health literacy is positively and independently associated with health-related quality of life among cancer patients. These findings support adoption of health literacy best practices by cancer care systems.

AB Communication and language barriers isolate Deaf American Sign Language (ASL) users from mass media, health care messages, and health care communication, which, when coupled with social marginalization, places them at a high risk for inadequate health literacy. Our objectives were to translate, adapt, and develop an accessible health literacy instrument in ASL and to assess the prevalence and correlates of inadequate health literacy among Deaf ASL users and hearing English speakers using a cross-sectional design. A total of 405 participants (166 Deaf and 239 hearing) were enrolled in the study. The Newest Vital Sign was adapted, translated, and developed into an ASL version (ASL-NVS). We found that 48% of Deaf participants had inadequate health literacy, and Deaf individuals were 6.9 times more likely than hearing participants to have inadequate health literacy. The new ASL-NVS, available on a self-administered computer platform, demonstrated good correlation with reading literacy. The prevalence of Deaf ASL users with inadequate health literacy is substantial, warranting further interventions and research.

AB Objective: Evaluate the evidence regarding the relative effectiveness of multimedia and print as modes of dissemination for patient education materials; examine whether development of these materials addressed health literacy.
   Methods: A structured literature review utilizing Medline, PsycInfo, and the Cumulative Index to the Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), supplemented by reference mining.
   Results: Of 738 studies screened, 30 effectively compared multimedia and print materials. Studies offered 56 opportunities for assessing the effect of medium on various outcomes (e.g., knowledge). In 30 instances (54%), no difference was noted between multimedia and print in terms of patient outcomes. Multimedia led to better outcomes vs. print in 21 (38%) comparisons vs. 5 (9%) instances for print. Regarding material development, 12 studies (40%) assessed readability and 5 (17%) involved patients in tool development.
   Conclusions: Multimedia appears to be a promising medium for patient education; however, the majority of studies found that print and multimedia performed equally well in practice. Few studies involved patients in material development, and less than half assessed the readability of materials.
   Practice implications: Future research should focus on comparing message-equivalent tools and assessing their effect on behavioral outcomes. Material development should include explicit attention to readability and patient input. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS

DE Health literacy; Systematic review
ID IDENTIFY PATIENTS; ADULT LITERACY; CARE; QUESTIONS; INTERNET;
   TECHNOLOGY; AMERICAN; MEDICINE; SKILLS
AB Objective: To systematically review current health literacy (HL) instruments for use in consumer-facing and mobile health information technology screening and evaluation tools.
   Design: The databases, PubMed, OVID, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library and Science Citation Index, were searched for health literacy assessment instruments using the terms "health", "literacy", "computer-based," and "psychometrics". All instruments identified by this method were critically appraised according to their reported psychometric properties and clinical feasibility.
   Results: Eleven different health literacy instruments were found. Screening questions, such as asking a patient about his/her need for assistance in navigating health information, were evaluated in seven different studies and are promising for use as a valid, reliable, and feasible computer-based approach to identify patients that struggle with low health literacy. However, there was a lack of consistency in the types of screening questions proposed. There is also a lack of information regarding the psychometric properties of computer-based health literacy instruments.
   Limitations: Only English language health literacy assessment instruments were reviewed and analyzed.
   Conclusions: Current health literacy screening tools demonstrate varying benefits depending on the context of their use. In many cases, it seems that a single screening question may be a reliable, valid, and feasible means for establishing health literacy. A combination of screening questions that assess health literacy and technological literacy may enable tailoring eHealth applications to user needs. Further research should determine the best screening question(s) and the best synthesis of various instruments' content and methodologies for computer-based health literacy screening and assessment.

AB OBJECTIVE: Although low parent health literacy (HL) has been linked to poor child health outcomes, it is not known whether differences in perceptions related to access to care and provider-parent partnership in care are potential contributing factors. We sought to assess whether parent HL is associated with differences in perceived barriers to care and attitudes regarding participatory decision-making with the provider.
   METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of data collected from parents presenting with their child to an urban public hospital pediatric clinic in New York City. Dependent variables were caregiver-reported barriers to care (ability to reach provider at night/on weekends, difficult travel to clinic) and attitudes towards participatory decision-making (feeling like a partner, relying on doctor's knowledge, leaving decisions up to the doctor, being given choices/asked opinion). The primary independent variable was caregiver HL (Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults [S-TOHFLA]).
   RESULTS: A total of 823 parents were assessed; 1 in 4 (27.0%) categorized as having low HL. Parents with low HL were more likely to report barriers to care than those with adequate HL: trouble reaching provider nights/weekends, 64.9% vs. 49.6%, (p < 0.001, adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.7, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.2-2.4); difficult travel, 15.3% vs. 8.0%, (p = 0.004, AOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0). Low HL was also associated with not feeling like a partner (28.8% vs. 17.1%; AOR 2.0; 95% Cl 1.4-3.0), preference for relying on the doctor's knowledge (68.9% vs. 52.2%; AOR 1.7; 95% Cl 1.2-2.4), and preference for leaving decisions up to the doctor (57.7% vs. 33.3%; AOR 2.2; 95% Cl 1.6-3.1).
   CONCLUSIONS: Addressing issues of parent HL may be helpful in ameliorating barriers to care and promoting provider-parent partnership in care.

AB Background: Racial minorities have poorer cancer survival in the United States compared to whites. The purpose of this study was to better understand patients' barriers to cancer care and to determine which patients have a greater need for assistance from a patient navigator.
   Methods: Community health workers assisted newly-diagnosed breast and colorectal cancer patients during a randomized trial of patient navigation and collected information about patients' barriers. Barriers to care were characterized and compared between non-Hispanic white and minority patients. A multivariate model was constructed of factors associated with increased log navigation time, a measure of patients' need for assistance.
   Results: Patients' (n = 103) most commonly identified barriers to care included a lack of social support, insurance/financial concerns, and problems communicating with health care providers. Barriers differed between nonminority and minority patients, and minority patients faced a greater number of barriers (p = .0001). In univariate analysis, log navigation time was associated with race/ethnicity, education, income, employment, insurance type, health literacy, marital status, language, and comorbidity. A multivariate model (R-2 = 0.43) for log navigation time was created using step-wise selection, and included the following factors: minority race/ethnicity (p = .032), non-full-time employment (p = .0004), unmarried status (p = .085), university center (p = .0005), and months in study (p < .0001).
   Conclusions: Newly diagnosed cancer patients' most common barriers to care include lack of social support, insurance/financial concerns, and problems with health care communications. In this sample of patients, a greater need for assistance was independently associated with minority race/ethnicity and unemployment. These data may help in the design and targeting of interventions to reduce cancer health disparities.

TI Health literacy A new concept for general practice?
SO AUSTRALIAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN
LA English
DT Article
ID CARE
AB Background
   Health literacy is the ability to understand and interpret the meaning of health information in written, spoken or digital form and how this motivates people to embrace or disregard actions relating to health.
   Objective
   This article aims to describe the concept of health literacy, its importance and its applications in the general practice setting.
   Discussion
   Australia trails behind other western countries in practical applications of health literacy. Health literacy underpins the efficiency of consultations, health promotion efforts, and self management programs. Recognition of the health literacy status of individuals allows use of appropriate communication tools. This can save time and effort and improve patient satisfaction and health outcomes.

AB Objective: Family caregivers play a significant role in the diagnosis, treatment, and recovery of individuals with cancer. This position paper reviews and links the research on family caregiving and health information with the importance of cancer literacy.
   Method: Review of literature obtained through searching in Academic Search Premier, EBSCO, Communication and Mass Media Complete, PsychArticles, PsycInfo, and Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition library databases.
   Results: Family members are important sources of health information, informal caregivers who learn and enact medical procedures, and influential aspects of patients' healthcare and treatment decision-making, but are not seriously considered by healthcare practitioners or researchers in terms of assessing and improving health literacy. Further, very few studies have directly examined or acknowledged the potential importance of family caregiver health literacy.
   Conclusion: The extent to which family caregivers can comprehend the health information they receive along with the patient is crucial for the patient to achieve the most successful health outcome.
   Practice implications: To acknowledge the impact that family caregiver health literacy could have on patient health outcomes, targeted practical recommendations for understanding family caregiver health literacy in the cancer context are proposed: (1) family member health literacy should be assessed; (2) close relational partners should be trained as peer health educators; (3) written cancer information should be provided directly to family caregivers; (4) health interactions between family caregivers and patients should be improved; (5) theoretical perspectives into the understanding of family caregiver health literacy should be integrated into practice; and (6) patient and family caregiver health literacy should be improved.

AB Objective: The impact of breast cancer is immense for all women, but the literature reveals an even greater impact on women of color and among socially and economically disadvantaged populations. Persistent differences in incidence and outcome are undoubtedly due to multiple factors, but one element in poor outcome may be treatment choice. Those treatments shown to be related to best outcomes are less likely to be chosen by certain groups of women. The effects of economic and cultural factors on breast cancer treatment choice have not been thoroughly explored; these factors must be understood if health care professionals are to intervene effectively to address disparities and improve breast cancer outcomes for all women.
   Methods: A review of the breast cancer literature was conducted in order to: (1) describe breast cancer disparities in the United States; (2) delineate factors that might contribute to those disparities; (3) assess possible mitigating factors for predominant causes; (4) begin to decide how health care interventions might allay the factors that contribute to disparities in breast cancer incidence and mortality.
   Results: Breast cancer incidence and outcome disparities in the United States are due to multiple interacting factors. These include information about treatment, different types of treatment, the emotional context of decision-making, and patient preference for level of involvement. Treatment decision-making is complex.
   Conclusion: Health literacy and level of decision-making involvement, both embedded in social and economic reality, are key components in breast cancer treatment decision-making and may contribute to breast cancer disparities in the United States. Current models of shared decision-making may not be generalizable to all breast cancer patients. Practice implications: Optimal breast cancer outcomes for all women depend on culturally and ethnically appropriate professional support. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVES. Eighty million US adults have low health literacy, a risk factor for increased health care use among adults. The purpose of this work was to assess the association between caregiver health literacy and the use and cost of child health services.
   METHODS. We conducted a cross-sectional study of caregiver-child dyads from a sample of children aged 12 months to 12 years presenting to the pediatric emergency department of an urban, public hospital. Caregiver health literacy was measured by the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in their preferred language (English or Spanish). Child health care use was measured by a 12-month retrospective review of the public hospital system's electronic database and of state Medicaid billing records for 4 types of visits: preventive care, urgent care, emergency care, and hospital care. Cost of child health care use was provided by Medicaid billing records. Multivariate analysis included caregiver education, age, and language proficiency, as well as child age, special health care needs, ethnicity, and health-insurance coverage.
   RESULTS. A total of 290 dyads were enrolled in the study. Twenty-two percent of caregivers had low (inadequate or marginal) health literacy. Caregivers with low health literacy were more likely to have less than a high school education, to have limited English proficiency, and to have been born outside the United States. There were no differences in health care use or cost between children of caregivers with low health literacy and children of caregivers with adequate health literacy. Three caregiver characteristics were associated with increased use of child health care services: born outside the United States, age at child's birth < 24 years, and limited English proficiency.
   CONCLUSIONS. One in 5 caregivers of young children has low health literacy. Caregiver health literacy, however, was not associated with disparities in the use of child health services in this inner-city, ethnic minority population.

AB Pharmaceutical management of HIV infection is complex, and proper adherence to antiretroviral regimens is contingent on active patient involvement in treatment. We examined the relationship between patient understanding of HIV and its treatment and health literacy. Structured interviews were conducted with 157 HIVinfected individuals receiving care at a community-based clinic in Shreveport, Louisiana, USA. In all, 48% of patients were reading below a 9th grade level. One-third of patients could not name their HIV medications and this was significantly related to low literacy (P < 0.01). Two-thirds of those reading below the 9th grade level did not know how to take their medications correctly (P < 0.05), and 75% did not know the meaning of a CD4 count or viral load (P < 0.001). Patients with low literacy skills were more likely to state that their physician was their sole source of HIV information (P < 0.005). Physicians may require training to appropriately convey health information to patients of low literacy.

AB OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of the use and impact of written drug information (WDI) on consumers, and to review the literature on the factors influencing the use of WDI by consumers.
   DATA SOURCES: Relevant articles published in English since the late 1970s were identified based on searches of on-line databases, texts, and cited references in published articles.
   STUDY SELECTION: Articles reporting findings on the origin, use, and impact of WDI were included. Due to limited literature, articles reporting findings on factors influencing the use of written drug as well as disease information were included.
   DATA EXTRACTION: Due to the lack of design consistency between studies and the comparatively small volume of work, subjective assessment rather than a criteria-based objective review was deemed more appropriate.
   DATA SYNTHESIS: To date, research on WDI has focused on its use and impact. WDI has the potential to increase patients' knowledge, compliance, and satisfaction. However, there is also the potential for anxiety or premature cessation of therapy due to fear of possible adverse effects. Multiple factors may potentially influence the use of WDI by consumers including those associated with the written information document (readability, presentation), the patient (health literacy, role of caregiver, demographic factors, health locus of control, coping style, health belief model), and the environment (timing of provision, experience).
   CONCLUSIONS: WDI has the potential to impact consumers positively and negatively. Although not widely investigated, a number of factors can potentially influence the use of WDI by consumers. The findings of this review can form the basis for much needed further research.

AB Poor governance has been identified as a barrier to effective integration of mental health care in low- and middle-income countries. Governance includes providing the necessary policy and legislative framework to promote and protect the mental health of a population, as well as health system design and quality assurance to ensure optimal policy implementation. The aim of this study was to identify key governance challenges, needs and potential strategies that could facilitate adequate integration of mental health into primary health care settings in low- and middle-income countries. Key informant qualitative interviews were held with 141 participants across six countries participating in the Emerging mental health systems in low- and middle-income countries (Emerald) research program: Ethiopia, India, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, and Uganda. Data were transcribed (and where necessary, translated into English) and analysed thematically using framework analysis, first at the country level, then synthesized at a cross-country level. While all the countries fared well with respect to strategic vision in the form of the development of national mental health policies, key governance strategies identified to address challenges included: strengthening capacity of managers at sub-national levels to develop and implement integrated plans; strengthening key aspects of the essential health system building blocks to promote responsiveness, efficiency and effectiveness; developing workable mechanisms for inter-sectoral collaboration, as well as community and service user engagement; and developing innovative approaches to improving mental health literacy and stigma reduction. Inadequate financing emerged as the biggest challenge for good governance. In addition to the need for overall good governance of a health care system, this study identifies a number of specific strategies to improve governance for integrated mental health care in low- and middle-income countries.

AB Andersen's Behavioral Model (ABM) provides a framework for understanding how patient and environmental factors impact health behaviors and outcomes. We compared patient-identified barriers/facilitators to retention in care and antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and evaluated how they mapped to ABM. Qualitative semi-structured interviews with 51 HIV-infected adults at HIV clinics in Philadelphia, PA, in 2013 were used to explore patients' experiences with HIV care and treatment. Interview data were analyzed for themes using a grounded theory approach. Among those interviewed, 53% were male and 88% were nonwhite; 49% were retained in care, 96% were on ART, and 57% were virally suppressed. Patients discussed 18 barriers/facilitators to retention in care and ART adherence: 11 common to both behaviors (stigma, mental illness, substance abuse, social support, reminder strategies, housing, insurance, symptoms, competing life activities, colocation of services, provider factors), 3 distinct to retention (transportation, clinic experiences, appointment scheduling), and 4 distinct to adherence (medication characteristics, pharmacy services, health literacy, health beliefs). Identified barriers/facilitators mapped to all ABM domains. These data support the use of ABM as a framework for classifying factors influencing HIV-specific health behaviors and have the potential to inform the design of interventions to improve retention in care and ART adherence.

AB ObjectivesThe objective was to determine whether patients with low health literacy have higher emergency department (ED) utilization and higher ED recidivism than patients with adequate health literacy.
   MethodsThe study was conducted at an urban academic ED with more than 95,000 annual visits that is part of a 13-hospital health system, using electronic records that are captured in a central data repository. As part of a larger, cross-sectional, convenience sample study, health literacy testing was performed using the short test of functional health literacy in adults (S-TOFHLA) and standard test thresholds identifying those with inadequate, marginal, and adequate health literacy. The authors collected patients' demographic and clinical data, including items known to affect recidivism. This was a structured electronic record review directed at determining 1) the median number of total ED visits in this health system within a 2-year period and 2) the proportion of patients with each level of health literacy who had return visits within 3, 7, and 14 days of index visits. Descriptive data for demographics and ED returns are reported, stratified by health literacy level. The Mantel-Haenszel chi-square was used to test whether there is an association between health literacy and ED recidivism. A negative binomial multivariable model was performed to examine whether health literacy affects ED use, including variables significant at the 0.1 alpha level on bivariate analysis and retaining those significant at an alpha of 0.05 in the final model.
   ResultsAmong 431 patients evaluated, 13.2% had inadequate, 10% had marginal, and 76.3% had adequate health literacy as identified by S-TOFHLA. Patients with inadequate health literacy had higher ED utilization compared to those with adequate health literacy (p = 0.03). Variables retained in the final model included S-TOFHLA score, number of medications, having a personal doctor, being a property owner, race, insurance, age, and simple comorbidity score. During the study period, 118 unique patients each made at least one return ED visit within a 14-day period. The proportion of patients with inadequate health literacy making at least one return visit was higher than that of patients with adequate health literacy at 14 days, but was not significantly higher within 3 or 7 days.
   ConclusionsIn this single-center study, higher utilization of the ED by patients with inadequate health literacy when compared to those with adequate health literacy was observed. Patients with inadequate health literacy made a higher number of return visits at 14 days but not at 3 or 7 days.
   Resumen
   ObjetivosDeterminar si los pacientes con una educacion sanitaria baja tienen un mayor uso y frecuentacion al servicio de urgencias (SU) que los pacientes con una educacion sanitaria adecuada.
   MetodologiaEste estudio se llevo a cabo en un SU urbano y universitario con mas de 95.000 visitas al ano que forma parte de un sistema sanitario de 13 hospitales, mediante la revision de historias clinicas electronicas que son capturadas en un repositorio de datos central. Como parte de un gran estudio transversal de muestra de conveniencia, se realizaron pruebas de educacion sanitaria mediante el Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA) y los umbrales de la prueba estandar identificaron aquellos con educacion sanitaria inadecuada, marginal y adecuada. Los autores recogieron datos demograficos y clinicos de los pacientes, que incluian variables conocidas para el impacto de la refrecuentacion. Se realizo una revision de historia clinica electronica estructurada dirigida para determinar: 1) la mediana de numero de visitas totales al SU en este sistema sanitario en un periodo de 2 anos, y 2) la proporcion de pacientes en cada nivel de educacion sanitaria que revisitan a los 3, 7 y 14 dias de la visita indice. Se documentaron los datos descriptivos para la demografia y las revisitas al SU estratificados por el nivel de educacion sanitaria. Se uso el test de la ji cuadrado de Mantel-Haenszel para analizar si habia una asociacion entre la educacion sanitaria y la refrecuentacion al SU. Un modelo multivariable binomial negativo se utilizo para examinar si la educacion sanitaria impacta en el uso del SU, el cual incluia las variables significativas con nivel de alfa de 0,1 en el analisis univariable, y permanecieron aquellas con nivel de alfa de 0,05 en el modelo final.
   ResultadosDe los 431 pacientes evaluados, 13,2% tuvieron una educacion sanitaria inadecuada, 10% marginal y 76,3% adecuada segun el S-TOFHLA. Los pacientes con educacion sanitaria inadecuada tuvieron mayor uso del SU en comparacion con aquellos con educacion sanitaria adecuada (p = 0,03). Las variables que permanecieron en el modelo final incluyeron la puntuacion del S-TOFHLA, el numero de medicaciones, el tener un medico personal, el ser propietario, la raza, el seguro, la edad y la puntuacion de la comorbilidad simple. Durante el periodo del estudio, unicamente 118 pacientes hicieron al menos una revisita al SU en el periodo de 14 dias. La frecuencia de pacientes con educacion sanitaria inadecuada que hizo al menos una revisita fue mayor que en aquellos pacientes con educacion sanitaria adecuada a los 14 dias, pero no fue significativamente mayor entre los primeros 3 o 7 dias.
   ConclusionesEn este estudio de un unico centro, se observo una mayor utilizacion del SU por los pacientes con educacion sanitaria inadecuada cuando se comparo con aquellos con educacion sanitaria adecuada. Los pacientes con educacion sanitaria inadecuada hicieron un mayor numero de revisitas a los 14 dias, pero no a los 3 ni a los 7 dias.

TI Health Literacy Practices and Educational Competencies for Health
   Professionals: A Consensus Study
SO JOURNAL OF HEALTH COMMUNICATION
LA English
DT Article
ID COMMUNICATION; PHYSICIANS; LANGUAGE; NURSES
AB Health care professionals often lack adequate knowledge about health literacy and the skills needed to address low health literacy among patients and their caregivers. Many promising practices for mitigating the effects of low health literacy are not used consistently. Improving health literacy training for health care professionals has received increasing emphasis in recent years. The development and evaluation of curricula for health professionals has been limited by the lack of agreed-upon educational competencies in this area. This study aimed to identify a set of health literacy educational competencies and target behaviors, or practices, relevant to the training of all health care professionals. The authors conducted a thorough literature review to identify a comprehensive list of potential health literacy competencies and practices, which they categorized into 1 or more educational domains (i.e., knowledge, skills, attitudes) or a practice domain. The authors stated each item in operationalized language following Bloom's Taxonomy. The authors then used a modified Delphi method to identify consensus among a group of 23 health professions education experts representing 11 fields in the health professions. Participants rated their level of agreement as to whether a competency or practice was both appropriate and important for all health professions students. A predetermined threshold of 70% agreement was used to define consensus. After 4 rounds of ratings and modifications, consensus agreement was reached on 62 out of 64 potential educational competencies (24 knowledge items, 27 skill items, and 11 attitude items), and 32 out of 33 potential practices. This study is the first known attempt to develop consensus on a list of health literacy practices and to translate recommended health literacy practices into an agreed-upon set of measurable educational competencies for health professionals. Further work is needed to prioritize the competencies and practices in terms of relative importance.

TI Associations of Health Literacy With Dialysis Adherence and Health
   Resource Utilization in Patients Receiving Maintenance Hemodialysis

AB Background: Although limited health literacy is common in hemodialysis patients, its effects on clinical outcomes are not well understood.
   Study Design: Observational study.
   Setting & Participants: 260 maintenance hemodialysis patients enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of symptom management strategies from January 2009 through April 2011.
   Predictor: Limited health literacy.
   Outcomes: Dialysis adherence (missed and abbreviated treatments) and health resource utilization (emergency department visits and end-stage renal disease [ESRD]-related hospitalizations).
   Measurements: We assessed health literacy using the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) and used negative binomial regression to analyze the independent associations of limited health literacy with dialysis adherence and health resource utilization over 12-24 months.
   Results: 41 of 260 (16%) patients showed limited health literacy (REALM score, <= 60). There were 1,152 missed treatments, 5,127 abbreviated treatments, 552 emergency department visits, and 463 ESRD-related hospitalizations. Limited health literacy was associated independently with an increased incidence of missed dialysis treatments (missed, 0.6% vs 0.3%; adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.14; 95% CI, 1.10-4.17), emergency department visits (annual visits, 1.7 vs 1.0; adjusted IRR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.01-1.86), and hospitalizations related to ESRD (annual hospitalizations, 0.9 vs 0.5; adjusted IRR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.03-2.34).
   Limitations: Generalizability and potential for residual confounding.
   Conclusions: Patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis who have limited health literacy are more likely to miss dialysis treatments, use emergency care, and be hospitalized related to their kidney disease. These findings have important clinical practice and cost implications. Am J Kidney Dis. 62(1):73-80. (C) 2013 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives/Hypothesis: Deficient health literacy remains a widespread public issue. As such, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommends that all patient resources should be written around a sixth-grade level. The authors evaluate healthcare-oriented resources specified for patient use on the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (AAFPRS) Web site in order to identify potential areas of improvement and highlight those sections that may serve as paradigms for future revisions. Study Design: Descriptive and correlational design. Methods: Seventeen healthcare-oriented resources specifically for patients were downloaded in February 2012 from the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Web site. Readability assessments of each article were performed using Readability Studio Professional Edition Version 2012.1. These tests included the Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, SMOG Grading, Coleman-Liau Index, Gunning-Fog Index, the New Fog Count, the New Dale-Chall Readability Formula, FORCAST formula, Raygor Readability Estimate, and the Fry Graph. Results: Patient health education material found on the AAFPRS Web site has been found to be written at an average grade level of 12th grade using 10 different readability scales. Conclusions: Modifications of the patient education section of the AAFPRS Web site can increase the readability of the literature, and allow greater comprehension among a wider audience.

AB Objective: Study impact of health literacy on educational intervention for patients "Living with Coronary Artery Disease."
   Methods: 187 patients were randomized to: VHS/DVD plus printed booklet; or booklet alone prior to scheduled visit. Main outcome measures included CAD knowledge assessment, clinical outcomes (weigh and blood pressure) and health behaviors (diet, exercise, and smoking); while functional health literacy was assessed as a possible predictor variable.
   Results: Knowledge scores and health behaviors improved following both interventions. Those receiving the booklet and video also had a significant improvement in exercise, and weight loss. There was a trend (p = 0.07) towards greater improvement in test scores among those receiving the booklet plus video. Patients with lower health literacy benefited as much as higher literacy patients.
   Conclusions: Incorporation of an educational program into clinical visits for patients with chronic disease improved disease-specific knowledge and prompted patients to become activated and involved in their care, improving health behaviors and outcomes. Lower health literacy was not a barrier to this beneficial effect.
   Practice implications: Patients with lower health literacy may also benefit from educational, shared decision-making interventions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: In this randomized, controlled, unblinded trial, we sought to test Repeat Back's (RB) effect on comprehension following informed consent discussions.
   Summary Background Data: RB has been suggested as a method to improve patient comprehension when obtaining informed consent. In this technique, patients are asked to recount what they have been told in the informed consent discussion. Despite preliminary data, this practice has not been evaluated in any large scale study.
   Methods: This study was conducted in 7 Veterans Health Administration Medical Centers where informed consent is obtained using iMedConsent, the VA's computer based platform. Patients scheduled for elective surgeries were randomized to RB (a module added to the iMedConsent package) or standard iMedConsent (no RB). Comprehension was tested after the informed consent using procedure-specific questionnaires. Time stamps in the iMedConsent program estimated the time spent completing the informed consent process. Provider and patient satisfaction were measured using 5-point Likert scales. Statistical comparisons of groups were performed using t-tests and chi(2) tests.
   Results: A total of 575 patients were enrolled. In the RB group, providers spent 2.6 minutes longer (P < 0.0001) obtaining informed consent. The mean comprehension score was significantly higher in the RB group (71.4%) versus the no RB group (68.2%, P = 0.03); the effect was greatest in carotid endarterectomy patients (RB = 73.4% vs. no RB = 67.7%, P = 0.02). Quality of decision making was rated similarly. Providers were neutral to slightly favorable regarding RB.
   Conclusions: RB implemented within an electronic informed consent system improved patient comprehension. The additional time required was acceptable to providers. RB should be considered as an enhancement to surgical informed consent.

TI Perception of Barriers to Self-care Management Among Diabetic Patients
SO DIABETES EDUCATOR
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH LITERACY; CHRONIC DISEASE; EDUCATION; KNOWLEDGE
AB Purpose
   The purpose of this study was to explore individual, educational, and system barriers that limit low-income diabetes patients' ability to achieve optimal diabetes self-management.
   Methods
   Economically disadvantaged patients with diabetes who used the Diabetes Clinic of Grady Health System in Atlanta, Georgia, participated in 3 focus group discussions.
   Results
   The discussions were held with mostly African Americans (n = 35) to explore barriers to achieving optimal diabetes self-management. Most participants were not married, approximately one-third had less than high school level reading skills, and 40% were not currently working. In terms of individual barriers, the emotional toll from the diagnosis of and lifestyle changes to treat diabetes was a recurrent theme, and included stress, frustration, social isolation, interpersonal conflicts, depression, and fear. Denial was often mentioned as the key factor that inhibited adherence to a healthy mode of living. The educational barriers were failure to recognize the risks and consequences of an asymptomatic condition. Many participants did not understand A1C. Finally, several system barriers were identified. The participants identified needed services, including follow-up and refresher courses, support group discussions, nutrition and medication education, availability of different education modalities, and expanded clinic hours.
   Conclusions
   The focus group discussions identified both barriers to diabetes management and opportunities for improving care for underserved patients with diabetes. The results are useful to improve the delivery of care and to develop quantitative studies to explore particular areas of interest. Based on these results, the current system needs to provide more support and education to patients with diabetes.

TI Designing e-Health Interventions for Low-Health-Literate Culturally
   Diverse Parents: Addressing the Obesity Epidemic
SO TELEMEDICINE JOURNAL AND E-HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE telehealth; e-health; obesity; low-literate parents
ID LOW-INCOME WOMEN; NUTRITION EDUCATION
AB Child and adolescent obesity is a significant problem contributing to long-term trends in adult obesity. Educating parents about strategies for raising healthy children is complicated by the problem of low health literacy. E-health provides new opportunities to educate low-health-literate audiences, and this project was intended as formative research to guide design of interventions for low-health-literate parents. Focus groups were conducted with African American, Hispanic, and white parents (n = 43), 18 years of age or older, and at or below median income for the region. Each focus group included the following: a discussion of parents' general use of the Internet for health information, the demonstration of a Web site designed specifically for low-health-literate users, and asking participants about ideas under consideration for future interventions. Participants use search engines to look for health information and use heuristics, such as position in search results, to evaluate Web site quality. Some participants avoid information from .edu and .gov domains due to perceived complexity, and there was an almost-universal lack of trust in the government for health information. University researchers, by contrast, were trusted sources as information providers. Content and usability that meet the needs of extremely low-literate audiences may be perceived as slow and lacking depth by more literate and Internet-savvy users. E-health can be used to educate low-health-literate audiences, but interventions designed for these users must be layered in terms of content and usability to meet varying levels of functional and media literacy.

TI Health literacy skills of kidney transplant recipients
SO PROGRESS IN TRANSPLANTATION
LA English
DT Article
ID PATIENT EDUCATION; ADULT LITERACY; KNOWLEDGE; MORTALITY; DISEASE;
   BARRIER; STAGE; RISK
AB Context-Although low health literacy can affect patients' treatment decision making, comprehension of health information, and medication adherence, little is known about health literacy skills of kidney transplant recipients.
   Objective-To examine the relationship among kidney transplant recipients' health literacy levels, transplant knowledge, and graft function.
   Design-Cross-sectional study of 124 adult kidney transplant recipients.
   Main Outcome Measures-Health literacy was assessed via the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA) and the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine-Transplantation (REALM-T). Data on recipients' transplant numeracy, knowledge needs, and demographics were collected via semistructured interviews. Multivariable linear regressions were used to assess the relationship between health literacy and graft function.
   Results-Most kidney recipients (91 %) had adequate health literacy (S-TOFHLA); however, 81 % were unfamiliar with at least I kidney transplant-related term (REALM-T). The 5 least familiar terms were sensitization (50%), urethra (45%), trough level (41 %), blood urea nitrogen (32%), and toxicity (3 1 %). Numeracy levels varied: 2 1 % knew the likelihood of 1-year graft survival; 29% knew that half of kidney recipients have problems with the transplant in the first 6 months; 68% were aware of the risk of death within the first year after transplantation; and 86% knew the normal range for creatinine in kidney recipients. Patients with lower health literacy (REALM-T) had higher creatinine levels.
   Conclusions-Transplant providers should intervene with better patient education materials to improve patients' health literacy, which may improve patients' medication adherence or transplant outcomes. (Progress in Transplantation. 2009; 19:25-34)

AB This cross-sectional survey explored the association between functional health literacy and knowledge of, beliefs and attitudes about, and reported usage of colorectal cancer screening tests. The results indicate that functional health literacy, as assessed by the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (STOFHLA), is not an independent predictor of colorectal cancer screening knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, or behavior. Latino ethnicity and education, however, often predicted screening responses, suggesting that efforts to improve communication about colorectal cancer screening with Latino patients and patients with low education clearly are needed to reduce the disparities in awareness and utilization of colorectal cancer screening tests. This study also explored influences on intended screening behavior. Physician recommendation was found to be a powerful motivator of intention to undergo colorectal cancer screening regardless of literacy level, indicating that interventions aimed at increasing physician recommendation of colorectal cancer screening may be an effective way of increasing screening rates.

AB Purpose: We investigated whether patient-centered instructions for chronic heart failure medications increase comprehension and memory for medication information in older adults diagnosed with chronic heart failure. Design and Methods: Patient-centered instructions for familiar and unfamiliar medications were compared with instructions for the same medications from a chain pharmacy (standard pharmacy instructions). Thirty-two adults (age, M = 63.8) read and answered questions about each instruction, recalled medication information (free recall), and then answered questions from memory (cued recall). Results: Patient-centered instructions were better recalled and understood more quickly than the standard instructions. Instructions for the familiar medications also were better recalled. Patient-centered instructions were understood more accurately for the unfamiliar medications, but standard instructions were understood more accurately for the familiar medications. However, the recall measures showed that the advantage of the standard format for familiar medications was short lived. lmplications: The findings suggest that the patient-centered format may improve printed medication instructions available in many pharmacies, which should help older adults to better understand how to take their medications.

AB Background. -Health literacy measures the degree to which individuals understand health information. It has not been studied among parents with limited English proficiency (LEP).
   Objective.-We aimed to determine how well Spanish-speaking Latino parents with LEP understood the written instructions accompanying a routinely prescribed medication.
   Design and Methods.-We conducted a cross-sectional survey of parents of young children. We showed subjects a medicine bottle with an English prescription label and a Spanish drug information sheet (DIS). Subjects demonstrated how much medicine they would give and stated how often they would give it (Medication Dosing). Then they answered 5 questions regarding information from the DIS (DIS comprehension). We coded responses dichotomously as correct or incorrect. We compared Medication Dosing and DIS comprehension by age, comfort with speaking English, birthplace, number of years in the United States, and education. Regression analyses were performed to adjust for these potential confounders.
   Results.-Of 100 participants, 22 % correctly dosed the medication; 29 % correctly answered all questions regarding the Spanish DIS. Of subjects comfortable speaking English, 50 % correctly demonstrated the amount of medicine to give. Overall, higher education and comfort speaking English were associated with better Medication Dosing. Higher education and birth in South America were associated with better DIS comprehension.
   Conclusions. -Few parents with LEP were able to understand routinely dispensed written medication instructions. Pediatricians should not assume that Spanish-speaking Latino parents who are comfortable speaking English will understand a prescription label written in English, or that Latino parents who speak Spanish will understand drug information written in Spanish.

AB This article provides a more differentiated understanding of mobile health consumers, and considers whether health app use may contribute to new digital inequalities. It focuses on factors associated with mobile health app use, and identifies which factors explain the use of different types of health apps. Data from a large representative sample of the Dutch population (N = 1,079) show that mobile health app users were generally younger, higher educated, and had higher levels of e-health literacy skills than non-users. Interestingly, different usage patterns were found for specific types of health apps. Theory and policy implications are discussed.

AB Objective: With the rapid rise in the adoption of patient portals, many patients are gaining access to their personal health information online for the first time. The objective of this study was to examine specific usability barriers to patient portal engagement among a diverse group of patients and caregivers.
   Materials and Methods: We conducted interviews using performance testing and think-aloud methods with 23 patients and 2 caregivers as they first attempted to use features of a newly launched patient portal.
   Results: In navigating the portal, participants experienced basic computer barriers (eg, difficulty using a mouse), routine computer barriers (eg, mistyping, navigation issues), reading/writing barriers, and medical content barriers. Compared to participants with adequate health literacy, participants with limited health literacy required 2 additional minutes to complete each task and were more likely to experience each type of navigational barrier. They also experienced more inaccuracies in interpreting a test result and finding a treatment plan within an after-visit summary.
   Discussion: When using a patient portal for the first time, participants with limited health literacy completed fewer tasks unassisted, had a higher prevalence of encountering barriers, took longer to complete tasks, and had more problems accurately interpreting medical information.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest a strong need for tailored and accessible training and support to assist all vulnerable patients and/or caregivers with portal registration and use. Measuring the health literacy of a patient population might serve as a strong proxy for identifying patients who need the most support in using health technologies.

AB The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a new comprehensive patient-reported measure of treatment burden-the Patient Experience with Treatment and Self-management (PETS).
   A conceptual framework was used to derive the PETS with items reviewed and cognitively tested with patients. A survey battery, including a pilot version of the PETS, was mailed to 838 multi-morbid patients from two healthcare institutions for validation.
   A total of 332 multi-morbid patients returned completed surveys. Diagnostics supported deletion and consolidation of some items and domains. Confirmatory factor analysis supported a domain model for scaling comprised of 9 factors: medical information, medications, medical appointments, monitoring health, interpersonal challenges, medical/healthcare expenses, difficulty with healthcare services, role/social activity limitations, and physical/mental exhaustion. Scales showed good internal consistency (alpha range 0.79-0.95). Higher PETS scores, indicative of greater treatment burden, were correlated with more distress, less satisfaction with medications, lower self-efficacy, worse physical and mental health, and lower convenience of healthcare (Ps < 0.001). Patients with lower health literacy, less adherence to medications, and more financial difficulties reported higher PETS scores (Ps < 0.01).
   A comprehensive patient-reported measure of treatment burden can help to better characterize the impact of treatment and self-management burden on patient well-being and guide care toward minimally disruptive medicine.

   population; Age groups; Survey; HLS-EU-Q

AB Background: Health literacy is of increasing importance in public health research. It is a necessary pre-condition for the involvement in decisions about health and health care and related to health outcomes. Knowledge about limited health literacy in different age groups is crucial to better target public health interventions for subgroups of the population. However, little is known about health literacy in Germany. The study therefore assesses the prevalence of limited health literacy and associated factors among different age groups.
   Methods: The Health Literacy Survey Germany is a cross-sectional study with 2,000 participants aged 15 years or older in private households. Perceived health literacy was assessed via computer-assisted personal interviews using the HLS-EU-Q-47 questionnaire. Descriptive analyses, chi-square tests and odds ratios were performed stratified for different age groups.
   Results: The population affected by limited perceived health literacy increases by age. Of the respondents aged 15-29 years, 47.3 % had limited perceived health literacy and 47.2 % of those aged 30-45 years, whereas 55.2 % of the respondents aged 46-64 years and 66.4 % aged 65 years and older showed limited perceived health literacy. In all age groups, limited perceived health literacy was associated with limited functional health literacy, low social status, and a high frequency of doctor visits.
   Conclusions: The results suggest a need to further investigate perceived health literacy in all phases of the life-course. Particular attention should be devoted to persons with lower social status, limited functional health literacy and/or a high number of doctor visits in all age groups.

AB Background: Despite excessive consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), little is known about behavioral interventions to reduce SSB intake among adults, particularly in medically-underserved rural communities. This type 1 effectiveness-implementation hybrid RCT, conducted in 2012-2014, applied the RE-AIM framework and was designed to assess the effectiveness of a behavioral intervention targeting SSB consumption (SIPsmartER) when compared to an intervention targeting physical activity (MoveMore) and to determine if health literacy influenced retention, engagement or outcomes.
   Methods: Guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior and health literacy strategies, the 6 month multi-component intervention for both conditions included three small-group classes, one live teach-back call, and 11 interactive voice response calls. Validated measures were used to assess SSB consumption (primary outcome) and all secondary outcomes including physical activity behaviors, theory-based constructs, quality of life, media literacy, anthropometric, and biological outcomes.
   Results: Targeting a medically-underserved rural region in southwest Virginia, 1056 adult participants were screened, 620 (59 %) eligible, 301 (49 %) enrolled and randomized, and 296 included in these 2015 analyses. Participants were 93 % Caucasian, 81 % female, 31 % <= high-school educated, 43 % < $ 14,999 household income, and 33 % low health literate. Retention rates (74 %) and program engagement was not statistically different between conditions. Compared to MoveMore, SIPsmartER participants significantly decreased SSB kcals and BMI at 6 months. SIPsmartER participants significantly decreased SSB intake by 227 (95 % CI = -326,-127, p < 0.001) kcals/day from baseline to 6 months when compared to the decrease of 53 (95 % CI = -88,-17, p < 0.01) kcals/day among MoveMore participants (p < 0.001). SIPsmartER participants decreased BMI by 0.21 (95 % CI = -0.35,-0.06; p < 0.01) kg/m(2) from baseline to 6 months when compared to the non-significant 0.10 (95 % CI = -0.23, 0.43; NS) kg/m(2) gain among MoveMore participants (p < 0.05). Significant 0-6 month effects were observed for about half of the theory-based constructs, but for no biological outcomes. Health literacy status did not influence retention rates, engagement or outcomes.
   Conclusions: SIPsmartER is an effective intervention to decrease SSB consumption among adults and is promising for translation into practice settings. SIPsmartER also yielded small, yet significant, improvements in BMI. By using health literacy-focused strategies, the intervention was robust in achieving reductions for participants of varying health literacy status.

AB Purpose: Understanding why nearly 80% of youth ages 6-18 years with a mental disorder fail to receive treatment represents an important public health priority. International data suggest that underrecognition of mental illness and the need for treatment are barriers to service utilization. This study extends work to a U.S. sample of 1,104 adolescents.
   Methods: High School students were invited to participate in a self-report study assessing knowledge and beliefs regarding mental illness. Participants completed the survey in groups at school and read vignettes portraying peers experiencing major depression, social anxiety disorder, and a situation where the individual has to cope with a common life stressor followed by a series of questions in reference to each vignette.
   Results: Adolescents had better recognition of depression than social anxiety disorder and were more likely to recommend seeking help for it. However, <50% of youth recognized depression. Family, friends, and counselors were recommended as sources of help. Differences according to the sex of the respondent and person in the vignette were observed.
   Conclusions: These data are among the first to provide information regarding the mental health literacy of American adolescents and suggest potential points for intervention. Pending replication of the findings herein, efforts to help adolescents recognize mental health problems and to increase the likelihood of recommending professional help will be important.

ID HEALTH LITERACY
AB Currently, vast amounts of health information and health management tools are available to the public online. To maximize the benefits of these e-health technologies, it is important to assess the e-health literacy of individuals. The eHealth Literacy Scale has been used widely in the past several years, but mainly in younger populations. The purpose of this study was to test the psychometric aspects of the eHealth Literacy Scale for older adults using a secondary data analysis (N = 866; mean age, 62.8 +/- 8.5 years). Reliability of the eHealth Literacy Scale was examined by calculating alpha coefficients and conducting test-retest procedures. Its validity was assessed using exploratory factor analysis and the hypothesis testing procedure. Findings demonstrated that eHealth Literacy Scale was internally consistent (alpha = .94) and stable (t(244) = -1.48, P = .140). The exploratory factor analysis yielded a single factor structure explaining 67.3% of the variance. The hypothesis testing also supported the validity of eHealth Literacy Scale. In recent years, there have been great efforts to use e-health interventions to engage patients in healthcare and to help them manage their own health. Our study suggests that the eHealth Literacy Scale, a short screening tool for e-health literacy, can be successfully used for older adults.

TI Nurse Overestimation of Patients' Health Literacy
SO JOURNAL OF HEALTH COMMUNICATION
LA English
DT Article
ID IDENTIFY PATIENTS; CARE
AB Patient education and effective communication are core elements of the nursing profession; therefore, awareness of a patient's health literacy is integral to patient care, safety, education, and counseling. Several past studies have suggested that health care providers overestimate their patient's health literacy. In this study, the authors compare inpatient nurses' estimate of their patient's health literacy to the patient's health literacy using Newest Vital Sign as the health literacy measurement. A total of 65 patients and 30 nurses were enrolled in this trial. The results demonstrate that nurses incorrectly identify patients with low health literacy. In addition, overestimates outnumber underestimates 6 to 1. The results reinforce previous evidence that health care providers overestimate a patient's health literacy. The overestimation of a patient's health literacy by nursing personnel may contribute to the widespread problem of poor health outcomes and hospital readmission rates.

AB Objective. Racial/ethnic disparities have been well documented in asthma. While socioeconomic status (SES) has been repeatedly implicated as a root cause, the role of limited health literacy has not been extensively studied. The purpose of this study was to examine the independent contributions of SES and health literacy in explaining asthma disparities. Methods. A cohort study was conducted in a Chicago-based sample of 353 adults aged 18-40 years with persistent asthma from 2004 to 2007. Health literacy, SES, and asthma outcomes including disease control, quality of life, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations were assessed in person at baseline, and asthma outcomes were measured every 3 months for 2 years by phone. Multivariate models were used to assess racial/ethnic disparities in asthma outcomes and the effect of health literacy and SES on these estimates. Results. Compared with White participants, African American adults fared significantly worse in all asthma outcomes (p < .05) and Latino participants had lower quality of life (beta = -0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.79, -0.14; p = 01) and worse asthma control (risk ratio [RR] = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.41, 0.98; p = .04). Differences in SES partially explained these disparities. Health literacy explained an additional 20.2% of differences in quality of life between Latinos and Whites, but differences in hospitalization rates between African American and White adults remained (RR = 2.97; 95% CI = 1.09, 8.12, p = .03). Conclusions. Health literacy appears to be an overlooked factor explaining racial and ethnic disparities in asthma. Evidence-based low literacy strategies for patient education and counseling should be included in comprehensive interventions.

AB The extent to which treatment recommendations in the orthopedic setting contribute to well-established racial disparities in the utilization of total joint replacement (TJR) in the treatment of advanced knee/hip osteoarthritis has not been explored.
   To examine whether orthopedic surgeons are less likely to recommend TJR to African-American patients compared to white patients with similar clinical indications, and whether there are racial differences in the receipt of TJR within six months of study enrollment.
   Prospective, observational study.
   African-American (AA; n = 120) and white (n = 337) patients seeking treatment for knee or hip osteoarthritis in Veterans Affairs orthopedic clinics.
   Patients completed surveys that assessed socio-demographic and clinical variables that could influence osteoarthritis treatment. Orthopedic surgeons' notes were reviewed to determine whether patients had been recommended for TJR and whether they underwent the procedure within 6 months of study enrollment.
   Rate of TJR recommendation was 19.5%. Odds of receiving a TJR recommendation were lower for AA than white patients of similar age and disease severity (OR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.26-0.83; P = 0.01). However, this difference was not significant after adjusting for patient preference for TJR (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.36-1.31, P = 0.25). Overall, 10.3% of patients underwent TJR within 6 months. TJR was less likely for AA patients than for white patients of similar age and disease severity (OR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.16-1.05, P = 0.06), but this difference was reduced after adjusting for whether patients had received a recommendation for the procedure at the index visit (OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.21-1.54, P = 0.27).
   In this study, race differences in patient preferences for TJR appeared to underlie race differences in TJR recommendations, which led to race differences in utilization of the procedure. Our findings suggest that patient treatment preferences play an important role in racial disparities in TJR utilization in the orthopedic setting.

AB Patient activation refers to people's ability to engage in self-management of their health and health care. We assessed the performance of the Patient Activation Measure (PAM) for patients attending three inner-city health centers and compared resultant scores with those of the general U.S. adult population. We approached 801 patients and 527 (65.8%) participated; the majority were Latino(a) or African American/Black. No differences in activation were seen according to age. Males and more educated patients were more activated (p<.05) and patients with better self-rated health and adequate health literacy were more activated than their counterparts (p<.001). Patterns of scores resembled those of the U.S. general population for educational attainment and self-rated health but not for gender and age. Compared with the general population, more patients were characterized as level 1 (least activated). Developing strategies that enhance patient activation is critical to improving health outcomes, particularly in less advantaged populations.

AB Participants: one hundred fifty consecutive inpatients with mental co-morbidities hospitalised for acute medical illness (mean age 80 +/- 9, 70% of women) were considered for the study.
   Measurements: IP and PO were prospectively indentified according to STOPP/START criteria at hospital admission.
   Results: over 95% were taking >= 1 medication (median = 7) which amounted to 1,137 prescriptions. The prevalence of IP was 77% and PO was 65%. The most frequent encountered IP concerned drugs adversely affecting fallers (25%) and antiaggregants therapy without atherosclerosis (14%). PO concerned antidepressants with moderate/severe depression (20%) and calcium-vitamin D supplementation (18%). Independent predictors for IP were increased number of concomitant drugs (odds ratio [OR] 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-1.89), being cognitively impaired (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.55-2.24), and having fallen in the preceding 3 months (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.52-2.61) or hospitalised in the preceding year (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.23). Concerning PO, psychiatric disorder (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.42-2.01) and increase level of co-morbidities (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.48-1.99) were identified. Living in an institutional setting was a predictive maker for both IP (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.27-1.74) and PO (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.32-1.91).
   Conclusion: IP and PO were highly prevalent raising the need of a greater health literacy concerning geriatric conditions in non-geriatrician practitioners who care elderly as well as in the community, in hospital and institutional settings for improving quality and safety in prescribing medication.

AB Objectives: It has been shown that socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with adherence to treatment of patients with several chronic diseases. However, there is a controversy regarding the impact of SES on adherence among patients with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Thus, we sought to perform a systematic review of the evidence regarding the association of SES with adherence to treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS.
   Methods: We searched the PubMed database to identify studies concerning SES and HIV/AIDS and collected data regarding the association between various determinants of SES (income, education, occupation) and adherence.
   Findings: We initially identified 116 potentially relevant articles and reviewed in detail 17 original studies, which contained data that were helpful in evaluating the association between SES and adherence to treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS. No original research study has specifically focused on the possible association between SES and adherence to treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS. Among the reviewed studies that examined the impact of income and education on adherence to antiretroviral treatment, only half and less than a third, respectively, found a statistically significant association between these main determinants of SES and adherence of patients infected with HIV/AIDS.
   Conclusion: Our systematic review of the available evidence does not provide conclusive support for existence of a clear association between SES and adherence among patients infected with HIV/ AIDS. There seemed to be a positive trend among components of SES (income, education, occupation) and adherence to antiretroviral treatment in many of the reviewed studies, however most of the studies did not establish a statistically significant association between determinants of SES and adherence.

TI Literacy, race, and PSA level among low-income men newly diagnosed with
   prostate cancer
SO UROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH LITERACY; AFRICAN-AMERICAN; ANTIGEN LEVELS; KNOWLEDGE; TIME;
   ASSOCIATION; BELIEFS
AB Objectives. Among men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels are higher and the cancer stage more advanced for African Americans than for whites. An earlier study found that after adjustment for literacy, race was no longer a significant predictor of advanced stage at presentation. We investigated whether, after adjusting for literacy, race was a significant independent predictor of greater PSA levels among men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer.
   Methods. Consecutive patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer from four outpatient care facilities in Chicago were interviewed and given a literacy assessment (n = 308). The PSA level at diagnosis was obtained from the medical charts. Logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of high PSA levels (greater than 20 ng/mL) at presentation.
   Results. Africa n-American men were three times more likely to have low literacy skills (sixth grade or less: 22.9% versus 7.1 %; P < 0.001) than were white men. In turn, men with low literacy skills were more than twice as likely to have a PSA level greater than 20 ng/mL at diagnosis (33.3% versus 13.5%; P = 0.009). On multivariate analyses, significant predictors of high PSA levels included low literacy (adjusted odds ratio 2.5, 95% confidence interval 1.5 to 4.2) and older age (age 65 to 74 years, adjusted odds ratio 2.6, 95% confidence interval 2.1 to 3.1 versus older than 74 years, adjusted odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.8 to 6.6), but not African-American race.
   Conclusions. In the current era in which PSA testing is common, low literacy may be an important and potentially overlooked factor associated with higher PSA levels at prostate cancer diagnosis among African-American and white men.

AB Background Little is known about the perception of mental disorders and stigma in developing countries. The aim of this study was to review the literature on popular perception of mental disorders in Latin America and the Caribbean. Methods Electronic search was made on Medline and Lilacs for original articles published from January 1980 to December 2001, using "public attitudes" and "mental disorders" as key words on Medline and "attitudes about health" as well as "stigma" as key words on Lilacs. In addition, a manual search was conducted in the references of the articles obtained in the electronic search and in area periodicals. Results The search produced 871 articles, ten of which fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Attitudes in relation to the mentally ill are predominantly positive, especially among individuals with a higher educational or socioeconomic level. Schizophrenia is the condition most often identified as mental illness and considered the most serious affliction. Depression and alcoholism are identified as mental illnesses by a smaller portion of the population. The community mostly recommends treatment with health professionals. Conclusion In Latin America and the Caribbean, there is a tendency to share the beliefs of the western medical model and few signs of the presence of elements from traditional medicine or religion. However, the studies exhibited various methodological gaps and problems. New studies, using more appropriate methodology, should be carried out in this region.

AB This consensus statement is the product of an international Think Tank on the initiative of the International Society of Sport Psychology. The purpose of the Think Tank was to unify major sport psychology organizations in a discussion of the current status and future challenges of applied and research aspects of athlete mental health. The contributors present six propositions and recommendations to inspire sport organizations and researchers. The propositions are: Mental health is a core component of a culture of excellence; Mental health in a sport context should be better defined; Research on mental health in sport should broaden the scope of assessment; Athlete mental health is a major resource for the whole athletic career and life post-athletic career; The environment can nourish or malnourish athlete mental health; and Mental health is everybody's business but should be overseen by one or a few specified members. It is recommended that researchers unite to develop a more contextualized definition of athlete mental health and more comprehensive strategies of assessment, as well as join forces with sporting organizations to investigate sustainable elite sport environments and the role of the mental health officer. Sport organizations are advised to recognize athlete mental health as a core component of a healthy elite sport system and a key indicator of their effectiveness, support research initiatives, and to promote the mental health literacy of all their staff while engaging a mental health officer with the responsibility to oversee a support system.

AB Aims. The current study aimed to: (i) describe the extent of overall stigma as well as the differences in stigma towards people with alcohol abuse, dementia, depression, schizophrenia and obsessive compulsive disorder, as well as (ii) establish the dimensions of stigma and examine its correlates, in the general population of Singapore, using a vignette approach.
   Methods. Data for the current study came from a larger nation-wide cross-sectional study of mental health literacy conducted in Singapore. The study population comprised Singapore Residents (Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents) aged 18-65 years who were living in Singapore at the time of the survey. All respondents were administered the Personal and Perceived scales of the Depression Stigma scale and the Social Distance scale to measure personal stigma and social distance, respectively. Weighted mean and standard error of the mean were calculated for continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Exploratory structural equation modelling and confirmatory factor analysis were used to establish the dimensions of stigma. Multivariable linear regressions were conducted to examine factors associated with each of the stigma scale scores.
   Results. The mean age of the respondents was 40.9 years and gender was equally represented (50.9% were males). The findings from the factor analysis revealed that personal stigma formed two distinct dimensions comprising 'weak-not-sick' and 'dangerous/unpredictable' while social distance stigma items loaded strongly into a single factor. Those of Malay and Indian ethnicity, lower education, lower income status and those who were administered the depression and alcohol abuse vignette were significantly associated with higher weak-not-sick scores. Those of Indian ethnicity, 6 years of education and below, lower income status and those who were administered the alcohol abuse vignette were significantly associated with higher dangerous/unpredictable scores. Those administered the alcohol abuse vignette were associated with higher social distance scores.
   Conclusion. This population-wide study found significant stigma towards people with mental illness and identified specific groups who have more stigmatising attitudes. The study also found that having a friend or family member with similar problems was associated with having lower personal as well as social distance stigma. There is a need for well-planned and culturally relevant anti-stigma campaigns in this population that take into consideration the findings of this study.

AB Background and Objective. Efficiency in scale design reduces respondent burden. A brief but reliable measure of numeracy may provide a useful research tool eligible for integration into large epidemiological studies or clinical trials. Our goal was to validate a 3-item version of the Subjective Numeracy Scale (SNS-3). Design and Setting. We examined 7 separate cross-sectional data sets: patients in the emergency department (n = 208), clinic (n = 205), and hospital (n = 460; n = 2053) and patients with chronic kidney disease (n = 147), with diabetes (n = 318), and on hemodialysis (n = 143). Measurements: Internal reliability of the SNS-3 was assessed with Cronbach's . Criterion validity was determined by nonparametric correlations of the SNS-3 with SNS-8 and other measures of numeracy; construct validity was determined by correlations with measures of health literacy and education. Results: The SNS-3 had good internal reliability (median Cronbach's = 0.78) and correlated highly with the full SNS (median = 0.91). The SNS-3 was significantly correlated with other measures of numeracy (e.g., median = 0.57 with the Wide Range Achievement Test 4), health literacy (e.g., median = 0.35 with the Shortened Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults), and education (median = 0.41), providing good evidence of criterion and construct validity. Conclusion: The SNS-3 is sufficiently reliable and valid to be used as a measure of subjective numeracy.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the association between low caregiver health literacy and child emergency department (ED) use, both the number and urgency of ED visits.
   METHODS: This year long cross-sectional study utilized the Newest Vital Sign questionnaire to measure the health literacy of caregivers accompanying children to a pediatric ED. Prior ED visits were extracted from a regional database. ED visit urgency was classified by resources utilized during the index ED visit. Regression analyses were used to model 2 outcomes prior ED visits and ED visit urgency stratified by chronic illness. Analyses were weighted by triage level.
   RESULTS: Overall, 503 caregivers completed the study; 55% demonstrated low health literacy. Children of caregivers with low health literacy had more prior ED visits (adjusted incidence rate ratio 1.5; 95% confidence interval 1.2, 1.8) and increased odds of a nonurgent index ED visit (adjusted odds ratio 2.4; 95% confidence interval 1.3, 4.4). Among children without chronic illness, low caregiver health literacy was associated with an increased proportion of nonurgent index ED visits (48% vs 22%; adjusted odds ratio 3.2; 1.8, 5.7).
   CONCLUSIONS: Over half of caregivers presenting with their children to the ED have low health literacy. Low caregiver health literacy is an independent predictor of higher ED use and use of the ED for nonurgent conditions. In children without a chronic illness, low health literate caregivers had more than 3 tunes greater odds of presenting for a nonurgent condition than those with adequate health literacy.

AB Objectives. We examined associations between health literacy and predictors of smoking cessation among 402 low-socioeconomic status (SES), racially/ethnically diverse smokers.
   Methods. Data were collected as part of a larger study evaluating smoking health risk messages. We conducted multiple linear regression analyses to examine relations between health literacy and predictors of smoking cessation (i.e., nicotine dependence, smoking outcome expectancies, smoking risk perceptions and knowledge, self-efficacy, intentions to quit or reduce smoking).
   Results. Lower health literacy was associated with higher nicotine dependence, more positive and less negative smoking outcome expectancies, less knowledge about smoking health risks, and lower risk perceptions. Associations remained significant (P<.05) after controlling for demographics and SES-related factors.
   Conclusions. These results provide the first evidence that low health literacy may serve as a critical and independent risk factor for poor cessation outcomes among low-socioeconomic status, racially/ethnically diverse smokers. Research is needed to investigate potential mechanisms underlying this relationship.

AB Objective: Health literacy refers to an individual's ability to seek, understand, and use health information. This paper describes the development and psychometric testing of the Health Literacy Management Scale (HeLMS).
   Methods: Content areas were identified from a conceptual framework derived from interviews and concept mapping. Items were generated from. statements from concept mapping participants. Construction (N = 333) and replication (N = 350) samples were participants in chronic disease self-management programs and emergency department attendees. Factor analysis was used to refine constructs and define psychometric properties.
   Results: Consultations generated 8 scales each with 4-5 items: Understanding health information, Accessing GP healthcare services, Communication with health professionals, Being proactive and Using health information, Patient attitudes towards their health, Social support, and Socioeconomic considerations. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated good fit of the data with the model (RMSEA = 0.07, SRMR = 0.05, CFI = 0.97) and all domains had high internal consistency (Cronbach alpha > 0.82).
   Conclusion: The HeLMS has acceptable psychometric properties and assesses a range of health literacy constructs important to patients when seeking, understanding and using health information within the healthcare system.
   Practice implications: The HeLMS presents a new approach to assessing health literacy in healthcare settings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study explored health-related organizations' use of Twitter in delivering health literacy messages. A content analysis of 571 tweets from health-related organizations revealed that the organizations' tweets were often quoted or retweeted by other Twitter users. Nonprofit organizations and community groups had more tweets about health literacy than did other types of health-related organizations examined, including health business corporations, educational institutions, and government agencies. Tweets on health literacy topics focused predominantly on using simple language rather than complicated language. The results suggest that health organizations need a more strategic approach to managing positive organizational self-presentations in order to create an optimal level of exposure on social networking sites.

AB BACKGROUND: Patient comprehension during surgical informed consent remains problematic. Using data from our randomized trial of methods to improve informed consent comprehension, we performed an additional analysis to define independent factors associated with improved patient understanding.
   STUDY DESIGN: Patients scheduled for 1 of 4 elective operations (total hip arthroplasty [n = 137], carotid endarterectomy [n = 178], laparoscopic cholecystectomy [n = 179], or radical prostatectomy [n = 81]) at 7 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers were enrolled. All informed consent discussions were performed using iMedConsent (Dialog Medical), the VA's computerized informed consent platform. Using a unique module within iMedConsent, we randomized patients to repeat back (RB), requiring correct reiteration of procedure-specific facts, or standard (STD) iMedConsent. Patient comprehension was tested after the informed consent discussion using procedure-specific questionnaires. Time spent completing the informed consent process was measured using time stamps within iMedConsent. Multiple linear regression identified factors independently associated with improved comprehension.
   RESULTS: We enrolled 575 patients (276 RB, 299 standard); 93% were male, 74% were Caucasian, and 89% had at least a high school education. Independent factors associated with improved comprehension included race (p < 0.01), ethnicity (p < 0.05), age (p < 0.02), operation type (p < 0.01), group assignment (+/- RB; p < 0.05), and total consent time (p < 0.0001). Patient comprehension was maximized when informed consent took between 15 and 30 minutes. RB's positive impact on patient comprehension was weaker in the analysis including consent time.
   CONCLUSIONS: Comprehension during informed consent discussions may be limited in individuals with potential language difficulty due to ethnicity or education. Total consent time was the strongest predictor of patient comprehension. Affording adequate time for informed consent discussions and using informed consent adjuncts such as RB may enhance comprehension in such individuals. (J Am Coll Surg 2010;210:919-926.

AB Health literacy has been recognized as an important public health issue over the past decade. Low health literacy is a widespread problem in the general population, affecting over 90 million Americans. A growing body of research has demonstrated the association between low health literacy and worse health outcomes in a variety of chronic conditions. Despite the increasing prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the considerable interest in health literacy, there has been limited research examining the role of health literacy in individuals at all stages of CKD. This article examines the role of health literacy in kidney disease by reviewing early research on the topic, providing a conceptual model of the relationship between health literacy and health outcomes, and highlighting potential areas for future research on health literacy in CKD.

TI Health literacy: A concept/dimensional analysis
SO NURSING & HEALTH SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
DE concept analysis; dimensional analysis; health literacy
ID EDUCATION; BELIEFS
AB The terms "health" and "literacy" form a powerful concept that has evolved from the 1970s to one that has garnered the attention of a wide range of disciplines: most notably, education and health care, but also library science, public health, and the mental health arena. There are many definitions of health literacy, but none that encompass the totality by which the concept is constructed. This paper presents an analysis of the concept of health literacy using the technique of concept/dimensional analysis. A clear understanding of the concept is essential as health literacy has implications that are far-reaching and impact both the individual and society.

TI Cognition and health literacy in patients with hypertension
SO JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE health literacy; hypertension; working memory; aging
ID BLOOD-PRESSURE; PERFORMANCE; IMPAIRMENT; KNOWLEDGE; MEMORY; AGE
AB BACKGROUND: Approximately half of the US population has marginal or inadequate health literacy, a measure highly associated with health outcomes. This measure is often linked to age and education, but recent evidence from patients with chronic heart failure suggests that much of age-related variability in health literacy can be explained by cognitive abilities (e.g., working memory, processing speed).
   OBJECTIVE: We examined the role of cognitive and sensory abilities as mediators of age and education in determining functional health literacy among patients with hypertension.
   PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred ninety two community-dwelling adults diagnosed with hypertension (aged 21 to 92 years) participated. They were primarily female (73%), African-American (68%), and reported taking on average 7.8 prescribed medications.
   MEASUREMENTS: Before participation in a medication adherence intervention study, participants completed a battery of health literacy-related tasks. They completed tests that measured health literacy [Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (STOFHLA)], cognitive abilities (working memory, processing speed), sensory abilities (visual acuity and hearing), and physical health.
   RESULTS: Regression analyses showed that health literacy was related to age, education, and race (accounting for 24.4% of variance in STOFHLA scores). Cognitive ability accounted for an additional 24% of variance and greatly reduced the influence of age, education, and race (by 75%, 40%, and 48%, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: When controlling for cognitive and sensory variables, the association of age and education with STOFHLA scores was dramatically reduced. Thus, future interventions aimed at improving self-care for patients with low health literacy should aim to reduce demands on patients' cognitive abilities.

AB Purpose. Disparities in the treatment,of, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mellitus, and cancer among the sexes and racial. groups and possible interventions are discussed.
   Summary. The ongoing process to identify and reduce health disparities, has en engaged numerous federal agencies as they monitor, the nation's progress toward policy-driven and health-related objectives. Cardiovascular, disease disproportionately affects rhPority groups and is the leading cause of death among women in the United States, and, both groups receive suboptimal care: for the disease. Disparities in the treatment of diabetes mellitus in African, Americans women, patients with less than a high school education, and the elderly,have been found. Many minority. groups continue to suffer disproportionely from cancer. Racial disparities also exist in cancer screening and treatment. Minorities are underrepresented in clinical trials for multiple reasons, many of which may be related to cultural beliefs. At all levels of coinsurrance, the poor are less likely to seek preventive care. Adherence to national screening and treatment guidelines, clinical trial recuitment and participation, addressing and geographic barriers, an increasing access to insurance are part of the coordinated efforts required to reduce health disparities. Because pharmacists influence patients' health status directly through pharmacetical care and indirectly by engaging patients in their treatment, it is essential for pharmacists to be able to provide culturally competent care.
   Conclusion. Despite significant efforts over the past several years, health, disparities ties continue to exist, particularly among minority groups. Interventions aimed at eliminating these disparities should include ensuring cultural competence among health care providers and improving health literacy among patients.

AB People living with HIV/AIDS who have lower health literacy show poorer treatment adherence and more adverse health outcomes. The authors undertook the development and pilot testing of a brief HIV treatment adherence improvement counseling intervention for people with lower health literacy who were taking antiretroviral medications. Guided by a theory of health behavior change, health education principles for lower literacy populations, and formative research, the authors designed a two-session plus one booster session nurse-delivered HIV treatment adherence intervention. Results from a pilot test with 30 HIV-positive men and women with lower health literacy showed that the intervention increased HIV/AIDS knowledge, intentions to improve adherence, and self-efficacy for adhering to medications. Participants exposed to the intervention also showed improvement in medication adherence, with reductions in numbers of missed pills and reductions in numbers of doses taken off-schedule. These results suggest that relatively brief behavioral interventions that are tailored for people with lower health literacy may have a significant impact on health-related behaviors.

TI Assessing health literacy in African American and Caucasian adults:
   Disparities in rapid estimate of adult literacy in medicine (REALM)
   scores
SO FAMILY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID KNOWLEDGE; ASSOCIATION
AB Background and Objectives: The influence of literacy on health and health care is an important area of investigation. Studies with a literacy focus are most valuable when literacy is assessed with psychometrically sound instruments. Methods: This study used a prospective cohort sample of 1,610 primary care patients. Patients provided sociodemographics and took the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM), a 66-item word pronunciation literacy test. Results: The sample was 65% African American; 66% were men; 51% had a high school education or less. REALM scores were significantly related to education, age, and race but not gender When stratified by education, differences between African Americans and Caucasians remained significant. Using 19 different strategies to shorten the 66-item instrument, reliability coefficients above .80 were maintained. Conclusions: The REALM is a robust assessment of health literacy. However, the discordance in scores between African Americans and Caucasians with similar educational attainment needs to be further addressed. A much shorter instrument would still have internally consistent scores and potentially be more useful in clinical settings.

DT Article
DE Internet; mental health; prevention; treatment; websites
ID WORLD-WIDE-WEB; INFORMATION; FUTURE
AB Objective: This paper describes the informational and treatment opportunities offered by the Worldwide Web (WWW) and comments on the advantages, disadvantages and potential dangers of its role in mental health and mental health research.
   Method: Two perspectives are taken: (i) the impact of the Web from the point of view of the clinician (the practitioner view) and (ii) the impact of the Web on the public's knowledge of mental health (mental health literacy; the community or public health view). These perspectives are applied to two areas of impact: (i) information and knowledge; and (ii) treatment and self-help.
   Results: The Web, due to its accessibility, has advantages in providing access to information, online therapy and adjunctive therapy in mental health. Problems include information overload, poor information quality, potential harm and lack of scientific evaluation,
   Conclusions: Issues of overload and quality of information, the potential for harm and the need to evaluate interventions are not unique to the Internet. However, the Internet has special features which make these issues more prominent. The Internet is likely to increase the general public's access to information and to decrease unmet need. Sites and interventions on the Internet need to be formally evaluated.

AB Background: Despite the large volume of research dedicated to health-related behavior change, chronic disease costs continue to rise, thus creating a major public health burden. Health literacy, the ability to seek, understand, and utilize health information, has been identified as an important factor in the course of chronic conditions. Little research has been conducted on the relationship between health literacy and health-related behaviors and health status in elderly Chinese. The aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between health literacy and health-related behaviors and health status in China. Methods: The subjects enrolled in this study were selected based on a stratified cluster random sampling design. Information involving >4500 older adults in 44 pension institutions in Urumqi, Changji, Karamay, and Shihezi of Xinjiang between September 2011 and June 2012 was collected. The Chinese Citizen Health Literacy Questionnaire (China Health Education Centre, 2008) and a Scale of the General Status were administered and the information was obtained through face-to-face inquiries by investigators. A total of 1452 respondents met the inclusion criteria. A total of 1452 questionnaires were issued and the valid response rate was 96.14% (1396 of 1452). Factors affecting health literacy and the relationship to health literacy were identified by one-way ANOVA and a multiple linear regression model. Results: The average health literacy level of the elderly in nursing homes was relatively low (71.74 +/- 28.35 points). There were significant differences in the health literacy score among the factors of age, gender, race, education level, household income, marital conditions, and former occupation (p < 0.001). The health literacy score was significantly associated with smoking, drinking, physical exercise, and health examination (p < 0.001). The elderly with higher health literacy scores were significantly less likely to have risky behaviors (smoking, regular drinking, and lack of physical exercise), and in turn significantly more likely to undergo health examinations regularly, report good self-rated health, and significantly more likely to access sufficient health information from multiple sources (p < 0.001). No differences were noted between the health literacy score and BMI (p > 0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the independent influencing factors of health literacy included education level, race, former occupation, household income, age, physical exercise, health examination, smoking, and health information access (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Health literacy was significantly associated with health-related behaviors in elderly Chinese. Further longitudinal studies are needed to help confirm that improving health literacy in the elderly may be effective in changing health-related behaviors. To reduce risky habits, educational interventions to improve health literacy should be simultaneously conducted in health promotion work.

TI No Easy Talk: A Mixed Methods Study of Doctor Reported Barriers to
   Conducting Effective End-of-Life Conversations with Diverse Patients
SO PLOS ONE

   CARE; PERCEPTIONS; TRUST; RACE
AB Objective
   Though most patients wish to discuss end-of-life (EOL) issues, doctors are reluctant to conduct end-of-life conversations. Little is known about the barriers doctors face in conducting effective EOL conversations with diverse patients. This mixed methods study was undertaken to empirically identify barriers faced by doctors (if any) in conducting effective EOL conversations with diverse patients and to determine if the doctors' age, gender, ethnicity and medical sub-specialty influenced the barriers reported.
   Design
   Mixed-methods study of multi-specialty doctors caring for diverse, seriously ill patients in two large academic medical centers at the end of the training; data were collected from 2010 to 2012.
   Outcomes
   Doctor-reported barriers to EOL conversations with diverse patients.
   Results
   1040 of 1234 potential subjects (84.3%) participated. 29 participants were designated as the development cohort for coding and grounded theory analyses to identify primary barriers. The codes were validated by analyses of responses from 50 randomly drawn subjects from the validation cohort (n=996 doctors). Qualitative responses from the validation cohort were coded and analyzed using quantitative methods. Only 0.01% doctors reported no barriers to conducting EOL conversations with patients. 99.99% doctors reported barriers with 85.7% finding it very challenging to conduct EOL conversations with all patients and especially so with patients whose ethnicity was different than their own. Asian-American doctors reported the most struggles (91.3%), followed by African Americans (85.3%), Caucasians (83.5%) and Hispanic Americans (79.3%) in conducting EOL conversations with their patients. The biggest doctor-reported barriers to effective EOL conversations are (i) language and medical interpretation issues, (ii) patient/family religio-spiritual beliefs about death and dying, (iii) doctors' ignorance of patients' cultural beliefs, values and practices, (iv) patient/family's cultural differences in truth handling and decision making, (v) patients' limited health literacy and (vi) patients' mistrust of doctors and the health care system. The doctors' ethnicity (Chi-Square = 12.77, DF = 4, p = 0.0125) and medical subspecialty (Chi-Square = 19.33, DF = 10, p = 0.036) influenced their reported barriers. Friedman's test used to examine participants relative ranking of the barriers across sub-groups identified significant differences by age group (F statistic = 303.5, DF = 5, p < 0.0001) and medical sub-specialty (F statistic = 163.7, DF = 5, p < 0.0001).
   Conclusions and Relevance
   Doctors report struggles with conducting effective EOL conversations with all patients and especially with those whose ethnicity is different from their own. It is vital to identify strategies to mitigate barriers doctors encounter in conducting effective EOL conversations with seriously ill patients and their families.

AB The results showed that the MHL measure is highly scalable (0.80) includes four sequenced categories: identification/recognition, critical evaluation of health content in media, perceived influence on adolescents and intended action/reaction. Multivariate analysis showed that MHL was significantly higher among girls (beta = 1.25, P < 0.001), adolescents whose mothers had higher education (beta = 0.16, P = 0.04), who report more adult/interpersonal sources of health information (beta = 0.23, P < 0.01) and was positively associated with health empowerment (beta = 0.36, P < 0.0005) and health behavior (beta = 0.03, P = 0.05). The findings suggest that as a determinant of adolescent health behavior, MHL identifies groups at risk and may provide a basis for health promotion among youth.

AB Rural residency and low socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with increased likelihood of chronic pain. Other demographics are also differentially associated with the experience of pain. This study examines the relations between demographic and pain-related variables in a virtually unstudied population of rural Alabama chronic pain patients. One hundred and fifteen patients completed validated measures of pain catastrophizing, depression, pain intensity, pain interference, perceived disability, and life satisfaction. Average age of study participants was 52-years, 79% were female, 74% were African-American, 72% reported annual income between 00,000-12,999, and 61% were unemployed. Although average years of reported education was 12.26, reading level percentile (primary literacy indicant) was 17.33. Cross-sectional multivariate and univariate analyses were conducted to examine associations among demographic and psychosocial variables in relation to various pre-treatment pain-related variables. The mediating role of pain catastrophizing and depression was investigated. Results indicate that race was significantly associated with pain intensity and pain interference, such that African-Americans reported higher scores than White-Americans. Pain catastrophizing was uniquely associated with pain intensity, pain interference, and perceived disability; depression was uniquely associated with pain interference and life satisfaction. Pain catastrophizing mediated the relation between primary literacy and pain intensity; age effects were differentially mediated by either pain catastrophizing or depression. These analyses provide an insight into the specific demographic and psychosocial factors associated with chronic pain in a low-literacy, low-SES rural population.

AB Objective: This study examined the effect of a theoretically grounded, tailored education-coaching intervention to help patients more effectively discuss their pain-related questions, concerns, and preferences with physicians.
   Methods: Grounded in social-cognitive and communication theory, a tailored education-coaching (TEC) intervention was developed to help patients learn pain management and communication skills. In a RCT, 148 cancer patients agreed to have their consultations audio-recorded and were assigned to the intervention or a control group. The recordings were used to code for patients' questions, acts of assertiveness, and expressed concerns and to rate the quality of physicians' communication.
   Results: Patients in the TEC group discussed their pain concerns more than did patients in the control group. More active patients also had more baseline pain and interacted with physicians using participatory decision-making. Ratings of physicians' information about pain were higher when patients talked more about their pain concerns.
   Conclusions: The study demonstrates the efficacy of a theoretically grounded, coaching intervention to help cancer patients talk about pain control.
   Practice implications: Coaching interventions can be effective resources for helping cancer patients communicate about their pain concerns if they are theoretically grounded, can be integrated within clinical routines, and lead to improve health outcomes.

AB Latinos maintain an AIDS case rate more than 3 times higher than whites, a greater rate of progression to AIDS, and a higher rate of HIV/AIDS-related deaths. Three broad areas are reviewed related to these disparities: (1) relevant demographic, socioeconomic, and socio-cultural factors among Latinos; (2) drug abuse and mental health problems in Latinos relevant to HIV/AIDS outcomes; and (3) opportunities for psychosocial intervention. Latinos living with HIV are a rapidly growing group, are more severely impacted by HIV than whites, and confront unique challenges in coping with HIV/AIDS. A body of research suggests that depression, substance abuse, treatment adherence, health literacy, and access to healthcare may be fruitful targets for intervention research in this population. Though limited, the current literature suggests that psychosocial interventions that target these factors could help reduce HIV/AIDS disparities between Latinos and whites and could have important public health value.

AB Asthma is a common, chronic illness with substantial morbidity, especially for, racial and ethnic minorities in the United States. The care of the patient with asthma is complex and depends ideally on excellent communication between patients and health-care providers. Communication is essential for the patient to communicate the severity of his or her illness, as well as for the health-care provider to instruct patients on pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic care. This article describes evidence for poor provider/patient communication as a contributor to healthcare disparities for minority patients with asthma. Communication problems stem from issues with patients, health-care providers, and health-care systems. It is likely that asthma disparities can be improved, in part, by improving patient/provider communication. While much is known presently about the problem of patient/provider communication in asthma, there is a need to improve and extend the evidence base on the role of effective communication of asthma care and the links to outcomes for minorities. Additional studies are needed that document the extent to which problems with doctor/patient communication lead to inadequate care and poor outcomes for minorities with asthma, as well as mechanisms by which these disparities occur.

AB Objective: To assess the public's knowledge about depression, attitudes toward treatments for depression, perceived causal factors for depression, and reported prognoses of depression, overall and by sex.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional telephone survey in Alberta between February and June 2006. We used a random phone number selection procedure to identify a sample of adults in the community (n = 3047). Participants were presented with a vignette describing an individual with depression and then asked questions to assess recognition of depression, attitudes toward mental health treatments, possible causal factors for depression, and prognosis of depression.
   Results: The response rate was 75.2 %. Among the final participants, 75.6% could correctly recognize depression described in a case vignette. General practitioners or family doctors were considered as being the best help for depression. Of the participants, 35% were in complete agreement with health professionals about appropriate interventions for depression, 28% believed in dealing with depression alone, and 43% thought that "weakness of character" was a likely cause of depression. Men had poorer mental health literacy than women and were more likely to endorse the use of alcohol to cope.
   Conclusions: Mental health promotion and education efforts are needed to improve the general public's mental health literacy and to clarify misunderstanding about depression. Men need to be a particular target of these efforts.

AB Achieving cultural competence in the care of a patient who is a member of an ethnic or racial minority is a multifaceted project involving specific cultural knowledge as well as more general skills and attitude adjustments to advance cross-cultural communication in the clinical encounter. Using the important example of the African American patient, the authors examine relevant historical and cultural information as it relates to providing culturally competent health care. The authors identify key influences, including the legacy of slavery, Jim Crow discrimination, the Tuskegee syphilis study, religion's interaction with health care, the use of home remedies, distrust, racial concordance and discordance, and health literacy. The authors propose that the awareness of specific information pertaining to ethnicity and race enhances cross-cultural communication and ways to improve the cultural competence of physicians and other health care providers by providing a historical and social context for illness in another culture. Cultural education, modular in nature, can be geared to the specific populations served by groups of physicians and provider organizations. Educational methods should include both information about relevant social group history as well as some experiential component to emotively communicate particular cultural needs. The authors describe particular techniques that help bridge the cross-cultural clinical communication gaps that are created by patients' mistrust, lack of cultural understanding, differing paradigms for illness, and health illiteracy.

AB Digital health innovations have been rapidly implemented and scaled to provide solutions to health delivery challenges posed by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. This has provided people with ongoing access to vital health services while minimizing their potential exposure to infection and allowing them to maintain social distancing. However, these solutions may have unintended consequences for health equity. Poverty, lack of access to digital health, poor engagement with digital health for some communities, and barriers to digital health literacy are some factors that can contribute to poor health outcomes. We present the Digital Health Equity Framework, which can be used to consider health equity factors. Along with person-centered care, digital health equity should be incorporated into health provider training and should be championed at the individual, institutional, and social levels. Important future directions will be to develop measurement-based approaches to digital health equity and to use these findings to further validate and refine this model.

AB BACKGROUNDThe 5-year relative survival for prostate cancers diagnosed between 1990 and 1994 in the United States was very high (92%); however, survival in black males was 7% lower compared with white males. The authors updated these findings and examined survival by stage and race.
   METHODSThe authors used data from the CONCORD-2 study for males (ages 15-99 years) who were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 37 states, covering 80% of the US population. Survival was adjusted for background mortality (net survival) using state-specific and race-specific life tables and was age-standardized. Data were presented for 2001 through 2003 and 2004 through 2009 to account for changes in collecting SEER Summary Stage 2000.
   RESULTSAmong the 1,527,602 prostate cancers diagnosed between 2001 and 2009, the proportion of localized cases increased from 73% to 77% in black males and from 77% to 79% in white males. Although the proportion of distant-stage cases was higher among black males than among white males, they represented less than 6% of cases in both groups between 2004 and 2009. Net survival exceeded 99% for localized stage between 2004 and 2009 in both racial groups. Overall, and in most states, 5-year net survival exceeded 95%.
   CONCLUSIONSProstate cancer survival has increased since the first CONCORD study, and the racial gap has narrowed. Earlier detection of localized cancers likely contributed to this finding. However, racial disparities also were observed in overall survival. To help understand which factors might contribute to the persistence of this disparity, states could use local data to explore sociodemographic characteristics, such as survivors' health insurance status, health literacy, treatment decision-making processes, and treatment preferences. Cancer 2017;123:5160-77. Published 2017. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.
   Population-based prostate cancer survival in the United States is high (97%) for men diagnosed between 2001 and 2009, but racial disparities persist. The percentages of both black and white males diagnosed with localized stage cancer increased during this period, however, and 5-year survival for males diagnosed at this stage exceeds 99%.

AB There is a growing need to understand how health literacy influences health outcomes in diverse populations. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between health literacy, health behavior, sociodemographic indicators, and self-assessed health in the adult population in Israel while identifying populations at risk for low health literacy. A cross-sectional national survey was conducted among 600 adults randomly selected from a national database. The Health Literacy Survey-Europe-Q16 (HLS-EU-Q16) research instrument, adapted for use in Israel, was the basis for home interviews in Hebrew, Russian, and Arabic. Three levels of health literacy were distinguished: More than 31% of the sample had inadequate or problematic health literacy, and 69% showed likely sufficient health literacy. Logistic regression analyses showed that after we controlled for other determinants, years of education (beta = 1.8) and income (beta = 2.2) were significantly associated with health literacy. Multinomial logistic regression analysis showed that health literacy, along with age, was the strongest independent variable associated with self-assessed health. Thus, health literacy, strongly influenced by income and years of education, may play a key role in determining self-assessed health, a proxy health outcome, beyond sociodemographic variables. The study results contribute to understanding the role of health literacy in health disparities and identifying action areas for health promotion.

TI Association between health literacy and medical care costs in an

ID LIMITED LITERACY; IMPACT
AB Background: Low health literacy is associated with higher health care utilization and costs; however, no large-scale studies have demonstrated this in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). This research evaluated the association between veterans' health literacy and their subsequent VHA health care costs across a three-year period.
   Methods: This retrospective study used a Generalized Linear Model to estimate the relative association between a patient's health literacy and VHA medical costs, adjusting for covariates. Secondary data sources included electronic health records and administrative data in the VHA (e.g., Medical and DCG SAS Datasets and DSS-National Data Extracts). Health literacy assessments and identifiers were electronically retrieved from the originating health system. Demographic and cost data were retrieved from the VHA centralized databases for the corresponding patients who had VHA use in all three years.
   Results: In a study of 92,749 veterans with service utilization from 2007-2009, average per patient cost for those with inadequate and marginal health literacy was significantly higher ($ 31,581 [95 % CI: $ 30,186 - $ 2,975]; $ 23,508 [95 % CI: $ 22,749 - $ 24,268]) than adequate health literacy ($ 17,033 [95 % CI: $ 16,810 - $ 17,255]). Estimated three-year cost associated with veterans' with marginal and inadequate health literacy was $ 143 million dollars more than those with adequate health literacy.
   Conclusions: Analyses suggest when controlling for other person-level factors within the VHA integrated healthcare system, lower health literacy is a significant independent factor associated with increased health care utilization and costs. This study confirms the association of lower health literacy with higher medical service utilization and pharmacy costs for veterans enrolled in the VHA. Confirmation of higher costs of care associated with lower health literacy suggests that interventions might be designed to remediate health literacy needs and reduce expenditures. These analyses suggest 17.2 % (inadequate & marginal) of the Veterans in this population account for almost one-quarter (24 %) of VA medical and pharmacy cost for this 3-year period. Meeting the needs of those with marginal and inadequate health literacy could produce potential economic savings of approximately 8 % of total costs for this population.

AB Stigma is a well-documented concern of people living with mental illness. Through the use of novel exploratory structural equation modelling (ESEM) methods, we aimed to elucidate the structure of stigma as measured by two stigma scales (the Depression Stigma Scale and the Social Distance Scale), to establish dimensions of stigma towards a range of disorders and to compare levels on these dimensions between disorders and respondent subgroups. We used data from two Australian national surveys, one of the general community aged 15+ and another of youths aged 15-25. Stigma responses were elicited using a range of mental illness vignettes: depression, schizophrenia, social phobia and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). ESEM revealed that the structure of stigmatizing attitudes in young people and adults is comparable in personally held attitudes and those perceived in others. Personal and perceived stigma formed distinct dimensions with each comprising Weak-not-sick and Dangerous/unpredictable components. The social distance dimension of stigma was separate from other components of stigma, supporting the appropriateness of the existing Social Distance Scale. Scales reflecting these dimensions had different patterns of association with respondent age and gender, and the type of mental disorder portrayed in the vignette.

AB Objective: We tested the association between child and parental health literacy (HL) and odds of child and adolescent obesity.
   Methods: We conducted an anonymous cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample of English-speaking child-parent dyads. Newest Vital Sign (NVS) measured HE We used multivariable logistic regression to test adjusted association between child and parental NVS and obesity. Analyses were stratified for school-aged children (aged 7-11) vs. adolescents (aged 12-19).
   Results: We surveyed 239 child-parent dyads. Median child age was 11 [inter-quartile range 9-13]; 123 (51%) were male; 84% Medicaid recipients; 27% obese. For children, the odds of obesity [adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval)] decreased with higher parent NVS [0.75 (0.56,1.00)] and increased with parent obesity [2.53 (1.08,5.94)]. For adolescents, odds of obesity were higher for adolescents with the lowest category of NVS [5.00 (1.26, 19.8)] and older parental age [1.07 (1.01,1.14)] and lower for Medicaid recipients [0.21 (0.06,0.78)] and higher parental education [0.38 (0.22,0.63)].
   Conclusion: Obesity in school-aged children is associated with parental factors (obesity, parental HL); obesity in adolescents is strongly associated with the adolescent's HL.
   Practice implications: Strategies to prevent and treat obesity should consider limited HL of parents for child obesity and of adolescents for adolescent obesity. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Background-Self-care training can reduce hospitalization for heart failure (HF), and more intensive intervention may benefit more vulnerable patients, including those with low literacy.
   Methods and Results-A 1-year, multisite, randomized, controlled comparative effectiveness trial with 605 patients with HF was conducted. Those randomized to a single session received a 40-minute in-person, literacy-sensitive training; the multisession group received the same initial training and then ongoing telephone-based support. The primary outcome was combined incidence of all-cause hospitalization or death; secondary outcomes included HF-related hospitalization and HF-related quality of life, with prespecified stratification by literacy. Overall, the incidence of all-cause hospitalization and death did not differ between intervention groups (incidence rate ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.83-1.22). The effect of multisession training compared with single-session training differed by literacy group: Among those with low literacy, the multisession training yielded a lower incidence of all-cause hospitalization and death (incidence rate ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.45-1.25), and among those with higher literacy, the multisession intervention yielded a higher incidence (incidence rate ratio, 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.99-1.50; interaction P=0.048). For HF-related hospitalization, among those with low literacy, multisession training yielded a lower incidence (incidence rate ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-1.12), and among those with higher literacy, it yielded a higher incidence (incidence rate ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-1.88; interaction P=0.005). HF-related quality of life improved more for patients receiving multisession than for those receiving single-session interventions at 1 and 6 months, but the difference at 12 months was smaller. Effects on HF-related quality of life did not differ by literacy.
   Conclusions-Overall, an intensive multisession intervention did not change clinical outcomes compared with a single-session intervention. People with low literacy appear to benefit more from multisession interventions than people with higher literacy.

AB Context. Individuals from low socioeconomic (SE) groups have less resources and poorer health outcomes. Understanding the nature of access to appropriate end-of-life care services for this group is important.
   Objectives. To evaluate the literature in the developed world for barriers to access for low SE groups.
   Methods. Electronic databases searched in the review included MEDLINE (1996-2010), CINAHL (1996-2010), PsychINFO (2000-2010), Clochrane Library (2010), and EMBASE (1996-2010). Publications were searched for key terms "socioeconomic disadvantage," "socioeconomic," "poverty," "poor" paired with "end-of-life care," "palliative care," "dying," and "terminal Illness." Articles were analyzed using existing descriptions for dimensions of access to health services, which include availability, affordability, acceptability, and geographical access.
   Results. A total of 67 articles were identified for the literature review. Literature describing end-of-life care and low SE status was limited. Findings from the review were summarized under the headings for dimensions of access.
   Conclusion. Low SE groups experience barriers to access in palliative care services. Identification and evaluation of interventions aimed at reducing this disparity is required.

AB Depression affects approximately 15% of the US population, and is recognized as an important risk factor for poor outcomes among patients with various illnesses. Automated health education and behavior change programs have the potential to help address many of the shortcomings in health care. However, the role of these systems in the care of patients with depression has been insufficiently examined. In the current study, we sought to evaluate how hospitalized medical patients would respond to a computer animated conversational agent that has been developed to provide information in an empathic fashion about a patient's hospital discharge plan. In particular, we sought to examine how patients who have a high level of depressive symptoms respond to this system. Therapeutic alliance - the trust and belief that a patient and provider have in working together to achieve a desired therapeutic outcome - was used as the primary outcome measure, since it has been shown to be important in predicting outcomes across a wide range of health problems, including depression. In an evaluation of 139 hospital patients who interacted with the agent at the time of discharge, all patients, regardless of depressive symptoms, rated the agent very high on measures of satisfaction and ease of use, and most preferred receiving their discharge information from the agent compared to their doctors or nurses in the hospital. In addition, we found that patients with symptoms indicative of major depression rated the agent significantly higher on therapeutic alliance compared to patients who did not have major depressive symptoms. We conclude that empathic agents represent a promising technology for patient assessment, education and counseling for those most in need of comfort and caring in the inpatient setting.

TI Barriers and facilitators to the utilization of adult mental health

AB Mental disorders are the second leading cause of disease burden among Australia's Indigenous people after cardiovascular disease. Yet Indigenous people do not access mental health services in proportion to their need. This paper explores the barriers and facilitators for Indigenous people seeking mental health services in Australia and identifies key elements in the development and maintenance of partnerships for improved service delivery and future research. The process of seeking help for mental illness has been conceptualized as four consecutive steps starting from recognizing that there is a problem to actually contacting the mental health service. We have attempted to explore the factors affecting each of these stages. While people in the general population experience barriers across all four stages of the process of seeking treatment for a mental disorder, there are many more barriers for Indigenous people at the stage of actually contacting a mental health service. These include a history of racism and discrimination and resultant lack of trust in mainstream services, misunderstandings due to cultural and language differences, and inadequate measures to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness. Further research is required to understand the mental health literacy of Indigenous people, their different perceptions of mental health and well-being, issues around stigma, and the natural history of mental illness among Indigenous people who do not access any form of professional help. Collaborations between mainstream mental health services and Aboriginal organizations have been promoted as a way to conduct research into developing appropriate services for Indigenous people.

AB Objective: This study explored the patient's experience of the doctor-patient relationship and information giving in health care.The views of patients with a range of literacy levels were examined. Method: 32 1 patients at an in-patient cardiology unit provided the sample. The Health Literacy (HL) of participants was assessed using the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM). All participants (low and adequate HL) were then asked open ended questions about their experiences of communication with healthcare professional. The qualitative data underwent a thematic analysis.
   Results: 22% of the patients interviewed were found to have a low level of literacy as indicated by the REALM. Many patients felt that health information should be given in simpler language. Patients frequently stated that they either did not read information leaflets or were confused or worried by them. They described the importance of the doctor-patient relationship and the need to build Up trust. These views were expressed by patients with adequate HL as well as patients with low HL.
   Conclusion: Many patients irrespective of thou HL skills, feel unable to access, Understand and utilize health information.
   Practice implications: If patients are to be actively engaged in achieving and maintaining good health, healthcare professionals must improve their communication skills and ensure that health information is clear and easy to access. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Health Literacy Demands of Written Health Information Materials: An
   Assessment of Cervical Cancer Prevention Materials
SO CANCER CONTROL
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Health literacy requires reading and writing skills as well as knowledge of health topics and health systems. Materials written at high reading levels with ambiguous, technical, or dense text, often place great comprehension demands on consumers with lower literacy skills. This study developed and used an instrument to analyze cervical cancer prevention materials for readability, comprehensibility, suitability, and message design.
   Methods: The Suitability Assessment of Materials (SAM) was amended for ease of use, inclusivity, and objectivity with the encouragement of the original developers. Other novel contributions were specifically related to "comprehensibility" (CAM). The resulting SAM + CAM was used to score 69 materials for content, literacy demand, numeric literacy, graphics, layout/typography, and learning stimulation variables. Expert reviewers provided content validation. Inter-rater reliability was "substantial" (kappa = .77).
   Results: The mean reading level of materials was 11th grade. Most materials (68%) scored as "adequate" for comprehensibility, suitability, and message design; health education brochures scored better than other materials. Only one-fifth were ranked "superior" for ease of use and comprehensibility.
   Conclusions: Most written materials have a readability level that is too high and require improvement in ease of use and comprehensibility for the majority of readers.

AB More than 90 million Americans have low levels of health literacy that may contribute to poor health outcomes. Assessment of the readability of patient education materials (PEMs) is a vital component of health education. Purpose: The aim of this study was to describe the readability of PEMs used in community healthcare settings serving low-income populations to provide further insight into the complex area of health literacy. Design: A descriptive, correlational, and nonexperimental design was used for this study. Setting: The setting for this study was 5 free and low-cost community clinics in a Midwestern urban area. Sample: Thirty-five unique PEMs produced by professional sources (government agencies, drug companies, and state/national organizations) or by providers comprised the final sample. Methods: Readability was measured using Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG), Flesch-Kincaid, and Flesch Reading Ease. Significance was determined through t tests and Spearman p correlations. Findings: Variability in grade levels was noted using all measures. Mean Flesch-Kincaid grade level was 7.01, and that for SMOG was 9.89. Mean level for Flesch Reading Ease was 63.40, an estimated eighth and ninth grade level. The SMOG consistently measured 2 to 4 grades levels higher than did Flesh-Kincaid. Professionally developed PEMs had significantly higher reading levels using both SMOG and Flesch-Kincaid and were more difficult to read using Flesch Reading Ease when compared with those prepared by individual providers. Conclusions: Patient education materials were written at a level too high for the average adult. All PEMs should be analyzed carefully to ensure that they are at the recommended fifth grade level. Further understanding of available measures of readability is critical in the creation and/or assessment of PEMs that will strengthen services from safety net providers and support positive health outcomes. Implications: Nurses must expand their knowledge of all aspects of literacy and readability and take a proactive role in assessment and development of PEMs. Further research is needed to determine the best readability measures.

AB Objective: The physiological, cognitive, language and communicative changes that take place as we enter into old age have become quite well documented within the social scientific literature. Many of these changes lead in some way to a lessening of previous interactive abilities and competencies. The new mantra for gerontologists attempting to help older adults compensate for these potential losses is to develop strategies to maintain existing abilities as long as possible.
   Methods: A literature review using online databases was performed.
   Results: Older adults who are diagnosed with cancer or help care for an individual coping with cancer must confront a health care system that demands a high level of health literacy to successfully manage the disease. Older adults may be at a distinct disadvantage in their ability to successfully cope with cancer because of age-related physiological, cognitive, psychological and communicative factors.
   Conclusion: This paper highlights the relevant research findings and theoretical positioning that points not only to possible pragmatic dilemmas faced by those adapting to cancer but also highlights streams of research that scholars may wish to focus upon to better understand how older adults and their formal and informal caregivers can improve their cancer health literacy.
   Practice implications: Providers, patients, and caregivers must all participate in creating a health care environment of shared meaning and understanding of health messages tailored to the aging patient diagnosed with cancer. Health communication scholars have various theoretical, methodological, and pragmatic communication-based approaches that provide important contributions to the complexities of caring for the aging patient.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate patient knowledge of newly prescribed medication after hospital discharge. We reviewed the charts of 172 patients who were discharged from February 1, 2006, through April 25, 2006, from the internal medicine residency service at a community-based teaching hospital with prescriptions for 1 or more new medications. Between 4 and IS days after discharge, patients were contacted by telephone and asked about the name, number, dosages, schedule, purpose, and adverse effects of the new medication(s) and whether they could name their medical contact person. We recorded the number of correct answers, patient age, and years of education. Of the survey respondents, 86% were aware that they had been prescribed new medications, but fewer could identify the name (64%) or number (74%) of new medications or their dosages (56%), schedule (68%), or purpose (64%). Only 11% could recall being told of any adverse effects, and only 22% could name at least 1 adverse effect. Older patients tended to answer fewer questions correctly (P=.02). We observed no association between the number of correctly answered questions and years of education (P=.57), time between discharge and survey (P=.17), or number of new medications (P=.65). Overall, we found that patients had limited knowledge about their medications after discharge from an internal medicine residency service, with age but not years of education significantly associated with level of knowledge.

AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates are comparatively low for U.S. Hispanics. To learn more about the factors influencing CRC screening among Hispanics living along the U.S.-Mexico border, 12 focus groups were conducted with Hispanic men and women aged 50 years and older in three Texas counties; Cameron County (Brownsville), Webb County (Laredo), and El Paso County, (El Paso). The focus group guide contained questions about health care behavior, knowledge about CRC, experiences with cancer, and factors that influence CRC screening. A total of 92 individuals participated with the majority aged 50-69 (75%). Twenty percent were born in the United States and 51% had lived in the United States for more than 20 years. Participants had low levels of education, income, and insurance coverage. The analysis revealed several overarching and contextual themes relating to knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and emotions about cancer and CRC screening. A prevalent theme that emerged from all groups was frustration and a lack of confidence in the U.S. healthcare system. Few participants had been advised by their providers to obtain CRC screening. Lack of patient knowledge about colorectal cancer and screening appeared to be a critical factor influencing screening. Themes about death and pain due to cancer were prevalent as were cultural factors such as machismo and embarrassment. System level barriers such as cost, medical insurance and transportation also impacted screening. These findings suggest that strategies are needed to educate Hispanic residents of border communities about CRC and to motivate them to undergo CRC screening.

TI Retention and use of breast cancer recurrence risk information from
   genomic tests: The role of health literacy

AB Background: New genomic technology now allows physicians to provide women with individualized and highly accurate breast cancer recurrence risk estimates that are a key factor in adjuvant (after surgery) therapy decisions. Because these genomic tests are so new, little is known about how well patients understand the tests and their results.
   Method: We interviewed 163 stage I or II breast cancer patients at a routine follow-up appointment. We assessed their health literacy (using the Rapid Estimate of Adult Learning in Medicine) as well as their knowledge of and attitudes towards a genomic test that identifies risk of recurrence in hormone receptor-positive, node-negative breast cancer (the OncoType Dx Recurrence Score).
   Results: Women with lower health literacy recalled less of the information provided about the recurrence risk test than women with higher health literacy. Health literacy was not related to the amount of additional information women desired. Women with higher health literacy preferred to have a more active role in decisions about the test.
   Implications: Health literacy may affect women's capacity to learn about the new genomic tests as well as their desire for informed participation in their medical care.

AB Nursing has always struggled for recognition and status, and there has always been exploitation and shortages, and no more so than in psychiatric settings. Today, however, nursing is in truly dire straits and, as a consequence, psychiatric nursing is more precariously positioned than ever. In order to think constructively about psychiatric nursing's future, it is crucial that this wider context in which it operates is fully appreciated, and this paper begins by summarizing the key features of this context from an international perspective. It is argued that dramatic changes occurring in 'Western' societies call for radical changes in public and professional thinking, and in their vision for health care in the future. Beginning with the general nursing context, this paper depicts the perilous state of psychiatric nursing and mental health care in Australia and elsewhere, and suggests some of the causal factors. It concludes by arguing that the future mental health workforce should be a graduate specialist who stands outside existing disciplinary identities.

AB Background: The relationship between patient adherence and treatment outcomes has been documented across chronic health conditions, but the evidence base for effective adherence interventions in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) requires more rigorous research and reporting.
   Objectives: The aims of this study were to determine whether a tailored, nurse-delivered adherence intervention program-Client Adherence Profiling and Intervention Tailoring (CAP-IT) -improved adherence to HIV medications, compared with standard care, and to identify the relationship among adherence measures.
   Methods: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) with repeated measures was used to test the efficacy of CAP-IT over a 6-month period. A convenience sample of 240 participants was recruited from a freestanding public HIV/AIDS clinic in Houston, TX, that provides medical, psychological, and pharmaceutical services for over 5,000 clients. Study instruments and measures included demographics; chart audit to capture CD4 count, viral load, and prescribed medications; health literacy; and five measures of adherence (AIDS Clinical Trial Group-Revised Reasons for Missing Medications, Morisky Self-Report of Medication Non-Adherence, Pill Count, Medication Event Monitoring System [MEMS] caps, and Pharmacy Refill).
   Results: A logistic regression using generalized estimating equations method showed no significant differences over time on the five medication-adherence measures between the experimental and control groups. Little correlation was documented among the five different adherence measures, and there was minimal correlation with clinical markers.
   Discussion: it is unclear why the tailored adherence intervention was not efficacious in improving medication adherence. The findings suggest that these measures of medication adherence did not perform as expected and that, perhaps, they are not adequate measures of adherence. Effective and efficient adherence interventions are needed to address the barriers to medication adherence in HIV/AIDS.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a home-based intervention targeted to parents with intellectual disability to promote child health and home safety in the preschool years. A total of 63 parents were recruited for the study with 45 parents (40 mothers and 5 fathers) from 40 families completing the project. The research design permitted comparison between the intervention and three alternative conditions with all parents receiving the intervention in an alternating sequence over the life of the project. The intervention consisted of 10 weekly lessons carried out in the parent's home focusing on child health and home safety. The program was adapted to suit the Australian context from the UCLA Parent-Child Health and Wellness Project (Tymchuk, Groen, & Dolyniuk, 2000). Outcome measures assessed parental health and safety behaviours. Standard measures included parental health, intelligence and literacy. The intervention improved parents' ability to recognize home dangers, to identify precautions to deal with these dangers and resulted in a significant increase in the number of safety precautions parents implemented in their homes with all gains being maintained at 3 months post-intervention. Parents' health behaviours including improved understanding of health and symptoms of illness, knowledge of and skills needed to manage life-threatening emergencies, knowledge about visiting the doctor, knowing when to call, what information to provide and what questions to ask, and how to use medicines safely significantly increased. Again, all gains were maintained 3 months post-intervention. The intervention was effective regardless of parental health, literacy skills, and IQ. This form of home-based intervention promotes a healthy and safe environment which is a prerequisite to continuing parental custody. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background Depression has been traditionally considered to increase with age, although that may be due to sampling of those who have presented with depressive conditions. It is now recognised that patients' understanding of depression and beliefs about its appropriate treatment, mental health literacy, influences treatment-seeking behaviour. Objectives This study delineates depression, recent use of health services and mental health literacy in a random and representative community sample of younger and older South Australians.
   Methods Depression, health service utilisation and mental health literacy were assessed in a random and representative sample of 2010 South Australians.
   Results for those aged between 65 and 74 years (n = 300) and those aged 15 to 24 years (n = 521) were compared. Results Compared with the younger group, older subjects did not report greater levels of current depression although they were more likely to have seen a medical practitioner in the last 12 months and be taking antidepressants. However, their mental health literacy in terms of recognition of a mental health problem in a vignette was somewhat poorer and fewer recommended treatment from a counsellor, telephone service or psychologist and more considered that a psychiatrist would be harmful. They also more often perceived the clergy as helpful.
   Conclusions Depression was not more common among older than younger members of the community. Despite recognising depression in a vignette less often and perceiving less likelihood of help from several different mental health professionals, those in the older group were more likely to receive antidepressant medication and to have recently consulted a medical practitioner.

AB The selection of pharmacotherapy for patients with allergic rhinitis aims to control the disease and depends on many factors. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines have considerably improved the treatment of allergic rhinitis. However, there is an increasing trend toward use of real-world evidence to inform clinical practice, especially because randomized controlled trials are often limited with regard to the applicability of results. The Contre les Maladies Chroniques pour un Vieillissement Actif (MACVIA) algorithm has proposed an allergic rhinitis treatment by a consensus group. This simple algorithm can be used to step up or step down allergic rhinitis treatment. Next-generation guidelines for the pharmacologic treatment of allergic rhinitis were developed by using existing GRADE-based guidelines for the disease, real-world evidence provided by mobile technology, and additive studies (allergen chamber studies) to refine the MACVIA algorithm.

AB Background: Cognitive impairment is common in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Subtle changes can impact engagement with healthcare, comprehension, decision-making, and medication adherence. We aimed to systematically summarise evidence of cognitive changes in CKD.
   Methods: We searched MEDLINE (March 2016) for cross-sectional, cohort or randomised studies that measured cognitive function in people with CKD (PROSPERO, registration number CRD42014015226). The CKD population included people with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), not receiving renal replacement therapy, in any research setting. We conducted a meta-analysis using random effects, expressed as standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Outcomes were performance in eight cognitive domains. Bias was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).
   Results: We identified 44 studies reporting sufficient data for synthesis (51,575 participants). Mean NOS score for cohort studies was 5.8/9 and for cross-sectional 5.4/10. Studies were deficient in NOS outcome and selection due to poor methods reporting and in comparison group validity of demographics and chronic disease status. CKD patients (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) performed worse than control groups (eGFR >= 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) on Orientation & Attention (SMD -0.79, 95% CI, -1.44 to -0.13), Language (SMD -0.63, 95% CI, -0.85 to -0.41), Concept Formation & Reasoning (SMD -0.63, 95% CI, -1.07 to -0.18), Executive Function (SMD -0.53, 95% CI, -0.85 to -0.21), Memory (SMD -0.48, 95% CI, -0.79 to -0.18), and Global Cognition (SMD -0.48, 95% CI, -0.72 to -0.24). Construction & Motor Praxis and Perception were unaffected (SMD -0.29, 95% CI, -0.90 to 0.32; SMD -1.12, 95% CI, -4.35 to 2.12). Language scores dropped with eGFR (< 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 SMD -0.86, 95% CI, -1.25 to -46; 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) SMD -1.56, 95% CI, -2.27 to -0.84). Differences in Orientation & Attention were greatest at eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (SMD -4.62, 95% CI, -4.68 to -4.55). Concept Formation & Reasoning differences were greatest at eGFR < 45 mL/min/ 1.73 m(2) (SMD -4.27, 95% CI, -4.23 to -4.27). Differences in Executive Functions were greatest at eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (SMD -0.54, 95% CI, -1.00 to -0.08).
   Conclusions: Cognitive changes occur early in CKD, and skills decline at different rates. Orientation & Attention and Language are particularly affected. The cognitive impact of CKD is likely to diminish patients' capacity to engage with healthcare decisions. An individual's cognitive trajectory may deviate from average.

TI Peer Support for the Hardly Reached: A Systematic Review

AB Background. Health disparities are aggravated when prevention and care initiatives fail to reach those they are intended to help. Groups can be classified as hardly reached according to a variety of circumstances that fall into 3 domains: individual (e.g., psychological factors), demographic (e.g., socioeconomic status), and cultural-environmental (e.g., social network). Several reports have indicated that peer support is an effective means of reaching hardly reached individuals. However, no review has explored peer support effectiveness in relation to the circumstances associated with being hardly reached or across diverse health problems.
   Objectives. To conduct a systematic review assessing the reach and effectiveness of peer support among hardly reached individuals, as well as peer support strategies used.
   Search methods. Three systematic searches conducted in PubMed identified studies that evaluated peer support programs among hardly reached individuals. In aggregate, the searches covered articles published from 2000 to 2015.
   Selection criteria. Eligible interventions provided ongoing support for complex health behaviors, including prioritization of hardly reached populations, assistance in applying behavior change plans, and social-emotional support directed toward disease management or quality of life. Studies were excluded if they addressed temporally isolated behaviors, were limited to protocol group classes, included peer support as the dependent variable, did not include statistical tests of significance, or incorporated comparison conditions that provided appreciable social support.
   Data collection and analysis. We abstracted data regarding the primary health topic, categorizations of hardly reached groups, program reach, outcomes, and strategies employed. We conducted a 2-sample t test to determine whether reported strategies were related to reach.
   Results. Forty-seven studies met our inclusion criteria, and these studies represented each of the 3 domains of circumstances assessed (individual, demographic, and cultural-environmental). Interventions addressed 8 health areas, most commonly maternal and child health (25.5%), diabetes (17.0%), and other chronic diseases (14.9%). Thirty-six studies (76.6%) assessed program reach, which ranged from 24% to 79% of the study population. Forty-four studies (94%) reported significant changes favoring peer support. Eleven strategies emerged for engaging and retaining hardly reached individuals. Among them, programs that reported a strategy of trust and respect had higher participant retention (82.8%) than did programs not reporting such a strategy (48.1%; P = .003). In 5 of the 6 studies examining moderators of the effects of peer support, peer support benefits were greater among individuals characterized by disadvantage (e.g., low health literacy).
   Conclusions. Peer support is a broad and robust strategy for reaching groups that health services too often fail to engage. The wide range of audiences and health concerns among which peer support is successful suggests that a basis for its success may be its flexible response to different contexts, including the intended audience, health problems, and setting.
   Public health implications. The general benefits of peer support and findings suggesting that it may be more effective among those at heightened disadvantage indicate that peer support should be considered in programs intended to reach and benefit those too often hardly reached. Because engendering trust and respect was significantly associated with participant retention, programs should emphasize this strategy.

AB Background: The provision of health education involving self-care and good adherence to medications has been acknowledged to be a cost effective strategy for improving quality of life of diabetes patients. We assessed levels of knowledge about type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), self-care behaviours and adherence to medication among DM patients.
   Methods: A facility based cross-sectional survey of 325 adults with T2DM patients attending Jimma University Teaching Hospital, Southwest Ethiopia was conducted. We used diabetes Knowledge Test, Expanded Version of the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities and Morisky 8-Item medication adherence as tools to measure diabetic knowledge, self-care behaviours and adherence to medications respectively. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to assess the independent predictors of diabetes knowledge and adherence to medications. The binary logistic regression was applied for self-care behaviours.
   Results: 309 respondents were included in the survey. Of all the respondents, 44.9 %, 20.1 % and 34.9 % had low, medium and high level diabetic knowledge respectively. High level of diabetic knowledge was the reference group. Being illiterate (AOR = 3.1, 95%CI: 1.03-9.3), having BMI < 18 kg/m(2) (AOR = 6.4, 95%CI: 1.2-34.9) and duration of DM < 5 years (AOR = 4.2, 95%CI: 1.9-9.5) were significantly associated with low level of diabetic knowledge. T2DM patients who practiced good self-care (AOR = 0.5, 95%CI: 0.3-0.9) were less likely to have low knowledge. Duration of DM < 5 years (AOR = 9.8, 95%CI: 3.2-30.2) was significantly associated with medium level of diabetic knowledge. 157(50.8 %) patients had poor self-care behaviour and this was associated with level of education and adherence to medication. The proportions of patients with low, medium and high adherence to medication were 24.9 %, 37.9 % and 37.2 % respectively. Being a merchant, having medium level of diabetic knowledge and having good glycemic control level were associated with low adherence to medications.
   Conclusions: Significant number of DM patients had low level of knowledge, poor self-care behaviours and low level of adherence to medications. These findings call for the need of integrated interventional management on diabetic knowledge, self-care behaviours and adherence to medications. To ensure effective T2DM management, a strategic approach that improves health literacy could be a cross cutting intervention.

AB Background: Inadequate health literacy affects more than 90 million Americans and it has been associated with adverse outcomes in the medicine field including increased hospitalization rates and greater mortality. Since surgical patients are often required to make complex decisions and adhere to complex instructions, health literacy may have a profound impact in the surgical practice. The main objective of the current study was to systematically evaluate the role of health literacy in surgical patients.
   Methods: A systematic search was performed to identify studies that evaluated the role of health literacy in the perioperative setting following the PRISMA guidelines. Only studies that examined health literacy using a validated instrument in the perioperative setting were included.
   Results: Ten studies including data on 1147 patients were included. The median (IQR) number of patients in the included studies was 101 (30 to 152). The majority of studies used the Short Test of Functional Literacy in adults (STOFHLA) to evaluate patients' health literacy. Five studies evaluated the patients preoperatively, four studies evaluated patients in the postoperative period and in one study the time of evaluation in relation to the surgical procedure was not defined. The lowest prevalence of inadequate health literacy was detected in kidney transplant patients, 6 out of 124 (5 %), while the highest prevalence of inadequate health literacy was detected in orthopedic patients having total joint replacement, 86 out of 126 (60 %). Inadequate health literacy in the preoperative period was associated with poor medical information comprehension and it may adversely affect adherence to preoperative medications and even modulate surgical disparities. Inadequate health literacy in the postoperative period was associated with poor comprehension of discharge instructions and worse kidney function in transplant recipients.
   Conclusions: Health literacy seems to have a very significant impact in the care of surgical patients. More studies to establish the impact of poor health literacy on perioperative outcomes are needed.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Parents (n = 11,845) completed the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (or its latest revision) at pediatric visits. Using sociodemographic predictors of maternal education and race, binary logistic regressions were utilized to examine differences in autism screening, diagnostic evaluation participation rates and outcomes, and reasons for non-participation. Families of lower maternal education and racial minorities exhibited inflated initial screen positive rates and lower participation at Follow-Up, although not at the evaluation. Economic challenges, such as invalid phone numbers, were identified as barriers to reaching these families. Families of higher education and White race were more likely to decline participation in evaluation. Results suggest the need for increased public education about childhood development to enhance awareness, reduce stigma, and streamline screening.

AB OBJECTIVE
   To investigate the geographic variation in diabetes prevalence and detection in China.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
   Self-report and biomedical data were collected from 98,058 adults aged >= 18 years (90.5% response) from 162 areas spanning mainland China. Diabetes status was assessed using American Diabetes Association criteria. Among those with diabetes, detection was defined by prior diagnosis. Choropleth maps were used to visually assess geographical variation in each outcome at the provincial level. The odds of each outcome were assessed using multilevel logistic regression, with adjustment for person-and area-level characteristics.
   RESULTS
   Geographic visualization at the provincial level indicated widespread variation in diabetes prevalence and detection across China. Regional prevalence adjusted for age, sex, and urban/rural socioeconomic circumstances (SECs) ranged from 8.3% (95% CI 7.2%, 9.7%) in the northeast to 12.7% (11.1%, 14.6%) in the north. A clear negative gradient in diabetes prevalence was observed from 13.1%(12.0%, 14.4%) in the urban high-SEC to 8.7% (7.8%, 9.6%) in rural low-SEC counties/districts. Adjusting for health literacy and other person-level characteristics only partially attenuated these geographic variations. Only one-third of participants living with diabetes had been previously diagnosed, but this also varied substantively by geography. Regional detection adjusted for age, sex, and urban/rural SEC, for example, spanned from 40.4% (34.9%, 46.3%) in the north to 15.6% (11.7%, 20.5%) in the southwest. Compared with detection of 40.8% (37.3%, 44.4%) in urban high-SEC counties, detection was poorest among rural low-SEC counties at just 20.5% (17.7%, 23.7%). Person-level characteristics did not fully account for these geographic variations in diabetes detection.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Strategies for addressing diabetes risk and improving detection require geographical targeting.

AB Background: Enhancement of mental health literacy for youth is a focus of increasing interest for mental health professionals and educators alike. Schools are an ideal site for addressing mental health literacy in young people. Currently, there is limited evidence regarding the impact of curriculum-based interventions within high school settings. We examined the effect of a high-school mental health curriculum (The Guide) in enhancing mental health literacy in Canadian schools.
   Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis on surveys of students who participated in a classroom mental health course taught by their usual teachers. Evaluation of students' mental health literacy (knowledge/attitudes) was completed before and after classroom implementation and at 2-month follow-up. We used paired-samples t-tests and Cohen's d value to determine the significance and impact of change.
   Results: There were 265 students who completed all surveys. Students' knowledge significantly improved between pre- and post-tests (p < 0.001; d = 0.90) and was maintained at follow-up (p < 0.001; d = 0.73). Similarly, attitude significantly improved between pre- and post-tests (p < 0.001; d = 0.25) and was significantly higher at follow-up than base-line (p < 0.007; d = 0.18)
   Conclusions: The Guide, applied by usual teachers in usual classroom curriculum, may help improve student knowledge and attitudes regarding mental health. This is the first study to demonstrate the positive impact of a curriculum-based mental health literacy program in a Canadian high school population.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the independent effects of socioeconomic and psychological social determinants of health on diabetes knowledge, self-care, diabetes outcomes and quality of life.
   Research design and methods: Cross-sectional sample of 615 adults from two adult primary care clinics in the southeastern United States. Primary outcome variables were diabetes knowledge, self-care behaviors (diet, exercise, medication adherence, blood sugar testing, foot care) and diabetes outcomes (HbA1c, low-density lipoprotein, blood pressure, physical component summary score of SF12 quality of life, mental component summary score of SF12 quality of life). Covariates included age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, health literacy and comorbidity. Linear regression models were used to assess independent associations controlling for covariates.
   Results: In final adjusted models, significant associations for HbA1c included education [beta=-0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.36 to -0.08], income (beta=-0.66, CI: -1.30 to -0.16), self-efficacy (beta=-0.12, CI: -0.15 to -0.08) and diabetes distress (beta=0.43, CI: 0.14 to 0.72). Significant associations for self-care included medication adherence with diabetes distress (beta=-0.58, CI: -0.91 to -0.25) and perceived stress (beta=-0.12, CI: -0.18 to -0.05) and exercise with depression (beta=-0.06, CI: -0.10 to-0.01) and self-efficacy (beta=0.06, CI: 0.01 to 0.10). Significant associations for quality of life included depression (beta=-0.08, CI: -0.12 to -0.03), serious psychological distress (beta=-0.09, CI: -0.12 to -0.05), social support (beta=0.01, CI: 0.001 to 0.02) and perceived stress (beta=-0.12, CI: -0.19 to -0.06).
   Conclusions: Social determinants of health were significantly associated with diabetes self-care and outcomes with socioeconomic factors being most often associated with diabetes outcomes and psychological factors, specifically self-efficacy and perceived stress being most often associated with self-care and quality of life.

AB Objective. Healthcare reforms in the United States, including the Affordable Care and HITECH Acts, and the NCQA criteria for the Patient Centered Medical Home have promoted health information technology (HIT) and the integration of general medical and mental health services. These developments, which aim to improve chronic disease care, have largely occurred in parallel, with little attention to the need for coordination. In this article, the fundamental connections between HIT and improvements in chronic disease management are explored. We use the evidence-based collaborative care model as an example, with attention to health literacy improvement for supporting patient engagement in care.
   Method. A review of the literature was conducted to identify how HIT and collaborative care, an evidence-based model of chronic disease care, support each other.
   Results. Five key principles of effective collaborative care are outlined: care is patient-centered, evidence-based, measurement-based, population-based, and accountable. The potential role of HIT in implementing each principle is discussed. Key features of the mobile health paradigm are described, including how they can extend evidence-based treatment beyond traditional clinical settings.
   Conclusion. HIT, and particularly mobile health, can enhance collaborative care interventions, and thus improve the health of individuals and populations when deployed in integrated delivery systems (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study was to translate the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) into German, to evaluate this translation through psychometric testing in a German sample of adolescents, and to analyze whether the content-derived hypothesis of two eHEALS subscales was confirmed by the data. We hypothesized that the first subscale would cover self-perceived competence in seeking health information online, and the second subscale information appraisal of health information on the Internet. A cross-sectional survey among 18-year-old students (N = 327) using our translation of the eHEALS was conducted. A confirmatory factor analysis compared the 1-factor model based on Norman and Skinners' analyses with the a priori specified 2-factor model. The results indicated a better fit for the 2-factor model (chi-square difference of 150.93, p <.0001), supporting the division into subscales.

AB Objective: To identify changes in the prevalence of major depression between 1998, 2004 and 2008 in South Australia.
   Methods: Face-to-face Health Omnibus surveys were conducted in 1998, 2004 and 2008 with approximately 3000 participants aged 15 years and over, who were random and representative samples of the South Australian population. Each survey used the same methodology. Outcome measures were: major depression as detected by the Mood module of the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders instrument; mental health literacy by recognition and exposure to classical symptoms of depression; and health status using the SF-36 Physical and Mental Component summaries.
   Results: There was a significant increase in the prevalence of major depression from 6.8% (95%CI: 5.9%-7.7%) to 10.3% (95%CI: 9.2%-11.4%; chi(2) 24.59, p < 0.001) between 1998 and 2008. Significant increases were observed in males aged 15-29 and females aged 30-49 years. There was no significant increase in any other sub-group. The strongest predictor of major depression was health status. Participants with poor/fair mental health literacy were 37% less likely to be classified with major depression.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of major depression increased significantly in South Australia over the last decade and there was a reduction in mental health status and an increase in persons reporting poor health. Unexpectedly, having poor or fair mental health literacy was significantly protective for major depression. Ideally, public health initiatives should result in an improvement in health, but this did not appear to have occurred here.

AB Introduction
   The objective of this cross-sectional study was to examine the nutrition literacy status of adults in the Lower Mississippi Delta.
   Methods
   Survey instruments included the Newest Vital Sign and an adapted version of the Health Information National Trends Survey. A proportional quota sampling plan was used to represent educational achievement of residents in the Delta region. Participants included 177 adults, primarily African Americans (81%). Descriptive statistics, X-2 analysis, analysis of variance, and multivariate analysis of covariance tests were used to examine survey data.
   Results
   Results indicated that 24% of participants had a high likelihood of limited nutrition literacy, 28% had a possibility of limited nutrition literacy, and 48% had adequate nutrition literacy. Controlling for income and education level, the multivariate analysis of covariance models revealed that nutrition literacy was significantly associated with media use for general purposes (F = 2.79, P = .005), media use for nutrition information (F = 2.30, P = .04), and level of trust from nutrition sources (F = 2.29, P = .005). Overall, the Internet was the least trusted and least used source for nutrition information. Only 12% of participants correctly identified the 2005 MyPyramid graphic, and the majority (78%) rated their dietary knowledge as poor or fair.
   Conclusion
   Compared with other national surveys, rates of limited health literacy among Delta adults were high. Nutrition literacy status has implications for how people seek nutrition information and how much they trust it. Understanding the causes and consequences of limited nutrition literacy may be a step toward reducing the burden of nutrition-related chronic diseases among disadvantaged rural communities.

AB Asthma 1-2-3 is a newly-developed low-literacy multimedia education tool designed to promote asthma self-care concepts among African American adults. An expert panel (n = 10) informed content development for the tool. The video script and storyboard imagery were shown to 30 African Americans recruited from the American Lung Association, whose reactions and comments guided further revisions. The final version was pilot tested in three diverse community settings in Chicago to determine the efficacy of Asthma 1-2-3 at improving patient understanding of asthma and its symptoms. In all, 130 adults participated in the pilot test. Knowledge scores significantly improved from pretest to posttest following presentation of the developed tool for subjects across all literacy levels (Pretest: Mean = 4.2 [SD = 1.6]; Posttest: M = 6.8 [SD = 2.0], P < 0.001). Symptom pathophysiology concepts were the least understood. Individuals with low literacy had less total knowledge score gains compared to those with marginal and adequate literacy (1.8, 2.6, and 3.2 respectively; P = 0.002). The multimedia tool significantly improved understanding of asthma. Individuals with limited literacy may require additional instruction, repeated viewing, or added tangible cues (i.e. supplementary print materials) to support knowledge retention. In general, feedback from the target population was particularly helpful in the development of the tool and its initial evaluation, and should be considered as a necessary step in the creation of other patient education materials.

AB Genetic information presents challenges to all patients, but particularly those with low and marginal literacy. The goal of the study was to create a rapid estimate of adult literacy in genetics (REAL-G) too], with established validity, for use with patients receiving genetics services. Patterned after the widely used rapid estimate of adult literacy in medicine (REALM), a three-stage method was used in tool development. This included derivation of terms from transcripts of visits conducted by over 150 prenatal and cancer genetic counselors. Concurrent validity was estimated by administration of both the REAL-G and the REALM to 203 participants. Predictive validity was estimated by relating participants' REAL-G scores to scores on a learning task that involved viewing a videotaped genetic counseling session and answering related questions. The REAL-G measure was strongly correlated with the REALM (Pearson correlation =0.83; P<0.0001), indicating substantial concurrent validity in a population of potential genetic counseling patients. Using the REALM as the gold standard, REAL-G scores identified readers at the sixth grade level or below (95.4% sensitivity and 88.5% specificity). Further analysis identified an eight-item subset of words that has strong concurrent validity when compared to longer instruments and even greater predictive power in relation to information recall. Subjects scoring below the sixth grade level on the eight-item REAL-G scored significantly lower than others on knowledge tests after viewing genetic counseling visits. The REAL-G represents a screening tool that can be used to quickly identify low literate patients in the clinical genetics context or to quantify context-specific literacy within a research setting.

AB Objective The objectives of the study are ( 1) to assess the mental health literacy of mental health professionals, ( 2) to determine whether there is agreement between different professional groups with respect to different psychopathological conditions and ( 3) to compare the professionals' knowledge with that of the general population.
   Methods Two representative samples of mental health professionals and laypersons were presented with a vignette depicting either a person with schizophrenia, major depression or without any psychiatric symptoms (` non- case'). Out of 18 treatment proposals, the respondents were asked to indicate the proposals regarded as helpful and those considered as being harmful, respectively, for the person depicted.
   Results Mental health professionals view their profession and less often their treatment methods as helpful. Dealing with the situation alone, electroconvulsive therapy, hypnotics and sedatives are consistently regarded as harmful. For the individual with schizophrenia, mental health professionals agree about helpful treatments. Regarding depression, a lack of consensus is found about treatment proposals such as psychiatric hospitalisation, antidepressants and complementary and alternative medicine. An important part of mental health professionals suggests medical help ( psychologists and general practitioners) for the non- case vignette. Fewer nurses, social workers, vocational workers and occupational therapists (` other therapists') as compared to psychiatrists and psychologists recommend standard treatment methods. Professionals and the general population significantly differ in their attitudes towards the treatment suggestions, especially regarding medication and alternative medicine.
   Conclusions To improve the treatment of mental disorders, various strategies must be considered. These include permanent education of all mental health professionals, especially nurses and other therapists. A special focus must be given to affective disorders and a potential ( over-) treatment of normal behaviour.

SO OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY

DT Article
ID FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY; READABILITY; INSTRUCTIONS
AB Objective: To examine the relationship between reading ability and family planning knowledge and practices among Medicaid managed care enrollees.
   Methods: A total of 406 women age 19-45 years enrolled in TennCare and members of Prudential HealthCare Community Plan in Memphis, Tennessee were interviewed to determine their methods of contraception, desire for additional information about contraceptives, and knowledge about the time in menstrual cycle they are at highest risk for pregnancy. Patient reading ability was assessed by an abbreviated version of the Test of Functional Health Literacy of Adults. The independent associations between reading ability, desire for additional contraceptive information, and knowledge about the highest risk time for pregnancy were assessed with logistic regression.
   Results: Almost 10% of the respondents had low reading skills. Women who had used an intrauterine device, douching, rhythm, or levonorgestrel implants as methods of birth control had higher rates of low reading skills than women who used other methods of birth control. Compared with women with good reading skills, women with low reading skills were 2.2 times (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1, 4.4) more likely to want to know more about birth control methods and 4.4 times (95% CI 2.2, 9.0) more likely to have incorrect knowledge about when they were most likely to get pregnant. These relationships were significant even after controlling for age, race, and marital status.
   Conclusion: Health providers and organizations that serve historically underserved populations must understand that some individuals have a low level of reading ability that limits family planning education.

ID FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY; LANGUAGE TRANSLATION; INSTRUMENT
AB OBJECTIVES. The authors examine the reliability and validity of English and Spanish versions of a patient satisfaction measure, the Interpersonal Aspects of Care (IAC) Examiner Scale.
   METHODS. The examiner scale was administered to 234 Spanish-speaking and 250 English-speaking patients seen in the emergency department of a large public hospital. Reliability and validity coefficients were calculated for both administrations. Differences in item and scale response distributions were compared using two methods of response dichotomization.
   RESULTS. In general, the examiner scale was reliable and valid. However, the Spanish version of the scale was significantly less reliable and valid. Depending on the method of item response dichotomization, significant differences between Spanish-speaking and English-speaking patients were found for the majority of the individual scale items. This was due primarily to a tendency for Spanish-speaking patients to respond "good" to items more frequently than did English-speaking patients.
   CONCLUSIONs. The results bring into question the use of certain types of response formats and the practice of dichotomizing responses when evaluating patient satisfaction in Spanish-speaking patients.

AB Background and objectives The self-management and decision-making skills required to manage CKD successfully may be diminished in those with low health literacy. A 2012 review identified five papers reporting the prevalence of limited health literacy in CKD, largely from United States dialysis populations. The literature has expanded considerably since.
   Design, setting, participants, & measurements We used systematic review, pooled prevalence analysis, metaregression, and exploration of heterogeneity in studies of patients with CKD (all stages).
   Results From 433 studies, 15 new studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed together with five studies from the 2012 review. These included 13 cross-sectional surveys, five cohort studies (using baseline data), and two using baseline clinical trial data. Most (19 of 20) were from the United States. In total, 12,324 patients were studied (3529 nondialysis CKD, 5289 dialysis, 2560 transplant, and 946 with unspecified CKD; median =198.5; IQR, 128.5-260 per study). Median prevalence of limited health literacy within studies was 23% (IQR, 16%-33%), and pooled prevalence was 25% (95% confidence interval, 20% to 30%) with significant between-study heterogeneity (I-2=97%). Pooled prevalence of limited health literacy was 25% (95% confidence interval, 16% to 33%;1z=97%) among patients with CKD not on dialysis, 27% (95% confidence interval, 19% to 35%; I-2=96%) among patients on dialysis, and 14% (95% confidence interval, 7% to 21%; I-2=97%) among patients with transplants. A higher proportion of nonwhite participants was associated with increased limited health literacy prevalence (P=0.04), but participant age was not (P=0.40). Within studies, nonwhite ethnicity and low socioeconomic status were consistently and independently associated with limited health literacy. Studies were of low or moderate quality. Within-study participant selection criteria had potential to introduce bias.
   Conclusions Limited health literacy is common in CKD, especially among individuals with low socioeconomic status and nonwhite ethnicity. This has implications for the design of self-management and decision-making initiatives to promote equity of care and improve quality. Lower prevalence among patients with transplants may reflect selection of patients with higher health literacy for transplantation either because of less comorbidity in this group or as a direct effect of health literacy on access to transplantation.

AB BACKGROUND: Environmental health literacy (EHL) is coalescing into a new subdiscipline that combines key principles and procedural elements from the fields of risk communication, health literacy, environmental health sciences (EHS), communications research, and safety culture. These disciplines have contributed unique expertise and perspectives to the development of EHL. Since 1992, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) has contributed to the evolution of EHL and now seeks to stimulate its scientific advancement and rigor.
   OBJECTIVES: The principal objective of this article is to stimulate a conversation on, and advance research in, EHL.
   DISCUSSION: In this article, we propose a definition of and conceptual framework for EHL, describe EHL in its social and historical context, identify the complementary fields and domains where EHL is being defined and implemented, and outline a research agenda. Extensive reviews of web and literature searches indicate that the concept of EHL is evolving rapidly, as are the definitions of its scope and inquiry. Although several authors have outlined different frameworks, we believe that a more nuanced model based on Bloom's taxonomy is better suited to EHL and to future research in this area.
   CONCLUSIONS: We posit that EHL can potentially benefit the conduct and outcomes of community-engaged and health disparities EHS research and can ensure that the translation of research findings will lead to greater understanding of specific risks, reduction of exposures, and improvement of health outcomes for individuals and communities. We provide four recommendations to advance work in EHL.

ID COMMUNICATION
AB Objective To collaborate with community members to develop tailored infographics that support comprehension of health information, engage the viewer, and may have the potential to motivate health-promoting behaviors.
   Methods The authors conducted participatory design sessions with community members, who were purposively sampled and grouped by preferred language (English, Spanish), age group (18-30, 31-60, >60 years), and level of health literacy (adequate, marginal, inadequate). Research staff elicited perceived meaning of each infographic, preferences between infographics, suggestions for improvement, and whether or not the infographics would motivate health-promoting behavior. Analysis and infographic refinement were iterative and concurrent with data collection.
   Results Successful designs were information-rich, supported comparison, provided context, and/or employed familiar color and symbolic analogies. Infographics that employed repeated icons to represent multiple instances of a more general class of things (e.g., apple icons to represent fruit servings) were interpreted in a rigidly literal fashion and thus were unsuitable for this community. Preliminary findings suggest that infographics may motivate health-promoting behaviors. Discussion Infographics should be information-rich, contextualize the information for the viewer, and yield an accurate meaning even if interpreted literally.
   Conclusion Carefully designed infographics can be useful tools to support comprehension and thus help patients engage with their own health data. Infographics may contribute to patients' ability to participate in the Learning Health System through participation in the development of a robust data utility, use of clinical communication tools for health self-management, and involvement in building knowledge through patient-reported outcomes.

AB Background The term 'Patient Empowerment' (PE) is a growing concept - so in popularity as in application - covering situations where citizens are encouraged to take an active role in the management of their own health. This concept is serving as engine power for increasing the quality of health systems, but a question is still unanswered, 'how PE will be effectively achieved?' Beyond psychological implications, empowerment of patients in daily practice relies on technology and the way it is used. Unfortunately, the heterogeneity of approaches and technologies makes difficult to have a global vision of how PE is being performed.
   Objective To clarify how technology is being applied for enhancing patient empowerment as well as to identify current (and future) trends and milestones in this issue.
   Search strategy Searches for relevant English language articles using Medline, Scopus, ACM Digital Library, Springer Link, EB-SCO host and ScienceDirect databases from the year 2000 until October 2012 were conducted. Among others, a selection criterion was to review articles including terms 'patient' and 'empowerment' in title, abstract or as keywords.
   Main results and conclusions Results state that practical approaches to empower patients vary in scope, aim and technology. Health literacy of patients, remote access to health services, and self-care mechanisms are the most valued ways to accomplish PE. Current technology already allows establishing the first steps in the road ahead, but a change of attitude by all stakeholders (i.e. professionals, patients, policy makers, etc.) is required.

AB Objective: To examine the relationship between health literacy (HL), health information access, health behavior, and health status in Japanese people.
   Methods: A questionnaire survey was conducted at six healthcare facilities in Japan. Eligible respondents aged 20-64 years (n = 1218) were included. Path analysis with structural equation modeling was performed to test the hypothesis model linking HL to health information access, health behavior, and health status.
   Results: The acceptable fitting model indicated that the pathways linking HL to health status consisted of two indirect,paths; one intermediated by health information access and another intermediated by health behavior. Those with higher HL as measured by the 14-item Health Literacy Scale (HLS-14) were significantly more likely to get sufficient health information from multiple sources, less likely to have risky habits of smoking, regular drinking, and lack of exercise, and in turn, more likely to report good self-rated health.
   Conclusion: HL was significantly associated with health information access and health behavior in Japanese people. HL may play a key role in health promotion, even in highly educated countries like Japan.
   Practice implications: In order to enhance the effects of health promotion interventions, health professionals should aim at raising HL levels of their target population groups. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Research has consistently identified a disparity between the prevalence of mental health concerns among young adults and their rates of formal help seeking. However, a few randomised controlled trials have identified effective interventions for increasing formal help seeking among young adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief online psychoeducational intervention, targeting depression, anxiety and suicide stigma, for increasing positive attitudes towards help seeking and increasing help seeking intentions among young adults.
   Method: The study followed a single-blind parallel group randomized controlled trial design with 67 young adult (18-25 years) Australian participants, assigned to receive online psychoeducation (n=33) or online attention-matched control information (n=34) over 3 weeks. Participants in the experimental group received information on depression, anxiety, and suicide. The control group received information unrelated to mental health. Primary outcome measures were mental health literacy, mental illness stigma, attitudes toward professional help seeking and intentions to seek help. Secondary outcome variables were symptomology, satisfaction and adherence.
   Results: Significant between-group differences were found for the pre- to post-Lest, including increased anxiety literacy (Cohen's d = 0.65), decreased depression stigma (d=0.53), and increased help seeking attitudes and intentions for the experimental group (d=0.58 and d=0.53, respectively).
   Limitations: Due to the small sample size and homogenous nature of the sample, generalisations should be made with caution.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates the utility and effectiveness of a brief online psychoeducation intervention for promoting help seeking among young adults. (C) 2014 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

AB Evidence suggests that poor mental health literacy is a key barrier to help-seeking for mental health difficulties in adolescence. Educational programs have shown positive effects on literacy, however, the evidence base remains limited and available studies have many methodological limitations. Using cluster Randomised Control Trial (RCT) methodology, the current study examines the impact of 'HeadStrong', a school-based educational intervention, on mental health literacy, stigma, help-seeking, psychological distress and suicidal ideation. A total of 380 students in 22 classes (clusters) from 10 non-government secondary schools was randomised to receive either HeadStrong or Personal Development, Health and Physical Education (PDHPE) classes. Participants were assessed pre- and post-intervention, and at 6-month follow-up. Literacy improved and stigma reduced in both groups at post-intervention and follow-up, relative to baseline. However, these effects were significantly greater in the HeadStrong condition. The study demonstrates the potential of HeadStrong to improve mental health literacy and reduce stigma.

AB Mobile phone technologies have been hailed as a promising means for delivering mental health interventions to youth and adolescents, the age group with high cell phone penetration and with the onset of 75% of all lifetime mental disorders. Despite the growing evidence in physical health and adult mental health, however, little information is available about how mobile phones are implemented to deliver mental health services to the younger population. The purpose of this scoping study was to map the current state of knowledge regarding mobile mental health (mMental Health) for young people (age 13-24 years), identify gaps, and consider implications for future research. Seventeen articles that met the inclusion criteria provided evidence for mobile phones as a way to engage youth in therapeutic activities. The flexibility, interactivity, and spontaneous nature of mobile communications were also considered advantageous in encouraging persistent and continual access to care outside clinical settings. Four gaps in current knowledge were identified: the scarcity of studies conducted in low and middle income countries, the absence of information about the real-life feasibility of mobile tools, the need to address the issue of technical and health literacy of both young users and health professionals, and the need for critical discussion regarding diverse ethical issues associated with mobile phone use. We suggest that mMental Health researchers and clinicians should carefully consider the ethical issues related to patient-practitioner relationship, best practices, and the logic of self-surveillance.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to develop scales to assess mental health literacy relating to affective disorders, anxiety disorders and schizophrenia/psychosis.
   Method: Scales were created to assess mental health literacy in relation to depression, depression with suicidal thoughts, early schizophrenia, chronic schizophrenia, social phobia and post-traumatic stress disorder using data from a survey of 1536 health professionals (general practitioners, clinical psychologists and psychiatrists), assessing recognition of these disorders and beliefs about the helpfulness of interventions. This was done by using the consensus of experts about the helpfulness and harmfulness of treatments for each disorder as a criterion. Data from a general population survey of 6019 Australians aged 15 was used to examine associations between scale scores, exposure to mental disorders and sociodemographic variables, to assess scale validity.
   Results: Those with a close friend or family member with a mental disorder had significantly higher mean scores on all mental health literacy scales, providing support for scale validity. Personal experience of the problem and working with people with a similar problem was linked to higher scores on some scales. Male sex, a lower level of education and age > 60 were linked to lower levels of mental health literacy. Higher scores were also linked to a greater belief that people with mental disorders are sick rather than weak.
   Conclusions: The scales developed in this study allow for the assessment of mental health literacy in relation to depression, depression with suicidal thoughts, early schizophrenia, chronic schizophrenia, social phobia and PTSD. Those with exposure to mental disorders had higher scores on the scales, and analyses of the links between scale scores and sociodemographic variables of age, gender and level of education were in line with those seen in other studies, providing support for scale validity.

AB Background: Among kidney transplant recipients, non-adherence with immunosuppressive medications frequently precedes allograft loss. We sought to determine the prevalence and correlates of medication non-adherence among kidney transplant recipients.
   Methods: We performed a single-center, cross-sectional study of kidney transplant recipients who were at least 6 months post-transplant. We measured self-reported adherence using the Immunosuppressive Therapy Adherence Scale (ITAS, which is scored from 0 to 12, where higher scores indicate increased adherence) and barriers to adherence using the Immunosuppressive Therapy Barriers Scale (ITBS). We also used validated scales to measure perceived stress, health literacy, anxiety, depression, and interpersonal support.
   Results: The 252 patients included in the study were 59.9% male, 27.0% Black, and at a median of 2.9 years post-transplant (interquartile range [IQR] 1.4-5.8). On the ITAS, 59.1% scored a perfect 12, 26.6% scored 10-11, and 14.3% scored 0-9. In univariate models, non-adherence (defined as ITAS score <= 9) was significantly associated with increased scores on scales for perceived stress (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.25) and depression (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02-1.28), and with more self-reported barriers to adherence on the ITBS (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.08-1.22). After adjusting for sociodemographic factors, stress and depression were not associated with non-adherence. Higher scores on the ITBS (corresponding to more self-described barriers to adherence) were associated with lower scores on the ITAS (P < 0.001). Several individual barriers were associated with non-adherence.
   Conclusions: Among prevalent kidney transplant recipients, a minority is non-adherent. Practical barriers to adherence may serve as promising targets for future interventions.

AB Objective: Assess the effects of personalised robot behaviours on the enjoyment and motivation of children (8-12) with diabetes, and on their acquisition of health knowledge, in educational play.
   Methods: Children (N = 5) played diabetes quizzes against a personal or neutral robot on three occasions: once at the clinic, twice at home. The personal robot asked them about their names, sports and favourite colours, referred to these data during the interaction, and engaged in small talk. Fun, motivation and diabetes knowledge was measured. Child-robot interaction was observed.
   Results: Children said the robot and quiz were fun, but this appreciation declined over time. With the personal robot, the children looked more at the robot and spoke more. The children mimicked the robot. Finally, an increase in knowledge about diabetes was observed.
   Conclusion: The study provides strong indication for how a personal robot can help children to improve health literacy in an enjoyable way. Children mimic the robot. When the robot is personal, they follow suit. Our results are positive and establish a good foundation for further development and testing in a larger study.
   Practice implications: Using a robot in health care could contribute to self-management in children and help them to cope with their illness. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Development and validation of a measure of health literacy in the UK:
   the newest vital sign
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Literacy; Health literacy; Nutrition label; Measure
ID KNOWLEDGE; INSTRUMENT; DELPHI; ADULTS; SKILLS
AB Background: Health literacy (HL) is an important public health issue. Current measures have drawbacks in length and/ or acceptability. The US-developed Newest Vital Sign (NVS) health literacy instrument measures both reading comprehension and numeracy skills using a nutrition label, takes 3 minutes to administer, and has proven to be acceptable to research subjects. This study aimed to amend and validate it for the UK population.
   Methods: We used a three-stage process; (1) a Delphi study with academic and clinical experts to amend the NVS label to reflect UK nutrition labeling (2) community-based cognitive testing to assess and improve ease of understanding and acceptability of the test (3) validation of the NVS-UK against an accepted standard test of health literacy, the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA) (Pearson's r and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve) and participant educational level. A sample size calculation indicated that 250 participants would be required. Inclusion criteria were age 18-75 years and ability to converse in English. We excluded people working in the health field and those with impaired vision or inability to undertake the interview due to cognitive impairment or inability to converse in English.
   Results: In the Delphi study, 28 experts reached consensus (3 cycles). Cognitive testing (80 participants) yielded an instrument that needed no further refinement. Validation testing (337 participants) showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's Alpha = 0.74). Validation against the TOFHLA demonstrated a Pearson's r of 0.49 and an area under the ROC curve of 0.81.
   Conclusions: The NVS-UK is a valid measure of HL. Its acceptability and ease of application makes it an ideal tool for use in the UK. It has potential uses in public health research including epidemiological surveys and randomized controlled trials, and in enabling practitioners to tailor care to patient need.

AB Objectives: This study was designed to develop a descriptive profile of parents and caregivers who bring their children to the emergency department (ED) for nonurgent issues and to explore the reasons for presenting to an urban hospital pediatric ED for nonurgent conditions. Such work is necessary to develop effective interventions.
   Methods: A total of 106 parents/caregivers whose child was triaged with a nonemergent/urgent condition completed a 15- to 20-minute computerized survey (English and Spanish) in an urban pediatric ED.
   Results: Most respondents described themselves as Latino (76%) and foreign born (62%). About one half (49%) reported having an annual income of less than $20,000, and 43% of respondents did not have health insurance for themselves. Almost all (95%) of the index children had a primary care physician and health insurance. Despite being triaged as nonurgent, more than one half (63%) described their child's condition as "very" or "extremely" urgent. About one half of the respondents reported not receiving basic information on childhood illnesses from their child's physician. Reasons for nonurgent visits seemed to revolve around issues of convenience and perception of quality of care.
   Conclusions: Interventions should focus on health literacy and ensure that parents are provided relevant and accurate education on pediatric illnesses and common safety concerns; by increasing parental education on pediatric health, parents may be better able to assess acuity of their child's health issues.

AB Mental disorders are common in young people, yet many do not seek help. The use of psychiatric labels to describe mental disorders is associated with effective help-seeking choices, and is promoted in community awareness initiatives designed to improve help-seeking. However these labels may also be coupled with stigmatizing beliefs and therefore inhibit help-seeking: lay mental health or non-specific labels may be less harmful. We examined the association between labeling of mental disorders and stigma in youth using data from a national telephone survey of 2802 Australians aged 12-25 years conducted from June 2006 to August 2006. Label use and stigmatizing beliefs were assessed in response to vignettes of a young person experiencing depression, psychosis or social phobia. Logistic regressions examined the association between a range of labels commonly used, including psychiatric labels, and a range of stigma components. There were no significant associations between label use and the stigma components of "stigma perceived in others", "reluctance to disclose" and for the most part "social distance". Most mental health labels were associated with seeing the person as "sick" rather than "weak" and accurate psychiatric labels had the strongest effect sizes. However, for the psychosis vignette, the "dangerous/unpredictable" component was predicted by the labels "schizophrenia/psychosis", "mental illness" and "psychological problem", and the accurate psychiatric label showed the strongest association. For all vignettes, generic lay labels were not associated with stigma, but also rarely had a counter stigma effect. These findings suggest that the use of accurate psychiatric labels by young people is seldom associated with stigma and may assist young people by reducing perceptions of weakness. However, community education that promotes accurate labeling of psychosis should proceed with caution and address beliefs about dangerousness and unpredictability. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Previous work has shown that there is a higher frequency of hospitalizations among black heart failure patients relative to white heart failure patients. We sought to determine whether racial differences exist in health literacy and access to outpatient medical care, and to identify factors associated with these differences.
   Methods: We evaluated data from 1464 heart failure patients (644 black and 820 white). Health literacy was assessed using the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine-Revised (ie, REALM-R), and access to care was assessed through participants' self-report.
   Results: Black race was strongly associated with worse health literacy and all measures of poor access to care in unadjusted analyses. After adjusting for demographics, noncardiac comorbidity, social support, insurance status, and socioeconomic status (income and education), the strongest associations were seen between race and: health literacy (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.46 to 3.10), absence of a medical home (OR 1.76, 1.19-2.61), and cost as a deterrent to seeking health care (OR 1.55, 1.07 to 2.23).
   Conclusions: Our findings highlight that important racial differences in health literacy and access to care exist among patients with heart failure. These differences persist even after adjustment for a broad range of potential mediators, including educational attainment, income, and insurance status. (J Cardiac Fail 2011;17:122-127)

AB Objective: Few studies have evaluated the end-of-life preferences of elderly patients in rural communities and whether preferences are associated with level of health literacy.
   Design: Randomized controlled trial of a goals-of-care video decision aid of advanced dementia.
   Participants: Elderly subjects (65 years or older) at a primary care clinic in rural Louisiana.
   Methods: Half of subjects heard a verbal description of advanced dementia and the goals of care; the other half heard the same verbal description and then viewed the video decision aid. End points were the preferred goal of care in advanced dementia: life-prolonging care (cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR], etc.), limited care (hospitalization but not CPR), or comfort care (symptom relief). The principal category for analysis was the difference in proportions of subjects preferring comfort care for each characteristic including randomization group and health literacy level.
   Results: Seventy-six subjects were randomized to the verbal (n = 43) or video (n = 33) arms of the study. Among subjects receiving the verbal description of advanced dementia and the goals of care, 31 (72%) preferred comfort; 5 (12%) chose limited; and 7 (16%) desired life-prolonging. In the video group, 30 (91%) preferred comfort; 3 (9%) chose limited; and none desired life-prolonging (chi(2) = 6.3, df = 2, p = 0.047). Factors associated with greater likelihood of opting for comfort included greater health literacy (unadjusted odds ratio [OR] 12.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4-62.6) and randomization to the video (unadjusted OR 3.9; 95% CI, 1.0-15.1).
   Conclusion: Rural subjects with higher health literacy were more likely to want comfort care compared to those with lower levels of health literacy. Furthermore, subjects who viewed a video decision aid were more likely to opt for comfort compared to those who solely listened to a verbal description. These findings suggest that video can help elicit preferences and that interventions to empower such patients need to be designed in a manner that is sensitive to health literacy.

ID KNOWLEDGE; CARE; RISK; PERCEPTION; WOMEN
AB Patients' health literacy is increasingly recognized as a critical factor affecting health communication and outcomes. We performed this study to assess the levels of health literacy by using Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) and Newest Vital Sign (NVS) instruments. Patients (n = 456) at a family medicine clinic completed in-person interviews, REALM and NVS tests which were translated into the Turkish language by translation-back translation process. Additional questions regarding demographic characteristics were also collected. The mean scores (mean +/- standard error) for REALM and NVS were 60.2 +/- 90.32 and 2.60 +/- 0.08, respectively. The REALM test scores showed that 2.7% had inadequate (less than or equal to 6th grade), 38.6% marginal (7th to 8th grade) and 58.7% (greater than or equal to 9th grade) adequate health literacy. The NVS test score revealed a proportion of 28.1% had adequate health literacy. Educational attainment was the most important demographic characteristic found to be related to the health literacy. Reading and vocabulary skills were better than numerical capabilities. Female, primary school educated and poor economic condition participants and those who were older had the lowest scores in both the tests.

AB Objective: To compare patient demographics and Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) scores with respect to their ability to predict medication comprehension.
   Methods: A survey was conducted of 100 patients presenting for follow-up at an academic primary care clinic serving a low socio-economic status population. The Medication Knowledge Score (MKS) consisted of knowledge of drug name, dose, indication, and a potential side effect for each of their medications and then averaged. The REALM (Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine) was administered and socio-demographic characteristics were recorded. The association of REALM score and patient characteristics with MKS was evaluated by univariate and multivariable regression analysis.
   Results: The subjects' mean age was 62 with an average of 9.8 years of schooling and 5.9 prescription medications. Participants identified a correct indication for 78.8% of their medications and correct dosage for 93.4%. However, they could provide the name for only 55.8% of medications and a known side effect for only 11.7%. On multivariate analysis without including REALM score, younger age (p = .01), highest grade completed (p = .001), and female sex (p = .004) remained positively associated with MKS. When the model included REALM, REALM (p < .0001), age (p = .001), and sex (p = .04) remained independently associated with MKS.
   Conclusion: REALM score predicts medication knowledge as assessed by the MKS. However, age, last grade completed, and sex were also independently associated with mean MKS with a similar strength of association to that of REALM. This suggests that simpler cues to screen for medication knowledge deficits may also be useful. Since the MKS incorporates knowledge of medication indications and side effects, it may also be useful for quality and safety purposes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective This study examined factors underlying racial differences in pain and function among patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis (OA)
   Methods Participants were n = 491 African Americans and Caucasians enrolled in a clinical trial of telephone-based OA self-management Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales-2 (AIMS2) pain and function subscales were obtained at baseline Potential explanatory variables included arthritis self-efficacy, AIMS2 affect subscale, problem- and emotion-focused pain coping, demographic characteristics, body mass index, self-reported health, joint(s) with OA, symptom duration, pain medication use, current exercise, and AIMS2 pain subscale (in models of function) Variables associated with both race and pain or function, and which reduced the association of race with pain or function by >= 10%, were included in final multivariable models.
   Results In simple linear regression models, African Americans had worse scores than Caucasians on AIMS2 pain (B = 0 65, P = 0 001) and function (B = 0.59, P < 0.001) subscales In multivariable models race was no longer associated with pain (B = 0 03, P = 0 874) or function (B = 0 07, P = 0 509), indicating these associations were accounted for by other covanates Variables associated with worse AIMS2 pain and function were worse AIMS2 affect scores, greater emotion-focused coping, lower arthritis self-efficacy, and fair or poor self-reported health AIMS2 pain scores were also significantly associated with AIMS2 function
   Conclusion Factors explaining racial differences in pain and function were largely psychological, including arthritis self-efficacy, affect, and use of emotion-focused coping Self-management and psychological interventions can influence these factors, and greater dissemination among African Americans may be a key step toward reducing racial disparities in pain and function Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Osteoarthritis Research Society International

AB The present study examined lay recognition of psychopathy and beliefs about the behavioural manifestations, aetiology, and treatments of psychopathy. A community sample of 232 participants completed a questionnaire consisting of a vignette-identification task, a ratings task of 45 attitudinal items about psychopathy, and demographics. Analysis of the vignette-identification data showed that participants were significantly less likely to correctly identify a case of psychopathy than they were of either depression or schizophrenia. Factors derived from principal components analysis of the attitudinal items revealed that participants generally believed psychopaths to be intelligent and to have criminal tendencies, and that psychopathy was likely caused by early trauma and stress. Overall, participants may have had monological beliefs about the manifestations, aetiology, and treatments of psychopathy. These results suggest that educational programmes are required to improve mental health literacy in relation to psychopathy among the general public.

AB Aim. - To investigate the level of diabetes knowledge in a population with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and a high prevalence of illiteracy, to identify the main gaps in the knowledge and to study the determinants of the knowledge score.
   Methods. - This cross-sectional survey involved 24 diabetes clinics and Kuwaiti adults with T2D (it = 5114), and used the Michigan Diabetes Knowledge Test.
   Results. - The participants' mean age (+/-S.D.) was 55.6 +/- 10.4 years; 68.2% were women, 45.0% were illiterate, 52.2% reported a family income equivalent to 1200 to 2400 euros per month and only 28.6% performed glucose monitoring. Mean +/- S.D. HbA(1c) was 8.76 +/- 2.3%. Their mean score for the total knowledge test was 58.9%. Knowledge deficits were apparent in the questions related to diet and self-care. Participants who were older, and with lower educational levels, limited family income, negative family history of diabetes or were smokers had significantly lower knowledge scores. The scores were also lower in those who had shorter disease duration and fewer complications, were taking insulin, had less frequent insulin injections, performed less glucose monitoring and had lower HbA(1c) levels. Education, family income, glucose monitoring and presence of complications were independent determinants of the knowledge score.
   Conclusion. - Knowledge of diabetes in a T2D population with a high prevalence of illiteracy was poor. Limited family income and lack of self-care are other predictors of knowledge deficits. Efforts need to be focused on educational programmes with strategies to assist T2D patients of limited education and income to manage their disease more effectively. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Limited health literacy has been associated with a range of adverse health outcomes including decreased use of preventive health services, poorer disease-specific outcomes for certain chronic conditions and increased risk of hospitalisation and mortality. Although the majority of research has been conducted in the adult population, there is a small and growing body of research on this subject in the paediatric literature. In this article, we will review the research on health literacy, consider the range of other communication skills associated with limited health literacy and explore strategies to improve patient provider communication for clinicians who care for families with limited health-literacy skills.

AB Objective.-Caregivers of young children frequently measure doses of liquid medications incorrectly. Use of nonstandardized dosing instruments and lack of knowledge that dosing is weight-based contribute to dosing errors. We sought to assess whether low caregiver health literacy was associated with these outcomes.
   Methods.-This was a cross-sectional analysis of caregivers presenting to an urban pediatric emergency room. Dependent variables were caregiver reported use of nonstandardized dosing tools and knowledge of weight-based dosing. The independent variable was caregiver health literacy (Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults [TOFHLAI).
   Results.-Two hundred ninety-two caregivers were assessed: 23.3% reported use of nonstandardized liquid dosing instruments, and 67.8% were unaware of weight-based dosing. Caregivers who were unaware of weight-based dosing were more likely to use nonstandardized dosing tools (28.3% vs 12.8%; P = .003). In unadjusted analyses, overall health literacy, reading comprehension, and numeracy were all associated with both dependent variables. In analyses adjusting for child age, health care experiences, and caregiver acculturation and education, inadequate/marginal overall health literacy was associated with lack of knowledge of weight-based dosing (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.3; P = .03), whereas lower reading comprehension was associated with both lack of knowledge (AOR 2.0; P = .03) and reported use of nonstandardized instrument (AOR 2.4; P = .007).
   Conclusions.-Low health literacy, in particular reading comprehension, was associated with reported use of nonstandardized dosing instruments and lack of knowledge regarding weight-based dosing. Both caregiver health literacy and sociodemographic factors should be considered in the design of interventions to prevent medication administration errors.

AB Background : Medication adherence is a complex phenomenon, influenced by a variety of factors. Most adherence research focuses on one medicine and does not represent the realities of clinical family medicine. This analysis examined factors associated with medication knowledge and adherence in family medicine patients with chronic conditions. Methods: The Residency Research Network of South Texas (RRNeST) enrolled 150 patients with chronic disease who "sometimes have trouble taking medicines." Seventy-five percent were Latinos. This cross-sectional analysis used baseline survey data from an intervention study. Investigators correlated medication knowledge and adherence with known predictors-patient, health, medication, economic, and physician factors. New variables related to patients' motivation to change treatment behaviors ("importance" and "confidence") were also included Results: Linear regression analysis demonstrated that patient satisfaction, education level, and confidence were associated with better medication knowledge. Higher confidence, Spanish language, better functional and health status, and more prescription medicines were correlated with medication adherence. Conclusions: We recommend that family physicians enhance medication adherence by providing good information about treatment and counseling strategies to build patients' confidence. Our findings suggest that poor health status can be a barrier to, rather than a motivator for, treatment adherence.

AB The objective of this study was to analyze the psychometric properties of the English and Spanish S-TOFHLA for three patient populations of interest. Despite being widely used, little is written about psychometric properties of the S-TOFHLA, particularly the Spanish version. Participants were Medicaid and Medicare patients: 936 non-Hispanic and 368 Hispanic patients completed the English S-TOFHLA; 1066 Hispanics completed the Spanish S-TOFHLA. Validity of both versions of the S-TOFHLA was supported by strong positive relationships with education and inverse relationships with age. Significant differences between scores for men and women remained after adjusting for level of education. Score differences occurred across numerous items. More research is needed on the S-TOFHLA and other health literacy instruments to determine why women score differently than men. Variability in literacy skills within subgroups of patients highlights the importance of healthcare providers being sensitive to patients' literacy levels in both spoken and written communications.

AB Objective-We investigated the association between functional health literacy and markers of pregnancy preparedness in women with pregestational diabetes.
   Research Design and Methods-English- and Spanish-speaking pregnant women with pregestational diabetes were recruited. Women completed the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA) short form and a questionnaire. A TOFHLA score of less than or equal to30 was defined as low functional health literacy.
   Results-Of 74 women participating in the study, 16 (22%) were classified as having low functional health literacy. Compared with women with adequate health literacy, those with low health literacy were significantly more likely to have an unplanned pregnancy (P=0.02) and significantly less likely to have either discussed pregnancy ahead of time with an endocrinologist or obstetrician (P=0.01) or taken folic acid (P=0.001).
   Conclusions-The results of this study suggest that low functional health literacy among women with pregestational diabetes is associated with several factors that may adversely impact birth outcomes.

AB This article aims to examine the socio-demographic characteristics associated with access and use of Internet for health-related purposes and its relationship with health literacy. Data were drawn from a health literacy survey (N = 1046) and analysed using logistic regression. Results show a strong association between health literacy, internet access and use. Socio-demographic characteristics particularly age, education, income, perceived health and social isolation also predict internet access. Thus, in addition to widening access, the movement towards digitisation of health information and services should also consider digital skills development to enable people to utilise digital technology more effectively, especially among traditionally hard-to-reach communities.

AB Being aware of controversies and lack of evidence in peritoneal dialysis (PD) training, the Nursing Liaison Committee of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) has undertaken a review of PD training programs around the world in order to develop a syllabus for PD training. This syllabus has been developed to help PD nurses train patients and caregivers based on a consensus of training program reviews, utilizing current theories and principles of adult education. It is designed as a 5-day program of about 3 hours per day, but both duration and content may be adjusted based on the learner. After completion of our proposed PD training syllabus, the PD nurse will have provided education to a patient and/or caregiver such that the patient/caregiver has the required knowledge, skills and abilities to perform PD at home safely and effectively. The course may also be modified to move some topics to additional training times in the early weeks after the initial sessions. Extra time may be needed to introduce other concepts, such as the renal diet or healthy lifestyle, or to arrange meetings with other healthcare professionals. The syllabus includes a checklist for PD patient assessment and another for PD training. Further research will be needed to evaluate the effect of training using this syllabus, based on patient and nurse satisfaction as well as on infection rates and longevity of PD as a treatment.

AB Background: Preventing progression from earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to end-stage kidney disease and minimizing the risk for cardiovascular events and other complications is central to the management of CKD. Patients' active participation in their own care is critical, but may be limited by their lack of awareness and understanding of CKD. We aimed to evaluate educational interventions for primary and secondary prevention of CKD.
   Study Design: Systematic review. Electronic databases were searched to December 2015, with study quality assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias tool.
   Setting & Population: People with CKD stages 1 to 5 in community and hospital settings (studies with only patients with CKD stage 5, kidney transplant recipients irrespective of glomerular filtration rate, or patients receiving dialysis were excluded).
   Selection Criteria for Studies: Randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized studies of educational interventions.
   Interventions: Educational strategies in people with CKD.
   Outcomes: Knowledge, self-management, quality-of-life, and clinical end points.
   Results: 26 studies (12 trials, 14 observational studies) involving 5,403 participants were included. Risk of bias was high in most studies. Interventions were multifaceted, including face-to-face teaching (26 studies), written information (20 studies), and telephone follow-up (13 studies). 20 studies involved 1-on-1 patient/ educator interaction and 14 incorporated group sessions. 9 studies showed improved outcomes for quality of life, knowledge, and self-management; 9 had improved clinical end points; and 2 studies showed improvements in both patient-reported and clinical outcomes. Characteristics of effective interventions included teaching sessions that were interactive and workshops/practical skills (13/15 studies); integrated negotiated goal setting (10/13 studies); involved groups of patients (12/14 studies), their families (4/4 studies), and a multidisciplinary team (6/6 studies); and had frequent (weekly [4/5 studies] or monthly [7/7 studies]) participant/educator encounters.
   Limitations: A meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity of the interventions and outcomes measured.
   Conclusions: Well-designed, interactive, frequent, and multifaceted educational interventions that include both individual and group participation may improve knowledge, self-management, and patient outcomes. (C) 2016 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

AB Objective. To assess the inequalities in adherence to breast and cervical cancer screening according to educational level.
   Methods. A systematic review was carried out between 2000 and 2013 by querying an electronic database using specific keywords. Studies published in English reporting an estimation of the association between level of education and adherence to breast and/or cervical cancer screening were included in the study. Two different meta-analyses were carried out for adherence to breast and cervical cancer screening, respectively: women with the highest level of education and women with the lowest level of education were compared. The level of heterogeneity was investigated and subgroup analyses were carried out.
   Results. Of 1231 identified articles, 10 cross-sectional studies were included in the analysis. The meta-analyses showed that women with the highest level of education were more likely to have both screenings with an overall OR=1.61 (95% CI 1.36-1.91; I-2=71%) for mammography and OR=1.96 (95% CI 1.79-2.16;I-2=0%) for Paptest, respectively. Stratified meta-analysis for breast cancer screening included only studies that reported guidelines with target age of population >= 50 years and showed a reduction in the level of heterogeneity and an increase of 36% in the adherence (95% CI 1.19-1.55; I-2=0%).
   Conclusions. This study confirms and reinforces evidence of inequalities in breast and cervical cancer screening adherence according to educational level. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective. To examine the impact of depressive symptoms on asthma outcomes and medication adherence in inner-city elderly patients with asthma. Methods. Cohort study of elderly asthmatics receiving primary care at three clinics in New York City and Chicago from 1 January 2010 to 1 January 2012. Depressive symptoms were ascertained with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Outcomes included asthma control (Asthma Control Questionnaire, ACQ), asthma-related quality of life (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, AQLQ), and acute resource utilization (inpatient and outpatient visits). Asthma medication adherence was evaluated using the Medication Adherence Reporting Scale (MARS). Results. Three hundred and seventeen participants >= 60 years were included in the study (83% women, 30% Hispanic, and 31% Black). In unadjusted analyses, participants with depressive symptoms were more likely to report poor asthma control (p < .001), worse AQLQ scores (p < .001), and higher rates of inpatient asthma-related visits (odds ratio [OR]: 2.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-3.99). Those with depressive symptoms also reported lower medication adherence (OR: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.10-0.54). Similar results were obtained in analyses adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, asthma medication prescription, years with asthma, intubation history, comorbidities, and health literacy. Conclusion. In this cohort of elderly inner-city participants, depressive symptoms were associated with poorer asthma control and quality of life, as well as with lower rates of adherence to controller medications. Future work exploring possible mediators, including adherence, might elucidate the relationship between depression and poorer asthma outcomes in this population.

AB Health literacy refers to one's ability to obtain, process and understand health information and services to enable sound health decision-making. This is an area of increasing importance due to the complexity of the health system, especially in the cancer setting. A certain level of health literacy is required for patients to fully understand health information and services to make sound decisions about their health care, including decisions about screening and treatment. Previous research has suggested that a significant proportion of the population may have limited health literacy. Suboptimal health literacy is an independent risk factor for poor health outcomes, including increased risk of hospitalization. Cancer patients with poor health literacy may have misconceptions about their disease and ineffective communication with their health professionals, leading to unnecessary interventions, under-treatment or poor adherence to their treatment plans. In addition, cancer patients who have a poor understanding of their disease may experience greater anxiety and be more dissatisfied with their care. Various strategies have been suggested to assist cancer patients with low health literacy. However, more work needs to be done to support all cancer patients with varying levels of health literacy, thus enhancing health experiences and health outcomes.

AB Objective: Mental Health First Aid training is a course for the public that teaches how to give initial help to a person developing a mental health problem or in a mental health crisis. The present study evaluated the effects of Mental Health First Aid training delivered by e-learning on knowledge about mental disorders, stigmatizing attitudes and helping behaviour.
   Method: A randomized controlled trial was carried out with 262 members of the Australian public. Participants were randomly assigned to complete an e-learning CD, read a Mental Health First Aid manual or be in a waiting list control group. The effects of the interventions were evaluated using online questionnaires pre- and post-training and at 6-months follow up. The questionnaires covered mental health knowledge, stigmatizing attitudes, confidence in providing help to others, actions taken to implement mental health first aid and participant mental health.
   Results: Both e-learning and the printed manual increased aspects of knowledge, reduced stigma and increased confidence compared to waiting list. E-learning also improved first aid actions taken more than waiting list, and was superior to the printed manual in reducing stigma and disability due to mental ill health.
   Conclusions: Mental Health First Aid information received by either e-learning or printed manual had positive effects, but e-learning was better at reducing stigma.

AB BACKGROUND: Overall, poor physician-patient communication is related to post-discharge adverse events and readmission. We analyzed patients' ratings of the quality of physician-patient communication during hospitalization and how this varies by health literacy.
   METHODS: Medical patients were interviewed during their hospitalization to assess personal characteristics and health literacy After discharge, patients completed by telephone the 27-item Interpersonal Processes of Care in Diverse Populations Questionnaire (IPC). Using the IPC, patients rated the clarity and quality of physicians' communication during the hospitalization along the following 8 domains: General clarity, Responsiveness to patient concerns, Explanation of patients' problems, Explanation of processes of care, Explanation of self-care after discharge, Empowerment, Decision making, and Consideration of patients' desire and ability to comply with recommendations.
   RESULTS: A total of 84 patients completed both the in-hospital and telephone interviews. Subjects had a mean age of 55, and 44% had inadequate health literacy. Overall, patients gave the poorest ratings to communication that related to Consideration of patients' desire and ability to comply with recommendations. Patients with inadequate health literacy gave significantly worse ratings on the domains of General clarity, Responsiveness to patient concerns, and Explanation of processes of care (P < 0.05 for each). In multivariable analyses, the relationship with General clarity did not persist.
   CONCLUSIONS: Physicians received relatively poor ratings on their Consideration of patients' desire and ability to comply with recommendations. Patients with inadequate health literacy experienced lower quality and clarity of hospital communication along multiple domains. More attention to effective health communication is warranted in the hospital setting. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2010;5:269-275. (C) 2010 Society of Hospital Medicine.

AB Objective: This Study aimed to characterize seniors' belief's about generic drugs, and examine potential correlates of these beliefs, including socioeconomic and health Status variables, health literacy, and physician communication skills.
   Methods: Older adults (>= 65 years) were interviewed in two primary care practices of an inner-city, tertiary care hospital (n = 311). Beliefs about generics were measured using a scale that compared generic and brand name drugs across four domains. Beliefs were modeled with multivariable linear regression.
   Results: Negative beliefs about generics were associated with non-white race (p < 0.0001), lower education (p = 0.008) and income (p = 0.001), and having Medicaid coverage (p = 0.001). Individuals with low health literacy and who reported that their physicians had poor communication skills were more likely to hold negative views (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.003, respectively). In multivariable analysis, black race (beta = -2.30. p = 0.006) and inadequate health literacy (beta = -2.17, p = 0.0004) remained strongly associated with negative views about generic drugs. Poor physician communication skills also predicted negative beliefs about generics but the association was not significant for all levels of communication skill.
   Conclusion: Many low-income seniors mistrust generic medications, especially African-Americans and seniors with low health literacy. Practice implications: Educational efforts to promote generic medications should account for patients' health literacy and Cultural backgrounds. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Impact of health literacy on health outcomes in ambulatory care
   patients: A systematic review
SO ANNALS OF PHARMACOTHERAPY
LA English
DT Article
DE disease outcomes; health literacy; medication adherence
ID HOSPITAL ADMISSION; ADHERENCE; MEDICATION; KNOWLEDGE; SKILLS; RISK
AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between low health literacy and disease state control and between low health literacy medication adherence in the primary care setting.
   DATA SOURCES: The following databases were searched for relevant articles from date of inception to April 2008: The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, Education Resources Information Center, PsycINFO, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and Iowa Drug Information Service. MEDLINE was searched from 1966 to April 2008. Key words included literacy, health literacy, health education, educational status, disease outcomes, health outcomes, adherence, medication adherence, and patient compliance. Additional articles were identified by reviewing reference sections of retrieved articles.
   STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies using a validated measure of health literacy and performing statistical analysis to evaluate the relationship between health literacy and disease state control or medication adherence were evaluated.
   DATA SYNTHESIS: Eleven evaluations, including 10 discrete studies, met eligibility criteria. Six studies evaluated the relationship between health literacy and disease state control, 3 evaluated health literacy and medication adherence, and 1 study evaluated health literacy and both outcomes. A quality rating of poor, fair, or good was assigned to each study based on the study question, population, outcome measures, statistical analysis, and results. Eight studies had good quality, 1 was fair, and 2 were poor. Two high-quality studies demonstrated statistically significant relationships with health literacy, 1 with disease state control and 1 with medication adherence. Limitations of the other studies included inadequate sample size, underrepresentation of patients with low health literacy, use of less objective outcome measures, and insufficient statistical analysis.
   CONCLUSIONS: There may be a relationship between health literacy and disease state control and health literacy and medication adherence. Future research, with adequate representation of patients with low health literacy, is needed to further define this relationship and explore interventions to overcome the impact that low health literacy may have on patient outcomes.

AB Although food allergy can have serious health consequences, little is currently known about people's perceptions of food allergy. The present study examined the differences in awareness and perceptions of food allergy and anxiety between young people with and without a food allergy. Participants completed a questionnaire which asked about their perceptions and knowledge of allergies. perceived health competence and anxiety. Of the 162 participants 24 reported they were allergic to at least one food; these people perceived that their allergy had significantly less of an impact on their lives than others believed it would. Allergy status interacted with perceived health competence to affect anxiety. People with an allergy and with high health competence reported the greatest anxiety levels. Very few of the sample knew the meaning of the term 'anaphylaxis'. Findings are discussed in terms of health education implications and possibilities.

DT Article

AB Background. The comprehension of written health care information, e.g. prescription bottle labels or an informed consent form, impacts on communication with patients and their ability to understand medical procedures, as well as goals of therapy. Objective: To determine if the problem of literacy was present in a population of affluent Albuquerque retirement community dwellers. Methods: We administered the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHL) to 93 residents (71 women and 22 men), using a one-on-one directed examination conducted by one of the authors (J.G.B.). Results:The group studied had a mean age of >70 years, were not acutely ill, had no known loss of mental function, were better educated and had a high standard of living compared to national standards. However, 30% (95% confidence level) of our group were unable to adequately comprehend written information as measured by the TOFHL. The subgroup with poor comprehension (21 women and 7 men) had a mean age of 85 years (versus 82 years in the group with good comprehension) and a mean of 13 years (versus 15 years in the group with good comprehension) of formal education. Multivariate analysis was consistent with a negative effect of age (p = 0.04), a positive effect of years of formal education (p = 0.0005) and no effect of gender on the TOFHL score. Conclusion: Two recent studies, one in an emergency room setting and the other among Medicare enrollees, demonstrated similar results to ours. The high prevalence of poor comprehension in these groups should alert providers to the need to develop additional or different communication skills that can address the problem of poor reading comprehension across at least three diverse groups of people, with particular attention to those over the age of 65.

AB Objective. To ascertain the impact of literacy level on parents' understanding of medical information and ability to follow therapy prescribed for their children.
   Design/Methods. A prospective cohort of parents accompanying their children for acute care. Parents were interviewed about demographic status, their child's health, and use of pediatric preventive services. The Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) test was used to assess parental literacy. The same parent was interviewed 48 to 96 hours later and asked to recall the child's diagnosis, any medication prescribed, and instructions.
   Results. A total of 633 patients were enrolled. Follow-up was obtained in 543 patients (85.8%). Mean parental age was 32.43 years (Sr = 9.07). Mean REALM score was 57.6 (SD = 10.9), corresponding to a 7th- to 8th-grade reading level, with a mean parental educational level of 13.43 years (SD = 2.09). Low REALM score was significantly correlated with young parental age and parental education. African-American race was associated with lower REALM scores. After controlling for these variables, REALM score significantly correlated with parental perception of how sick the child was, but not with use of preventive services, comprehension of diagnosis, medication name and instructions, or ability to obtain and administer prescribed medications.
   Conclusions. Parental literacy level did not correlate with use of preventive services or parental understanding of or ability to follow medical instructions for their children.

AB This study hypothesized that national population health literacy might reflect on their keywords searching. We applied Google searches for "wash hands" and "face mask" during January 19 to February 18 as a surrogate of national population health literacy among 21 countries, and examine whether google searches for "wash hands" and "face masks" would protect from increased numbers of confirmed cases of among 21 countries We found the increased google searches for "wash hands" from January 19 to February 18, 2020, correlated with a lower spreading speed of COVID-19 from February 19 to March 10, 2020 among 21 countries (Pearson's correlation coefficient of -0.70, P < 0.001). The result highlights the importance of public awareness of hand washing in preventing COVID-19 disease spreading.

AB Information seeking is an important behavior for cancer prevention and control, but inequalities in the communication of information about the disease persist. Conceptual models have suggested that low health literacy is a barrier to information seeking, and that fatalistic beliefs about cancer may be a mediator of this relationship. Cancer fatalism can be described as deterministic thoughts about the external causes of the disease, the inability to prevent it, and the inevitability of death at diagnosis. This study aimed to examine the associations between these constructs and sociodemographic factors, and test a mediation model using the American population-representative Health Information and National Trends Survey (HINTS 4), Cycle 3 (n = 2,657). Approximately one third (34%) of the population failed to answer 2/4 health literacy items correctly (limited health literacy). Many participants agreed with the fatalistic beliefs that it seems like everything causes cancer (66%), that one cannot do much to lower his or her chances of getting cancer (29%), and that thinking about cancer makes one automatically think about death (58%). More than half of the population had ever sought information about cancer (53%). In analyses adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and family cancer history, people with limited health literacy were less likely to have ever sought cancer information (odds ratio [OR] = 0.63; 0.42-0.95) and more frequently endorsed the belief that there's not much you can do . . . (OR = 1.61; 1.05-2.47). This fatalistic belief partially explained the relationship between health literacy and information seeking in the mediation model (14% mediation). Interventions are needed to address low health literacy and cancer fatalism to increase public interest in cancer-related information.

AB Purpose: Health literacy is important for health outcomes in adults. However, little is known about the health literacy of adolescents and young adults (AYAs). The purpose of this study was to provide an updated systematic review examining health literacy among AYAs with and without chronic illness. Specifically, the review considered (1) what sources of health information AYAs use; (2) how well AYAs are able to understand, communicate, and critically evaluate health-related information; and (3) whether health literacy is associated with health behaviors and outcomes. Methods: A systematic search was conducted for literature published in peer-reviewed journals using Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO databases. Results: Of 603 articles reviewed, 14 studies met the inclusion criteria, six of which examined health literacy in a chronic illness population. Studies reported high usage for information sources, though no clear links between source type and health literacy emerged. Adequate health literacy was reported in at least 60% of participants, though poor functional literacy was reported. Few studies explored communicative or critical health literacy; those that did indicated that AYAs experience challenges in these domains. Poorer health literacy was associated with some adverse health outcomes, such as obesity and smoking. For AYAs with a chronic illness, there were mixed findings between health literacy and medication adherence. Conclusion: Understanding the challenges AYAs face with regards to complex developing communicative and critical health literacy skills is crucial. Due to the paucity of research in this field, addressing health literacy across all AYAs will provide a valuable step in guiding research in AYAs with cancer.

AB Background: This study provides the first comprehensive empirical evidence of developmental changes in the social influences on seeking mental health care, both in-person and online, during the critical lifestages for mental health of adolescence and young adulthood.
   Methods: Main source of help-seeking influence was determined via self-report for all young people accessing youth-targeted mental health services in Australia for a first episode of care over a 12 month period during 2013. This comprised 30,839 young people who accessed in-person services and 7,155 clients of the online service.
   Results: Results show a major developmental shift in help-seeking influence across the age range, which varied for males and females, and a striking difference between the online and in-person service modalities. The dominant influence online, regardless of age, was the young person themself. In contrast, for in-person services, the dominant influence during adolescence was family, but this changed markedly in late adolescence to favour self-influence, with a lessor, but still substantial effect of family. The influence of friends was surprisingly low.
   Conclusions: To support young people with mental health problems to access mental health care, the personal connection of parents and family needs to be engaged to encourage in-person service use through better mental health literacy, particularly for adolescents. In the online environment, ways to ensure that young people themselves are guided to appropriate services are required.

AB Objective: In 2012, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services implemented a policy that penalizes hospitals for "excessive" all-cause hospital readmissions within 30 days after discharge from an index hospitalization for heart failure (HF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and pneumonia. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of psychiatric comorbidities on 30-day all-cause readmissions following hospitalizations for HF, AMI, and pneumonia.
   Methods: Data from 2009-2011 were derived from the HMO Research Network Virtual Data Warehouse of 11 health systems affiliated with the Mental Health Research Network. All index inpatient hospitalizations for HF, AMI, and pneumonia were captured (N=160,169). Psychiatric diagnoses for the year prior to admission were measured. All-cause readmissions within 30 days of discharge were the outcome variable.
   Results: Approximately 18% of all individuals with index inpatient hospitalizations for HF, AMI, and pneumonia were readmitted within 30 days. The rate of readmission was 5% greater for individuals with a psychiatric comorbidity compared with those without a psychiatric comorbidity (21.7% and 16.5%, respectively, p<.001). Depression, anxiety, and dementia were associated with more readmissions of persons with index hospitalizations for each general medical condition and for all the conditions combined (p<.05). Substance use and bipolar disorders were linked with higher readmissions for those with initial hospitalizations for HF and pneumonia (p<.05). Readmission rates declined overall from 2009 to 2011.
   Conclusions: Individuals with HF, AMI, and pneumonia experience high rates of readmission, but psychiatric comorbidities appear to increase that risk. Future interventions to reduce readmission should consider adding mental health components.

AB Objective: Low health literacy predicts poor health, but the underpinnings of the associations are yet to be understood. This study tested the associations between health literacy and three objective health outcomes in older people and investigated the extent to which general (not health-related) cognition and earlier life-course factors such as childhood cognitive ability, educational level and occupational class accounted for these associations. Method: Participants were 730 community-dwelling older people (350 women; mean age 72.50 years, SD = 0.71). Physical fitness (defined by walk time, lung function, and grip strength), body mass index, and count of natural teeth were used as health outcomes. Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM), Shortened Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA), and Newest Vital Sign (NVS) were used to measure health literacy. Age 11 and concurrent general cognitive ability, educational level, and occupational social class were used as covariates. Results: Lower REALM, S-TOFHLA and NVS scores were associated with worse scores on all health outcomes (beta = .09 to .17). However, cognitive ability in old age and childhood and educational and occupational levels accounted for the majority of these associations: After adjusting for these covariates, only physical fitness was significantly associated with REALM and S-TOFHLA (beta = .06 and .11). Conclusions: Low health literacy was associated with poorer health largely because it reflected general cognitive ability, educational and/or occupational levels. These variables plays some role in health beyond their association with the reading and numeracy skills captured by common health literacy measures.

AB Previous studies have reported that health literacy limitations are associated with poorer disease control for chronic conditions, but have not evaluated potential associations with medication adherence.
   To determine whether health literacy limitations are associated with poorer antidepressant medication adherence.
   Observational new prescription cohort follow-up study.
   Adults with type 2 diabetes who completed a survey in 2006 and received a new antidepressant prescription during 2006-2010 (N = 1,366) at Kaiser Permanente Northern California.
   Validated three-item self-report scale measured health literacy. Discrete indices of adherence based on pharmacy dispensing data according to validated methods: primary non-adherence (medication never dispensed); early non-persistence (dispensed once, never refilled); non-persistence at 180 and 365 days; and new prescription medication gap (NPMG; proportion of time that the person is without medication during 12 months after the prescription date).
   Seventy-two percent of patients were classified as having health literacy limitations. After adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical covariates, patients with health literacy limitations had significantly poorer adherence compared to patients with no limitations, whether measured as early non-persistence (46 % versus 38 %, p < 0.05), non-persistence at 180 days (55 % versus 46 %, p < 0.05), or NPMG (41 % versus 36%, p < 0.01). There were no significant associations with primary adherence or non-persistence at 365 days.
   Poorer antidepressant adherence among adults with diabetes and health literacy limitations may jeopardize the continuation and maintenance phases of depression pharmacotherapy. Findings underscore the importance of national efforts to address health literacy, simplify health communications regarding treatment options, improve public understanding of depression treatment, and monitor antidepressant adherence.

AB Purpose: Low health literacy has been associated with poor health-related outcomes. The purposes are to report the development of a website for low-literate parents in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), and the findings of heuristic evaluation and a usability testing of this website.
   Methods: To address low literacy of NICU parents, multimedia educational Website using visual aids (e.g., pictographs, photographs), voice-recorded text message in addition to a simplified text was developed. The text was created at the 5th grade readability level. The heuristic evaluation was conducted by three usability experts using 10 heuristics. End-users' performance was measured by counting the time spent completing tasks and number of errors, as well as recording users' perception of ease of use and usefulness (PEUU) in a sample of 10 NICU parents.
   Results: Three evaluators identified 82 violations across the 10 heuristics. All violations, however, received scores <2, indicating minor usability problems. Participants' time to complete task varies from 81.2 s (SD = 30.9) to 2.2 s (SD = 1.3). Participants rated the Website as easy to use and useful (PEUU mean = 4.52, SD = 0.53). Based on the participants' comments, appropriate modifications were made.
   Discussion and conclusions: Different types of visuals on the Website were well accepted by low-literate users and agreement of visuals with text improved understanding of the educational materials over that with text alone. The findings suggest that using concrete and realistic pictures and pictographs with clear captions would maximize the benefit of visuals. One emerging theme was "simplicity" in design (e.g., limited use of colors, one font type and size), content (e.g., avoid lengthy text), and technical features (e.g., limited use of pop-ups). The heuristic evaluation by usability experts and the usability test with actual users provided complementary expertise, which can give a richer assessment of a design for low literacy Website. These results facilitated design modification and implementation of solutions by categorizing and prioritizing the usability problems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background. As new genomic technology expands the number of medical tests available to physicians and patients, identifying gaps in our understanding of how best to communicate risk is increasingly important. We examined how health literacy informs breast cancer survivors' understanding of and meaning assigned to recurrence risks yielded by genomic tests. Methods. Study participants were posttreatment female breast cancer survivors (N = 163) recruited at a university breast cancer clinic. We assessed their health literacy (using REALM) and their interpretation of hypothetical recurrence risk results from a genomic test, presented in several verbal and numerical formats. Analyses controlled for women's objective recurrence risk, age, income, and race. Results. Women with lower health literacy gave higher mean estimates of recurrence risk for a hypothetical group of women with early-stage breast cancer than did women with higher health literacy (52% v. 30%, P < 0.001). Women with lower health literacy also gave more variable estimates in this and several other tasks. When making chemotherapy decisions using risks presented in verbal formats, decisions by women with lower health literacy were less sensitive to the difference between low and high recurrence risk. Ease of understanding of risk formats differed by health literacy. Conclusions. Health literacy affected the meanings women assigned to recurrence risk when presented in certain formats. The greater variability in responding by women with lower health literacy supports the hypothesis that they have less precise mental representations of risk, but more research is needed to rule out other possible explanations.

AB BACKGROUND: Prior studies have linked limited literacy to poorer HIV medication adherence, although the precise causal pathways of this relationship have only been initially investigated.
   OBJECTIVE: To examine whether social stigma is a possible mediator to the relationship between literacy and self-reported HIV medication adherence.
   DESIGN: Structured patient interviews with a literacy assessment, supplemented by medical chart review, were conducted among patients receiving care at infectious disease clinics in Shreveport, Louisiana and Chicago, Illinois. Literacy was measured using the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM), while stigma was measured using items taken from the Patient Medication Adherence Questionnaire (PMAQ).
   PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and four consecutive patients participated.
   RESULTS: Approximately one-third of the patients (30.4%) were less than 100% adherent to their regimen, and 31.4% had marginal (7th-8th grade) or low (<= 6th grade) literacy. In multivariate analyses, patients with low literacy were 3.3 times more likely to be non-adherent to antiretroviral regimens (95% CI 1.3-8.7; p < 0.001). Perceived social stigma was found to mediate the relationship between literacy and medication adherence (AOR 3.1, 95% CI 1.3-7.7).
   CONCLUSIONS: While low literacy was a significant risk factor for improper adherence to HIV medication regimens in our study, perceived social stigma mediated this relationship. Low literacy HIV intervention strategies may also need to incorporate more comprehensive psychosocial approaches to overcome stigma barriers.

AB Background: Mental ill health is a common condition in the general population, yet only about half of those with a mental disorder have treatment contact. Personal experience may affect attitudes, which in turn influence the help-seeking process. This study investigated differences in mental health literacy and attitudes among mentally healthy persons and in persons with symptoms of mental illness with and without treatment contact.
   Method: A postal screening questionnaire was sent to a random sample of the general population aged 20-64 in the county of Skaraborg, Sweden in order to ascertain mental health status and history of treatment contact; 3538 responded (49%). Face-to-face interviews were carried out in random sub samples of mentally healthy persons (n = 128) and in mentally ill persons with (n = 125) and without (n = 105) mental health care contact. Mental health literacy and attitudes to treatment were assessed using questions based on a vignette depicting a person with depression. Past month mental disorder was diagnosed according to the Schedule for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN).
   Results: Two thirds failed to recognize depression in a vignette; recognition was equally poor in mentally healthy persons and in persons with symptoms of mental illness with and without treatment contact. In response to an open-ended question concerning appropriate interventions, one third suggested counselling and only one percent proposed antidepressant treatment. Again, proportions were similar in all groups. Persons with a history of mental health contact more often suggested that a GP would provide the best form of help. When presented with a list of possible interventions, those with a history of mental health contact were more positive to medical interventions such as antidepressants, hypnotics, and inpatient psychiatric treatment. When asked about the prognosis for the condition described in the vignette, persons with treatment contact were less likely to believe in full recovery without intervention; mentally ill without treatment contact were more optimistic.
   Conclusion: Mental health literacy, specially concerning attitudes towards interventions is associated with personal history of mental health care.

DE decision making; health literacy; information needs; mothers; nursing
AB Aim and objectives. This paper aims to highlight the information-based dilemmas of a particular group of healthcare patients, first-time mothers over 35 years.
   Background. In recent years, there has been a proliferation of health-related information and a move towards greater public access to health information as an important step towards patient education and empowerment. Information technologies, such as the Internet, have added considerable momentum to this trend. Many health professionals now consider the provision of detailed health information to patients as requisite for informed decision making. Within the literature there is some emphasis on the importance of patient understanding of information received; however, to date, few studies have considered information over-consumption as problematic. Methods. Using in-depth interviews, a sample of 22 first-time mothers over 35 years was interviewed over three junctures: 35 weeks gestation, 10-14 days postpartum and six to eight months postpartum. Three focus group interviews of midwives and maternal and child health nurses were also conducted. This paper was undertaken as part of a larger project to evaluate the experience of first mothering over 35 years.
   Results. Mothers in this study were found to have access to large volumes of health information. This tendency was driven by both the women and the health professionals who cared for them. Midwives and maternal and child health nurses revealed a tendency to provide older first-time mothers with considerable health information of a medical orientation, understanding that this is what the women required. However, despite common perceptions of empowerment, the consumption of medical-type information proved frightening and many mothers described feeling overwhelmed by 'knowing too much'.
   Conclusion. This study contributes to the limited understanding of the information needs of a growing group of childbearing women, first-time mothers over 35 years. By providing an insight into the 'downside' of extensive health information, nursing staff, in particular, may consider the amount and type of information they distribute. Some suggestions are offered to health professionals to ameliorate the information-based dilemmas of these women.
   Relevance to clinical practice. As the number of childbearing women over 35 years continues to grow, it is important for health professionals to understand the particular needs of this group. In doing so, doctors, midwives and maternal and child health nurses may be in a position to provide more meaningful maternal support.

AB Background Surveys of the public in several countries have found a predominant belief in social environmental causes of mental disorders. The present study was conducted to determine whether this has changed over time in Australia. Method Beliefs about causes and risk factors were assessed using questions based around case vignettes of a person with depression or schizophrenia. These questions were asked in a national survey of 2,031 Australians aged 18-74 carried out in 1995, and a second survey of 1,823 persons carried out in 2003-2004. Results The major changes were an increase in belief in genetic causes of both depression and schizophrenia, increases in beliefs about problems from childhood and the death of someone close as causes of depression, and a decrease in the belief that "weakness of character" is a cause of schizophrenia. Conclusion There has been an increase in belief about genetic causes, which may be due to publicity about the human genome project and related scientific advances. This change has not been at the expense of belief in social causes, and it has been accompanied by a decrease in the belief that personal weakness is a cause.

AB The authors tested whether self-efficacy for orthopedic rehabilitation tasks accounted for significant variance in rehabilitation outcome, over the variance accounted for by dispositional optimism, health competence, and health value. Whether health value moderated expectancy-outcome relationships also was examined. One hundred five older clients at 2 orthopedic rehabilitation facilities completed a battery of instruments; physical functioning also was assessed. After controlling for physical functioning at admission and for other variables, self-efficacy predicted significant variance in rehabilitation outcome. Health value did not moderate expectancy-outcome relationships. Results suggest that psychologists can improve patients' recovery from serious orthopedic problems by augmenting their self-efficacy beliefs.

AB Nutrition literacy and food literacy have become increasingly important concepts in health promotion. Researchers use one or the other term to describe the competencies needed to maintain a healthy diet. This systematic review examines whether these terms are synonymous or if their meanings are substantially different.
   We searched major bibliographic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect, CINAHL, SocIndex and ERIC) for publications that provided an original definition of nutrition or food literacy. Then we used Nutbeam's tripartite health literacy model as an analytical grid. The definitions we found included specific competencies, which we mapped to the domains of functional, interactive, or critical literacy.
   In the 173 full-text publications we screened, we found six original definitions of nutrition literacy, and 13 original definitions of food literacy. Seven food literacy definitions were integrated into a conceptual framework. Analysing their structure revealed that nutrition literacy and food literacy are seen as specific forms of health literacy, and represent distinct but complementary concepts. Definitions of nutrition literacy mainly described the abilities necessary to obtain and understand nutrition information. Definitions of food literacy incorporated a broader spectrum of theoretical and practical knowledge and skills. To be food literate also means to apply information on food choices and critically reflect on the effect of food choice on personal health and on society. Since food literacy is based on a more comprehensive understanding of health behaviours, it is the more viable term to use in health promotion interventions. For the practical implication, a harmonization of the different definitions is desirable.

AB A long-standing belief is that sign language interferes with spoken language development in deaf children, despite a chronic lack of evidence supporting this belief. This deserves discussion as poor life outcomes continue to be seen in the deaf population. This commentary synthesizes research outcomes with signing and non-signing children and highlights fully accessible language as a protective factor for healthy development. Brain changes associated with language deprivation may be misrepresented as sign language interfering with spoken language outcomes of cochlear implants. This may lead to professionals and organizations advocating for preventing sign language exposure before implantation and spreading misinformation. The existence of one-time-sensitive-language acquisition window means a strong possibility of permanent brain changes when spoken language is not fully accessible to the deaf child and sign language exposure is delayed, as is often standard practice. There is no empirical evidence for the harm of sign language exposure but there is some evidence for its benefits, and there is growing evidence that lack of language access has negative implications. This includes cognitive delays, mental health difficulties, lower quality of life, higher trauma, and limited health literacy. Claims of cochlear implant- and spoken language-only approaches being more effective than sign language-inclusive approaches are not empirically supported. Cochlear implants are an unreliable standalone first-language intervention for deaf children. Priorities of deaf child development should focus on healthy growth of all developmental domains through a fully-accessible first language foundation such as sign language, rather than auditory deprivation and speech skills.

AB Objective: To gain new insights into the relationship between health literacy and evaluation of online health information.
   Methods: Using a mixed-methods approach, forty-four semi-structured interviews were conducted followed by a short questionnaire on health literacy and eHealth literacy. Qualitative and quantitative data were merged to explore differences and similarities among respondents with different health literacy levels.
   Results: Thematic analysis showed that most respondents did not question the quality of online health information and relied on evaluation criteria not recognized by existing web quality guidelines. Individuals with low health literacy, despite presenting higher eHealth literacy scores, appeared to use less established criteria and to rely more heavily on non-established ones compared to those with high health literacy.
   Conclusion: Disparities in evaluation ability among people with different health literacy might be related to differences in awareness of the issue and to the use of different evaluation criteria. Future research should quantitatively investigate the interplay between health literacy, use of established and non-established criteria, and ability to evaluate online health information.
   Practice implications: Communication and patient education efforts should aim to raise awareness on online health information quality and to promote use of established evaluation criteria, especially among low health literate citizens. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Concerns over online health information-seeking behavior point to the potential harm incorrect, incomplete, or biased information may cause. However, systematic reviews of health information have found few examples of documented harm that can be directly attributed to poor quality information found online.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to improve our understanding of the quality and quality characteristics of information found in online discussion forum websites so that their likely value as a peer-to-peer health information-sharing platform could be assessed.
   Methods: A total of 25 health discussion threads were selected across 3 websites (Reddit, Mumsnet, and Patient) covering 3 health conditions (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], diabetes, and chickenpox). Assessors were asked to rate information found in the discussion threads according to 5 criteria: accuracy, completeness, how sensible the replies were, how they thought the questioner would act, and how useful they thought the questioner would find the replies.
   Results: In all, 78 fully completed assessments were returned by 17 individuals (8 were qualified medical doctors, 9 were not). When the ratings awarded in the assessments were analyzed, 25 of the assessments placed the discussion threads in the highest possible score band rating them between 5 and 10 overall, 38 rated them between 11 and 15, 12 rated them between 16 and 20, and 3 placed the discussion thread they assessed in the lowest rating band (21-25). This suggests that health threads on Internet discussion forum websites are more likely than not (by a factor of 4: 1) to contain information of high or reasonably high quality. Extremely poor information is rare; the lowest available assessment rating was awarded only 11 times out of a possible 353, whereas the highest was awarded 54 times. Only 3 of 78 fully completed assessments rated a discussion thread in the lowest possible overall band of 21 to 25, whereas 25 of 78 rated it in the highest of 5 to 10. Quality assessments differed depending on the health condition (chickenpox appeared 17 times in the 20 lowest-rated threads, HIV twice, and diabetes once). Although assessors tended to agree on which discussion threads contained good quality information, what constituted poor quality information appeared to be more subjective.
   Conclusions: Most of the information assessed in this study was considered by qualified medical doctors and nonmedically qualified respondents to be of reasonably good quality. Although a small amount of information was assessed as poor, not all respondents agreed that the original questioner would have been led to act inappropriately based on the information presented. This suggests that discussion forum websites may be a useful platform through which people can ask health-related questions and receive answers of acceptable quality.

AB Objective: Diabetes patients with limited resources often experience suboptimal care. Less is known about the role of effective health communication (HC) in caring for low income diabetes patients.
   Methods: Ten health department clinics in TN participated in a trial evaluating a literacy-sensitive communication intervention. We assessed the quality of baseline HC and measured associations with diabetes outcomes. Assessments included: demographics, measures of HC, health literacy, self-care behaviors, self-efficacy, medication non-adherence, treatment satisfaction, and A1C. Unadjusted and adjusted multivariable regression models were used to test associations.
   Results: Participants (N = 411) were 49.7 +/- 9.5 years, 61% female, uninsured (96%), with A1C 9.6 +/- 2.1. In unadjusted analyses, better communication, was associated with lower medication non-adherence (OR 0.40-0.68, all p < 0.05), higher treatment satisfaction (OR 1.76-1.96, all p < 0.01), portion size reduction (OR 1.43, p < 0.05), diabetes self-efficacy (OR 1.41, p < 0.05), and lower A1C (beta = -0.06, p < 0.01). In adjusted analyses, communication quality remained associated with lower medication non-adherence (AOR 0.39-0.68, all p < 0.05), and higher treatment satisfaction (AOR 1.90-2.21, all p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Better communication between low-income patients and providers was independently associated with lower medication non-adherence and higher treatment satisfaction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: There is increasing concern over the risk of consumer unintentional misuse of non-prescription (a.k.a. 'over-the-counter') medications containing acetaminophen, which could lead to acute liver failure.
   OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of potential misuse and overdose of over-the-counter medications containing acetaminophen, either alone or in combination.
   DESIGN: Cross-sectional, structured interviews with literacy assessment.
   SETTING: One academic and one community-based general internal medicine practice in Chicago, IL, and one academic general internal medicine practice and a public hospital clinic in Atlanta, GA.
   PATIENTS: Five hundred adults seeking primary care, ages 18-80.
   MEASUREMENT: Demonstration of how and when patients would take over-the-counter medications containing acetaminophen, alone or in combination with one another, over a 24-hour period.
   RESULTS: Overall, 23.8 % of participants demonstrated they would overdose on a single over-the-counter acetaminophen product by exceeding a dose of four grams in a 24-hour period; 5.2 % made serious errors by dosing out more than six grams. In addition, 45.6 % of adults demonstrated they would overdose by 'double-dipping' with two acetaminophen-containing products. In multivariable analyses, limited literacy (Relative Risk Ratio (RR) 1.65, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) 1.03-2.66) and heavy acetaminophen use in the past six months (RR 1.70, 95 % CI 1.10-2.64) were independently associated with overdosing over-the-counter products.
   CONCLUSION: Misunderstanding of the active ingredient and proper instructions for over-the-counter medications containing acetaminophen is common. The potential for errors and adverse events associated with unintentional misuse of these products is substantial, particularly among heavy users of acetaminophen and those with limited literacy.

AB BACKGROUND: Health literacy deficits affect half of the US overall patient population, especially the elderly, and are linked to poor health outcomes among noncancer patients. Yet little is known about how health literacy affects cancer populations. The authors examined the relation between health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and health literacy among men with prostate cancer. METHODS: Data analysis included 1581 men with newly diagnosed clinically localized prostate cancer from a population-based study, the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP). Participants completed assessment of health literacy using Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) and HRQOL using the Short Form-12 General Health Survey (SF12). Bivariate and multivariate regression was used to determine the potential association between REALM and HRQOL, while controlling for sociodemographic and illness-related variables. RESULTS: Higher health literacy level was significantly associated with better mental well-being (SF12-Mental Component Summary [MCS]; P < .001) and physical well-being (SF12-Physical Component Summary [PCS]; P < .001) in bivariate analyses. After controlling for sociodemographic (age, marital status, race, income, and education) and illness-related factors (types of cancer treatment, tumor aggressiveness, and comorbidities), health literacy remained significantly associated with SF12-MCS scores (P < .05) but not with SF12-PCS scores. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer, those with low health literacy levels were more vulnerable to mental distress than those with higher health literacy levels, but physical well-being was no different. These findings suggest that health literacy may be important in patients managing prostate cancer and the effects of treatment, and provide the hypothesis that supportive interventions targeting patients with lower health literacy may improve their HRQOL.

AB Access to timely treatment may be one contributing factor to survival differences by race/ethnicity among breast cancer patients. In this study, we examined the relationship between race and treatment delay among breast cancer patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2006 with Stage I-III breast cancer from the National Cancer Database (n=250,007). We evaluated factors associated with receipt of initial treatment more than 30, 60, and 90 days after biopsy using multivariable log binomial models to estimate risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The average time to treatment was 34.30 days (+/- 31.77). Independent of health insurance, stage at diagnosis, and age, Black and Hispanic patients had higher risks of 30, 60, and 90-day treatment delay compared with White patients. Further studies are needed to define the role of structural, health system, physician, clinical and patient factors in treatment delay among Black and Hispanic women and appropriate interventions.

ID CARE; QUESTIONS; IMPACT
AB Low health literacy affects nearly half of the U. S. population. Health care professionals may not recognize low health literacy in their patients nor understand its impact on health outcomes. The purpose of this pilot study was to describe nurses' knowledge and perceptions of low health literacy on patients, their practice, and the health system. This cross-sectional, descriptive study used a web-based survey to assess the knowledge and perceptions of health literacy among nursing professionals. Registered nurses licensed by the State of California were randomly selected and invited to participate in the study. Data analysis included descriptive statistics to describe nursing professionals' general knowledge and perceptions. Qualitative textual analysis was done on participant responses to a survey question that asks participants to define health literacy using their own words. Results of this study revealed that nursing professionals' knowledge of health literacy and their understanding on the role health literacy plays on patient health outcomes is limited. Health literacy was also reported to be a low priority among providers and organizations. Nursing plays an important role in direct patient care and in the delivery of health services. Educating nurses on health literacy and improving patient communication and understanding can improve health outcomes.

AB Background: Professional and patient groups have called for increased participation of patients' informal support networks in chronic disease care, as a means to improve clinical care and self-management. Little is known about the current level of participation of family and friends in the physician visits of adults with chronic illnesses or how that participation affects the experience of patients and physicians.
   Methods: Written survey of 439 functionally independent adults with diabetes or heart failure and 88 of their primary care physicians (PCPs). Patients were ineligible if they had a memory disorder, needed help with activities of daily living, or were undergoing cancer treatment.
   Results: Nonprofessional friends or family ("companions") regularly participated in PCP visits for nearly half (48%) of patients. In multivariable models, patients with low health literacy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] : 2.9, confidence interval [CI] : 1.4-5.7), more depressive symptoms (AOR: 1.3, CI: 1.1-1.6), and 4 or more comorbid illnesses (AOR: 3.7, CI: 1.3-10.5) were more likely to report companion participation. Patients reported that they were more likely to understand PCP advice (77%) and discuss difficult topics with the physician (44%) when companions participated in clinic visits. In multivariable models, companion participation was associated with greater patient satisfaction with their PCP (AOR: 1.7, CI: 1.1-2.7). Most PCPs perceived visit companions positively, however 66% perceived 1 or more barriers to increasing companion participation, including increased physician burden (39%), inadequate physician training (27%), and patient privacy concerns (24%).
   Conclusion: Patients' companions represent an important source of potential support for the clinical care of functionally independent patients with diabetes or heart failure, particularly for patients vulnerable to worse outcomes. Companion participation in care was associated with positive patient and physician experiences. Physician concerns about companion participation are potentially addressable through existing training resources.

AB Background Construction is a hazardous occupation, with Latino (Hispanic) workers at a greater risk for death than other ethnicities/races. Latinos accounted for over half of construction injuries involving days away from work in Nevada in 2006.
   Methods This study recruited 30 Latino construction workers front three Southern Nevada trade unions to participate in four focus groups conducted in Spanish to determine their perceived risks for injury. Audiotapes were transcribed into English transcripts, which were analyzed for themes.
   Results Themes included language/communication difficulties, traditional Latino values. construction trade skill level differences, and health literacy. Participants were unfamiliar with the workers' compensation system.
   Conclusions Small contractors in particular should provide more effective safety training in Spanish and appropriate safety equipment. Unions should offer English language training using simulation and more in,information about workers' compensation rights. Occupational health providers should consider Latino belief's and communication needs when assessing health status or providing care. Am. J. Ind. Med. 53: 179-187, 2010. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Objective: This study examined the influence of primary care physicians' knowledge of and attitudes to eating disorders on their treatment decisions.
   Method: A sample of primary care physicians completed self-report measures on eating disorders and their attitudes towards such patients. They also indicated their diagnosis and treatment decisions in response to case vignettes.
   Results: Physicians had substantial gaps in knowledge of the eating disorders. Attitudes to anorexia nervosa clustered differently to those toward patients with bulimia nervosa. However, for both disorders, the factor that explained the most variance was illness duration and consequences. There was no association of knowledge and attitudes, and these variables did not predicted the likelihood of diagnosing an eating disorder. However, those with higher knowledge scores were more likely to ensure that a follow-up appointment took place, particularly when they held the attitude that people with anorexia nervosa had personal control over their problem.
   Discussion: There is a need for greater education of primary care physicians regarding the diagnosis and treatment of the eating disorders, and for that information to be more readily accessible when it is needed. Their clinical actions need to be guided by more objective sources of information and protocols. (C) 2008 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Physical Activity and Quality of Life in Adult Survivors of
   Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY

   PREVALENCE; CHALLENGES; AVOIDANCE; MODEL
AB Purpose
   To examine the prevalence and correlates of physical activity in adult survivors of aggressive non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) and to explore the association between physical activity level and health-related quality of life (HRQOL).
   Patients and Methods
   Physical activity and HRQOL data from 319 survivors of NHL (mean age, 59.8 years, standard deviation, +/- 14.8) who were diagnosed in Los Angeles County approximately 2 to 5 years before the study was analyzed.
   Results
   One quarter of survivors of NHL met public health guidelines of 150 minutes or more of moderate to vigorous exercise per week. More than half (53%) reported some activity but less than 150 minutes per week, whereas 20% reported no physical activity. Females, those with lower perceived health competence, and individuals with more comorbid limitations were at increased risk for inactivity. Individuals who met public health guidelines reported better HRQOL than those who were sedentary. Interestingly, our findings suggest a significant positive association between HRQOL and those who get at least some exercise.
   Conclusion
   The effort to promote physical activity among cancer survivors, who are at risk for poor quality of life as a result of treatment, is of great importance to the health of this growing population. As NHL, similar to other cancers, becomes a disease that people live with as opposed to one that people die as a result of, oncologists and primary care physicians will be increasingly challenged to provide evidence-based guidance for the long-term management of the patient's health. Consideration should be given to how clinicians frame exercise-promoting messages to cancer survivors, especially to those who are sedentary.

AB Background: Chinese-language speakers comprise the largest non-English speaking population in Australia but they have among the lowest rates of mental health services utilisation.
   Material: A bilingual (Mandarin/English) researcher conducted in-depth interviews with China-born mental health patients and members of the general community, and mental health service providers.
   Discussion: Participants identified several factors that limit access to mental healthcare as well as the quality of care received: mental health literacy, communication difficulties, stigma, confidentiality concerns, service constraints and discrimination. Cross-cultural communication was not just a matter of hearing individual words but also appreciating idioms and cultural and social references.
   Conclusion: Findings have implications for the prevention and treatment of mental disorders among migrants from China, and caution against assuming heterogeneity within ethnic groups. Mental health services must become more culturally competent in their attempts to engage the target group and to deliver both acute and continuing care.

AB Mass media are very influential in shaping discourses about health but few studies have examined the extent to which newspaper coverage of such stories reflect issues embedded in health policy documents. We estimate the relative distribution of health stories using content analysis. Nine meta-topics are used to sort stories across a range of major influences shaping the health status of populations adapted from the document Toward a Healthy Future (Second Report on the Health of Canadians (1999)) (TAHF). A total of 4732 stories were analyzed from 13 Canadian daily newspapers (10 English, 3 French language) using a constructed week per quarter method. Stories were sampled from each chosen newspaper for the years 1993, 1995, 1997 and 2001. 72% (n = 3405) of stories in this analysis were from English-language papers, 28% (n = 1327) were from French-language papers. Topics related to health care (dealing either with issues of service provision and delivery or management and regulation) dominated newspaper stories, accounting for 65% of all stories. Physical environment topics accounted for about 13% of all stories, the socio-economic environment about 6% of stories, personal health practices about 5% of stories, and scientific advances in health research about 4% of stories. Other influences upon health identified in TAHF were rarely mentioned. The overall prominence of topics in newspapers is not consistent with the relative importance assigned to health influences in TAHF. Canadian newspapers rarely report on socio-economic influences frequently cited in the research literature (and reflected in TAHF) as being most influential in shaping population health outcomes.

   OLDER-ADULTS; COMMUNITY; KNOWLEDGE; DISEASE
AB The concept of health literacy is a recent addition to healthcare literature, appearing in the early to mid 1990s. Health literacy refers to individuals' ability to understand their healthcare issues and effectively care for themselves in the healthcare system. Individuals' health literacy abilities vary greatly and can be viewed on a continuum ranging from adequate to marginal to inadequate. Repeated research has demonstrated that older individuals, the geriatric patient population, are at risk of inadequate or marginal health literacy. This risk impacts health outcomes and cost for caring for the older people in our society who are the consumers of a large quantity of healthcare services.
   The demographic data from the research show that multiple factors influence an individual's health literacy. Besides age, individuals with less education, lower income, "blue collar" jobs, and poor health status (mental and physical) can be at risk of marginal or inadequate health literacy. Providing care to low health literacy patients is complicated by commercially prepared healthcare materials and presentations that are often written well above the average national literacy level. Studies in this review examine various approaches to healthcare education and provide viable options for educating those with low health literacy. This review stresses the importance of healthcare professionals identifying older individuals with marginal or inadequate health literacy and being able to provide education in an effective manner to this segment of the population.

AB BACKGROUND: Despite advances in treatment of diabetes, many barriers to good glycemic control remain.
   OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between glycemic control and the driving distance from home to the site of primary care.
   DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of data from the Vermont Diabetes Information System.
   PARTICIPANTS: Nine-hundred and seventy-three adults with diabetes in primary care. The mean age was 64.9 years, 57% were female, and 18.4% used insulin.
   MEASUREMENTS: Hemoglobin A1c, shortest driving distance from a patient's home to the site of primary care calculated by geographic software, self-reported gender, age, education, income, marital status, race, insurance coverage, diabetic complications, and use of insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents.
   RESULTS: Controlling for social, demographic, seasonal, and treatment variables, there was a positive, significant relationship between glycemic control and driving distance (beta = +0.07%/10 km, P < 0.001, 95% confidence interval [CI] = +0.03, +0.11). Driving distance had a stronger association with glycemic control among insulin users (beta = +0.22%/10 km, beta = .016, 95% CI = +0.04, +0.40) than among non-insulin users (beta = +0.06%/ 10 km, P = .006, 95% CI = +0.02, +0.10).
   CONCLUSION: Longer driving distances from home to the site of primary care were associated with poorer glycemic control in this population of older, rural subjects. While the mechanism for this effect is not known, providers should be aware of this potential barrier to good glycemic control.

AB The number of older prisoners is increasing exponentially. For example, the number of geriatric female prisoners in California has increased 350% in the past decade. Despite an increasing population of geriatric female prisoners, the degree of functional impairment in this population is unknown. Therefore, the goals of this study were to describe the prevalence and nature of functional impairment in geriatric female prisoners in California and to identify aspects of the prison environment that may exacerbate functional impairments.
   Questionnaires were analyzed from 120 geriatric women in California state prisons. Functional impairment was defined as impairment in activities of daily living (ADLs) or in prison ADLs (PADLs), including dropping to the floor for alarms, standing for count, getting to meals, hearing orders, and climbing onto the top bunk. The mean age of participants was 62; 16% were dependent in one ADL, and 69% reported one PADL impairment. Increasing severity of functional impairment was associated with worse health status and more adverse prison experiences. For example, fall rates ranged from 33% in women without impairment to 57% with PADL impairment to 63% with ADL dependence (P=.02). Several prison environmental stressors were identified that likely exacerbate functional impairment. For example, 29% of geriatric women were assigned to a top bunk.
   Geriatric female prisoners report high rates of functional impairment. ADL and PADL impairment were associated with worse health status and adverse prison experiences. Therefore, the evaluation of functional impairment in geriatric female prisoners needs to consider the unique demands of the prison environment.

AB In this study, the authors investigated whether self-reported physical functioning of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic systolic heart failure (CHF) was primarily explained by illness-specific differences related to diagnosis or whether more generic factors also contributed to their physical functioning. Consecutive patients with COPD (n = 56; mean age = 67.8, SD = 8.5) and CHF (n = 65; mean age = 60.0, SD = 10.2) from the outpatient clinics of a university hospital and a general hospital completed a self-report questionnaire, including the Rand-36 Health Survey, Cantril's ladder the Mastery scale, the Perceived Health Competence Scale, and the Self-efficacy scale. COPD patients scored significantly worse in self-reported physical and psychological functioning and perceived health competence than did patients with CHE Regression analysis revealed that both the diagnosis and the illness severity contributed to self-reported physical functioning, although self-efficacy explained the main part of physical functioning. Therefore, important aims in the treatment of patients with COPD and CHF should be not only improving physical functioning but also enhancing self-efficacy.

TI Patient portals and health apps: Pitfalls, promises, and what one might
   learn from the other symptoms
SO HEALTHCARE-THE JOURNAL OF DELIVERY SCIENCE AND INNOVATION
LA English
DT Article
ID MOBILE; TECHNOLOGY; ERRORS
AB Widespread use of health information technology (IT) could potentially increase patients' access to their health information and facilitate future goals of advancing patient-centered care. Despite having increased access to their health data, patients do not always understand this information or its implications, and digital health data can be difficult to navigate when displayed in a small-format, complex interface. In this paper, we discuss two forms of patient-facing health IT tools-patient portals and applications (apps)-and highlight how, despite several limitations of each, combining high-yield features of mobile health (mHealth) apps with portals could increase patient engagement and self-management and be more effective than either of them alone. Patient portal adoption is variable, and due to design and interface limitations and health literacy issues, many people find the portal difficult to use. Conversely, apps have experienced rapid adoption and traditionally have more consumer-friendly features with easy log-in access, real-time tracking, and simplified data display. These features make the applications more intuitive and easy-to-use than patient portals. While apps have their own limitations and might serve different purposes, patient portals could adopt some high-yield features and functions of apps that lead to engagement success with patients. We thus suggest that to improve user experience with future portals, developers could look towards mHealth apps in design, function, and user interface. Adding new features to portals may improve their use and empower patients to track their overall health and disease states. Nevertheless, both these health IT tools should be subjected to rigorous evaluation to ensure they meet their potential in improving patient outcomes.

AB Background: The aim of the current study was to conduct a systematic review determining the effect of sport-specific mental health awareness programs to improve mental health knowledge and help-seeking among sports coaches, athletes and officials. The second aim was to review the study quality and to report on the validity of measures that were used to determine the effectiveness of programs.
   Methods: Sport-specific mental health awareness programs adopting an experimental or quasi-experimental design were included for synthesis. Six electronic databases were searched: PsycINFO, MEDLINE (OVID interface), Scopus, Cochrane, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus. Each database was searched from its year of inception to October 2016. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane and QATSQ tools.
   Results: Ten studies were included from the 1216 studies retrieved: four comprising coaches or service providers, one with officials, four with athletes, and one involved a combination of coaches and athletes. A range of outcomes was used to assess indices of mental health awareness and well-being. Mental health referral efficacy was improved in six studies, while three reported an increase in knowledge about mental health disorders. However, seven studies did not report effect sizes for their outcomes, limiting clinically meaningful interpretations. Furthermore, there was substantial heterogeneity and limited validity in the outcome measures of mental health knowledge and referral efficacy. Seven studies demonstrated a high risk of bias.
   Conclusions: Further, well-designed controlled intervention studies are required. Researchers, practitioners and policy makers should adhere to available methodological guidance and apply the psychological theory of behaviour change when developing and evaluating complex interventions.

AB Background: The "average" patient has a literacy level of US grade 8 (age 13-14 years), but this may be lower for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Current guidelines suggest that patient education materials should be pitched at a literacy level of around 5th grade (age 10-11 years). This study aims to evaluate the readability of written materials targeted at patients with CKD.
   Study Design: Systematic review.
   Setting & Population: Patient information materials aimed at adults with CKD and written in English.
   Search Strategy & Sources: Patient education materials designed to be printed and read, sourced from practices in Australia and online at all known websites run by relevant international CKD organizations during March 2014.
   Analytical Approach: Quantitative analysis of readability using Lexile Analyzer and Flesch-Kincaid tools.
   Results: We analyzed 80 materials. Both Lexile Analyzer and Flesch-Kincaid analyses suggested that most materials required a minimum of grade 9 (age 14-15 years) schooling to read them. Only 5% of materials were pitched at the recommended level (grade 5).
   Limitations: Readability formulas have inherent limitations and do not account for visual information. We did not consider other media through which patients with CKD may access information. Although the study covered materials from the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia, all noninternet materials were sourced locally, and it is possible that some international paper-based materials were missed. Generalizability may be limited due to exclusion of non-English materials.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that patient information materials aimed at patients with CKD are pitched above the average patient's literacy level. This issue is compounded by cognitive decline in patients with CKD, who may have lower literacy than the average patient. It suggests that information providers need to consider their audience more carefully when preparing patient information materials, including user testing with a low-literacy patient population.

AB Objective. To test optimal graphic risk communication formats for presenting small probabilities using graphics with a denominator of 1000 to adults with lower education and literacy. Methods. A randomized experimental study, which took place in adult basic education classes in Sydney, Australia. The participants were 120 adults with lower education and literacy. An experimental computer-based manipulation compared 1) pictographs in 2 forms, shaded "blocks'' and unshaded "dots''; and 2) bar charts across different orientations (horizontal/vertical) and numerator size (small <00, medium 100-499, large 500-999). Accuracy (size of error) and ease of processing (reaction time) were assessed on a gist task (estimating the larger chance of survival) and a verbatim task (estimating the size of difference). Preferences for different graph types were also assessed. Results. Accuracy on the gist task was very high across all conditions (>95%) and not tested further. For the verbatim task, optimal graph type depended on the numerator size. For small numerators, pictographs resulted in fewer errors than bar charts (blocks: odds ratio [OR] = 0.047, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.023-0.098; dots: OR = 0.049, 95% CI = 0.024-0.099). For medium and large numerators, bar charts were more accurate (e.g., medium dots: OR = 4.29, 95% CI = 2.9-6.35). Pictographs were generally processed faster for small numerators (e.g., blocks: 14.9 seconds v. bars: 16.2 seconds) and bar charts for medium or large numerators (e.g., large blocks: 41.6 seconds v. 26.7 seconds). Vertical formats were processed slightly faster than horizontal graphs with no difference in accuracy. Most participants preferred bar charts (64%); however, there was no relationship with performance. Conclusions. For adults with low education and literacy, pictographs are likely to be the best format to use when displaying small numerators (<100/1000) and bar charts for larger numerators (>100/1000).

AB Background: The optimal strategy for promoting self-care for heart failure (HF) is unclear.
   Methods and Results: We conducted a randomized trial to determine whether a "teach to goal" (TTG) educational and behavioral support program provided incremental benefits to a brief (1 hour) educational intervention (BEI) for knowledge, self-care behaviors, and HF-related quality of life (HFQOL). The TTG program taught use of adjusted-dose diuretics and then reinforced learning goals and behaviors with 5 to 8 telephone counseling sessions over 1 month. Participants' (n = 605) mean age was 61 years; 37% had marginal or inadequate literacy; 69% had ejection fraction <0.45; and 31% had Class III or IV symptoms. The TTG group had greater improvements in general and salt knowledge (P < .001) and greater increases in self-care behaviors (from mean 4.8 to 7.6 for TTG vs. 5.2 to 6.7 for BEI; P < .001). HFQOL improved from 58.5 to 64.6 for the TTG group but did not change for the BEI group (64.7 to 63.9; P < .001 for the difference in change scores). Improvements were similar regardless of participants' literacy level.
   Conclusions: Telephone reinforcement of learning goals and self-care behaviors improved knowledge, health behaviors, and HF-related QOL compared to a single education session. (J Cardiac Fail 2011;17:789-796)

AB Study design: Longitudinal study.
   Objectives: To examine the relationship between and predictors of quality of life (QOL) at 3 and 15 months post-rehabilitation discharge using the Disability Creation Process model as an explanatory framework.
   Setting: Vancouver, Canada.
   Methods: A consecutive sample of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) was enrolled in the study. Data were collected using the Quality of Life Index (QLI) and a variety of personal, participation and environmental instruments. On admission, 197 subjects were recruited, but dropouts and missing values led to the final inclusion of 93 cases in multiple regression models used to identify predictors of QOL at 3 and 15 months post-rehabilitation discharge.
   Results: Mean QLI group scores did not differ between 3 and 15 months (P = 0.85). Regression models accounted for 64% of variance in QLI total scores at 3 months and 70% of variance at 15 months. The main predictors of QOL at 3 months were health competence and mood state. The main predictors of QOL at 15 months were QOL level at 3 months, health competence and family support. At both time points, personal factors explained most of the variance, whereas participation and environmental factors were less significant.
   Conclusion: Given that health competence, mood state and some environmental factors may be amenable to modification, this study suggests interventions to mediate these variables might improve subjective QOL after SCI.

AB Prostate cancer (PrCA) is the most diagnosed cancer among men in the United States, especially among African American (AA) men. The purpose of this formative study was to explore the implications of applying Nutbeam's multidimensional health literacy framework to AA men's understanding of PrCA information. Participants were 25 AA men aged 45 and older in South Carolina. Their functional health literacy was assessed using two modified Cloze tests and the Shortened Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA). Men also participated in interviews or focus groups during which they were asked questions about PrCA risk, prevention, and screening. Transcripts were reviewed for recurrent themes and analyzed qualitatively using NVivo7. Mean S-TOFHLA was 28.28 (+/- 1.98), implying "adequate" comprehension. Mean Cloze was .71 (+/-.05) for a Grade 8 document and .66 (+/-.04) for a Grade 13 document, also showing "adequate" comprehension. Cloze scores for the Grade 8 resource were lower for participants with less education (P = .047). Despite having satisfactory literacy test scores, results from interviews and focus groups revealed participants' limited understanding and misconceptions about PrCA risk. Many wanted information about screening and family history delivered word-of-mouth by AA women and church pastors as few of them had ever received or actively sought out PrCA resources. Using Nutbeam's framework, gaps in health literacy which were not adequately captured by the validated tools emerged during the interviews and focus groups. Study findings provide important implications for PrCA communication with AA men to correct misperceptions about cancer risk and motivate preventive behaviors.

AB Objective: To assess the relationship between health literacy and compliance, disease awareness, and disease progression in patients with glaucoma.
   Methods: A cross-sectional observational study of 204 English-speaking patients treated for glaucoma for at least 1 year at Kresge Eye Institute was conducted. Health literacy was assessed using the standardized Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA). An oral questionnaire assessed patients' demographic information and glaucoma understanding. A retrospective medical record review was conducted to record parameters indicating glaucoma severity.
   Results: One hundred two participants (50%) were categorized as having poor functional health literacy ( mean [SD] TOFHLA score, 18.4 [7.5]) and 102 participants ( 50%) had adequate health literacy ( mean [ SD] TOFHLA score, 42.8 [5.1]). The poor health literacy group showed significant differences in income, education, medication compliance, glaucoma understanding, and missed appointments compared with the adequate health literacy group ( P <. 001). Patients with poor health literacy showed a greater visual field loss on initial presentation ( mean deviation [SD], -10.58 [9.3] dB) compared with the adequate health literacy group ( mean deviation [ SD], -7.79 [6.9] dB; P=.02) and significantly worse visual field parameters when comparing pattern SDs on the recent and the initial visual fields ( pattern SD change [ SD], 0.19 [2.5] dB in the poor health literacy group vs -0.7 [2.2] dB in the adequate health literacy group; P=.02).
   Conclusions: Patients with poor health literacy had poorer compliance, worse disease understanding, and greater disease progression compared with the adequate health literacy group, highlighting the need to promote health literacy in patients with glaucoma.

AB Background: Health illiteracy is a societal issue that, if addressed successfully, may help to reduce health disparities. It has been associated with increased rates of hospital admission, health care expenditures, and poor health outcomes. Because of this, much of the research in the United States has focused on adults in the health care system. This study investigated the effect of aspects of health literacy on the motivation to practice health-enhancing behaviors among early adolescents.
   Methods: Measures were generally based on 3 National Health Education Standards for grades 5-8. Data were obtained from 1178 9- to 13-year-old students visiting 11 health education centers in 7 states. Students responded via individual electronic keypads.
   Results: Multivariate logistic regression revealed that, in addition to age, difficulty understanding health information and belief that kids can do little to affect their future health, decreased the likelihood for interest in and desire to follow what they were taught about health. Further, low interest independently decreased motivation to follow what was taught. Girls were more likely to turn to school, parents, and medical personnel for health information. Older students were more likely to turn to school and to the Internet.
   Conclusions: Programs and curricula should be designed to increase student interest in health issues and their self-efficacy in controlling their own health destinies. Educators should also teach students to more effectively use nonconventional health information sources such as the Internet, parents, and medical professionals.

TI Understanding interpersonal communication processes across health

AB Interpersonal communication processes are central to the provider - patient interaction and in relationships with someone who is ill or needs care. The last decade of research has documented the ways communication processes predict better outcomes in the provider - patient interaction and key constructs for consideration in close relationships in which a health issue in some way defines the relationship. The current article highlights findings from the previous decade and the ways previous findings serve as a theoretical and methodological foundation for more sophisticated analysis of interpersonal communication processes in health contexts. A relational perspective serves as a link between the provider - patient relationship and close relationships with someone with a health issue. Implications for provider - patient contexts, medical education, and close relationships highlight future directions for theory building, health literacy, health outcomes, family communication, developmental issues, and a life span perspective.

AB The impact of an adherence enhancement program for low income HIV-infected Spanish-speaking Latinos on health literacy, patient-provider relationships, and adherence to HAART was examined. Evaluations were conducted at baseline, 6 weeks, and 6 months for participants (n = 85) randomly assigned to either the intervention group or a comparison group; 69 (81%) remained in the study for the entire 6-month duration. The intervention group scored significantly better than the comparison group on 3 of 5 measures of HIV health literacy at 6 weeks and on 2 of 5 measures, at 6 months. While there was a weak trend for the intervention group to report an increase in self-efficacy of medication adherence management, baseline to 6 weeks, no other changes were significant. Perceptions of the quality of relationship and communications with their HIV-treating physicians improved both at 6 weeks (p = 0.04) and at 6 months (p = 0.001). The comparison group showed little change baseline to 6 weeks and baseline to 6 months. While there was a trend for the pilot group to report better medication adherence, these differences were not statistically significant. Further evaluation of the impact of this adherence enhancement program is needed.

AB This study examined partner abuse and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as risk factors for suicidal behavior among women, and whether or not PTSD mediated the partner abuse-suicidal behavior association. Attempters (n = 119) were approximately three times more likely to be above clinical cut-points for physical partner abuse, nonphysical abuse, and PTSD than nonattempters (n = 85). Physical partner abuse, but not nonphysical partner abuse, was associated with an increased risk for PTSD. Further, PTSD mediated the link between physical partner abuse and suicidality, such that when PTSD was statistically controlled, the association between physical partner abuse and suicide attempt status was reduced to nonsignificance. Implications of findings for interventions for female victims of partner abuse, and women who make nonfatal suicide attempts are discussed.

AB There is a need to investigate which health information sources are used and trusted by people with limited health literacy to help identify strategies for addressing knowledge gaps that can contribute to preventable illness. We examined whether health literacy was associated with people's use of and trust in a range of potential health information sources. Six hundred participants from a GfK Internet survey panel completed an online survey. We assessed health literacy using the Newest Vital Sign, the sources participants used to get health information, and the extent to which participants trusted health information from these sources. We performed multivariable regressions, controlling for demographic characteristics. Lower health literacy was associated with lower odds of using medical websites for health information and with higher odds of using television, social media, and blogs or celebrity webpages. People with lower health literacy were less likely to trust health information from specialist doctors and dentists, but more likely to trust television, social media, blogs/celebrity webpages, friends, and pharmaceutical companies. People with limited health literacy had higher rates of using and trusting sources such as social media and blogs, which might contain lower quality health information compared to information from healthcare professionals. Thus, it might be necessary to enhance the public's ability to evaluate the quality of health information sources. The results of this study could be used to improve the reach of high-quality health information among people with limited health literacy and thereby increase the effectiveness of health communication programs and campaigns.

AB Objectives: To investigate whether intergroup contact in addition to education is more effective than education alone in reducing stigma of mental illness in adolescents.
   Design: A pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial compared education alone with education plus contact. Blocking was used to randomly stratify classes within schools to condition. Random allocation was concealed, generated by a computer algorithm, and undertaken after pretest. Data was collected at pretest and 2-week follow-up. Analyses use an intention-to-treat basis.
   Setting: Secondary schools in Birmingham, UK.
   Participants: The parents and guardians of all students in year 8 (age 12-13 years) were approached to take part.
   Interventions: A 1-day educational programme in each school led by mental health professional staff. Students in the 'contact' condition received an interactive session with a young person with lived experience of mental illness.
   Outcomes: The primary outcome was students' attitudinal stigma of mental illness. Secondary outcomes included knowledge-based stigma, mental health literacy, emotional well-being and resilience, and help-seeking attitudes.
   Results: Participants were recruited between 1 May 2011 and 30 April 2012. 769 participants completed the pretest and were randomised to condition. 657 (85%) provided follow-up data. At 2-week follow-up, attitudinal stigma improved in both conditions with no significant effect of condition (95% CI -0.40 to 0.22, p=0.5, d=0.01). Significant improvements were found in the education-alone condition compared with the contact and education condition for the secondary outcomes of knowledge-based stigma, mental health literacy, emotional well-being and resilience, and help-seeking attitudes.
   Conclusions: Contact was found to reduce the impact of the intervention for a number of outcomes. Caution is advised before employing intergroup contact with younger student age groups. The education intervention appeared to be successful in reducing stigma, promoting mental health knowledge, and increasing mental health literacy, as well as improving emotional well-being and resilience. A larger trial is needed to confirm these results.

AB Background. Home dialysis can offer improved quality of life and economic benefits compared with facility dialysis. Yet the uptake of home dialysis remains low around the world, which may be partly due to patients' lack of knowledge and barriers to shared and informed decision-making. We aimed to describe patient and caregiver values, beliefs and experiences when considering home dialysis, to inform strategies to align policy and practice with patients' needs.
   Methods. Semi-structured interviews with adult patients with chronic kidney disease Stage 4-5D (on dialysis <1 year) and their caregivers, recruited from three nephrology centres in New Zealand. Transcripts were analysed thematically.
   Results. In total, 43 patients [pre-dialysis (n = 18), peritoneal dialysis (n = 13), home haemodialysis (n = 4) and facility haemodialysis (n = 9)] and 9 caregivers participated. We identified five themes related to home dialysis: lacking decisional power (complexity of information, limited exposure to home dialysis, feeling disempowered, deprived of choice, pressure to choose), sustaining relationships (maintaining cultural involvement, family influence, trusting clinicians, minimizing social isolation), reducing lifestyle disruption (sustaining employment, avoiding relocation, considering additional expenses, seeking flexible schedules, creating free time), gaining confidence in choice (guarantee of safety, depending on professional certainty, reassurance from peers, overcoming fears) and maximizing survival.
   Conclusions. To engage and empower patients and caregivers to consider home dialysis, a stronger emphasis on the development of patient-focused educational programmes and resources is suggested. Pre-dialysis and home dialysis programmes that address health literacy and focus on cultural and social values may reduce fears and build confidence around decisions to undertake home dialysis. Financial burdensmay be minimized through provision of reimbursement programmes, employment support and additional assistance for patients, particularly those residing in remote areas.

TI Women's help-seeking behaviours for depressive symptoms during the

AB Objective: this study aims to characterize the help-seeking behaviours of women who were screened positive for perinatal depression, to investigate its sociodemographic and clinical correlates, and to characterize the perceived barriers that prevent women from seeking professional help.
   Design: cross-sectional internet survey.
   Setting: participants were recruited through advertisements published in pamphlets and posted on social media websites (e.g., Facebook) and websites and forums that focused on pregnancy and childbirth. Participants: 656 women (currently pregnant or who had a baby during the last 12 months) completed the survey.
   Measurements: participants were assessed with the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale, and were questioned about sociodemographic and clinical data, help-seeking behaviours and perceived barriers to help-seeking. Findings: different pathways of help-seeking were found, with only 13.6% of women with a perinatal depression seeking help for their emotional problems. Married women, currently pregnant women, and women without history of psychological problems had a higher likelihood of not engaging in any type of help-seeking behaviour. The majority of women who had not sought professional assistance identified several barriers to help-seeking, particularly knowledge barriers.
   Key conclusions: strategies to increase women's help-seeking behaviours should be implemented, namely improving mental health literacy, introducing screening procedures for mental health problems in pre/postnatal health care settings, and offering women innovative opportunities (e.g., web-based tools) that allow them to overcome the practical barriers to help-seeking.

AB Data on health literacy (HL) in the population is limited for Asian countries. This study aimed to test the validity of the Mandarin version of the European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire (HLS-EU-Q) for use in the general public in Taiwan. Multistage stratification random sampling resulted in a sample of 2989 people aged 15 years and above. The HLS-EU-Q was validated by confirmatory factor analysis with excellent model data fit indices. The general HL of the Taiwanese population was 34.4 +/- 6.6 on a scale of 50. Multivariate regression analysis showed that higher general HL is significantly associated with the higher ability to pay for medication, higher self-perceived social status, higher frequency of watching health-related TV, and community involvement but associated with younger age. HL is also associated with health status, health behaviors, and health care accessibility and use. The HLS-EU-Q was found to be a useful tool to assess HL and its associated factors in the general population.

AB BACKGROUND: We sought to investigate the degree to which cognitive skills explain associations between health literacy and asthma-related medication use among older adults with asthma.
   METHODS: Patients aged >= 60 years receiving care at eight outpatient clinics (primary care, geriatrics, pulmonology, allergy, and immunology) in New York, New York, and Chicago, Illinois, were recruited to participate in structured, in-person interviews as part of the Asthma Beliefs and Literacy in the Elderly (ABLE) study (n = 425). Behaviors related to medication use were investigated, including adherence to prescribed regimens, metered-dose inhaler (MDI) technique, and dry powder inhaler (DPI) technique. Health literacy was measured using the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults. Cognitive function was assessed in terms of fluid (working memory, processing speed, executive function) and crystallized (verbal) ability.
   RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 68 years; 40% were Hispanic and 30% non-Hispanic black. More than one-third (38%) were adherent to their controller medication, 53% demonstrated proper DPI technique, and 38% demonstrated correct MDI technique. In multivariable analyses, limited literacy was associated with poorer adherence to controller medication (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.29-4.08) and incorrect DPI (OR, 3.51; 95% CI, 1.81-6.83) and MDI (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.01-2.65) techniques. Fluid and crystallized abilities were independently associated with medication behaviors. However, when fluid abilities were added to the model, literacy associations were reduced.
   CONCLUSIONS: Among older patients with asthma, interventions to promote proper medication use should simplify tasks and patient roles to overcome cognitive load and suboptimal performance in self-care.

TI The Association of Health Literacy with Illness and Medication Beliefs

SO PLOS ONE

   VALIDATION; MORTALITY; PATTERNS; OUTCOMES
AB Background
   Low health literacy is associated with low adherence to self-management in many chronic diseases. Additionally, health beliefs are thought to be determinants of self-management behaviors. In this study we sought to determine the association, if any, of health literacy and health beliefs among elderly individuals with COPD.
   Methods
   We enrolled a cohort of patients with COPD from two academic urban settings in New York, NY and Chicago, IL. Health literacy was measured using the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults. Using the framework of the Self-Regulation Model, illness and medication beliefs were measured with the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (B-IPQ) and Beliefs about Medications Questionnaire (BMQ). Unadjusted analyses, with corresponding Cohen's d effect sizes, and multiple logistic regression were used to assess the relationships between HL and illness and medication beliefs.
   Results
   We enrolled 235 participants, 29% of whom had low health literacy. Patients with low health literacy were more likely to belong to a racial minority group (p<0.001), not be married (p = 0.006), and to have lower income (p<0.001) or education (p<0.001). In unadjusted analyses, patients with low health literacy were less likely to believe they will always have COPD (p = 0.003, Cohen's d = 0.42), and were more likely to be concerned about their illness ((p = 0.04, Cohen's d = 0.17). In analyses adjusted for sociodemographic factors and other health beliefs, patients with low health literacy were less likely to believe that they will always have COPD (odds ratio [OR]: 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65-0.94). In addition, the association of low health literacy with expressed concern about medications remained significant (OR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.05-1.37) though the association of low health literacy with belief in the necessity of medications was no longer significant (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.82-1.04).
   Conclusions
   In this cohort of urban individuals with COPD, low health literacy was prevalent, and associated with illness beliefs that predict decreased adherence. Our results suggest that targeted strategies to address low health literacy and related illness and medications beliefs might improve COPD medication adherence and other self-management behaviors.

AB Health literacy represents the communication among patients, their social networks, providers, and health systems to promote patients' understanding and engagement in their care. This is particularly relevant in kidney disease, in which the complexity of the medical condition and the extent of the health-care team require strategies to overcome health-literacy-related barriers. Limited literacy is common in patients with all stages of kidney disease and is associated with important outcomes, including reduced knowledge, less adherence, hospitalization, and death. A growing understanding and characterization of the health system, or organizational health literacy, may further our understanding of this dynamic relationship. Although various valid methods exist, assessment of health literacy within individuals or systematically within care settings has not been routinely performed. This may be in part due to the limited research in kidney-specific strategies to address limited health literacy. Future research to understand the mechanisms of health literacy will permit targeted, efficient interventions to bridge gaps and improve outcomes even in patients with complex kidney disease.

AB Objective. To identify instruments used to measure health literacy and numeracy in people with diabetes; evaluate their use, measurement scope, and properties; discuss their strengths and weaknesses; and propose the most useful, reliable, and applicable measure for use in research and practice settings. Methods. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify the instruments. Nutbeam's domains of health literacy and a diabetes health literacy skill set were used to evaluate the measurement scope of the identified instruments and to evaluate their applicability in people with diabetes. Results. Fifty-six studies were included, from which one diabetes-specific (LAD) and eight generic measures of health literacy (REALM, REALM-R, TOFHLA, s-TOFHLA, NVS, 3-brief SQ, 3-level HL Scale, SILS) and one diabetes-specific (DNT) and two generic measures of numeracy (SNS, WRAT) were identified. These instruments were categorized into direct measures, that is, instruments that assess the performance of individuals on health literacy skills and indirect measures that rely on self-report of these skills. The most commonly used instruments measure selective domains of health literacy, focus mainly on reading and writing skills, and do not address other important skills such as verbal communication, health care system navigation, health-related decision making, and numeracy. The structure, mode, and length of administration and measurement properties were found to affect the applicability of these instruments in clinical and research settings. Indirect self- or clinician-administered measures are the most useful in both clinical and research settings. Conclusion. This review provides an evaluation of available health literacy measures and guidance to practitioners and researchers for selecting the appropriate measures for use in clinical settings and research applications.

AB The report "Healthy people'' from the US Department of Health and Human Services defines health literacy (HL) as follows: "The degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.'' The same report identifies asthma as a public health problem of high priority. Unfortunately, impaired HL is prevalent in our society, and patients with low HL and asthma face multiple challenges as they attempt to manage their disease. Indeed, the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program's current guidelines require patients to have considerable HL and self-management skills. Numerous studies have linked inadequate literacy with poor health outcomes. Unlike many sociodemographic variables, HL can potentially be addressed in the health care setting. The purpose of this review is to raise awareness of the problem, summarize the current evidence linking HL and asthma, and offer strategies to strengthen the communication between patients and health care providers to decrease asthma health disparities. In addition, we discuss potential future directions for research in this field. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2012;129:935-42.)

TI Health literacy awareness training for healthcare workers: Improving
   knowledge and intentions to use clear communication techniques
SO PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING

ID QUALITY
AB Objective: Health literacy is a growing concern as its relationship with health outcomes becomes clearer. Efforts to enhance awareness of patient health literacy in health professional education have focused on physicians, and the objective of this research was to provide an initial assessment of a training session designed for healthcare workers of all kinds.
   Methods: Pre-and post-surveys were completed by 166 participants (N = 166) in training sessions designed to improve knowledge of health literacy and instruction in clear communication techniques. Participants provided baseline and post-training assessments of perceived knowledge of health literacy and use of strategies to improve communication with low health literate audiences.
   Results: Participants, initially overestimating their own knowledge of health literacy, improved on outcome measures regarding perceived health literacy knowledge. Participants also indicated strong intentions to use clear communication techniques covered in the training.
   Conclusion: Results suggest there is an opportunity and need to improve health literacy training for healthcare workers of all kinds. Widespread adoption of health literacy training programs would improve the delivery of healthcare to low health literate patients.
   Practice implications: Participants initially overestimated their knowledge of health literacy, suggesting a need to improve initial training and continuing medical education regarding health literacy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Diabetes self-management is a key element in the overall management of diabetes. Identifying barriers to disease self-management is a critical step in achieving optimal health outcomes. Our goal was to explore patients' perceptions about barriers to self-management of diabetes that could possibly help explain poor health outcomes among minority patients.
   Study Design: Four focus groups were conducted among 31 predominately African American patients with diabetes who were enrolled in the Baltimore Cardiovascular Partnership Study, a NIH-funded multiyear prospective partnership study. The topic guide consisted of a series of open-ended questions about knowledge of current health status, medication use, continuity of care, blood glucose level and nutrition.
   Results: The focus groups confirmed that previously reported barriers to self-management persisted and identified new concerns that could be associated with poor health outcomes among minority patients with diabetes. Attitudes, perceptions and behaviors surrounding diabetes and self-management of the condition did vary across individuals, however, the variation appeared to reflect the individual's knowledge and opinions rather than patient's age, sex, or culture. The primary barrier to diabetes self-management resulted from lack of knowledge of target blood glucose and blood pressure. Several participants found some of the health information to be quite confusing.
   Conclusions: Diabetes is a major public health concern and the lack of awareness of target blood glucose and blood pressure further complicates the problem. The limited health literacy seen in this study could help explain several of the barriers to self-management. The barriers to self-management identified in this qualitative study are amenable to intervention that could improve health outcomes. (Ethn Dis. 2011;21:27-32)

AB Objectives: This study examined the levels of genetic knowledge, health literacy and beliefs about causation of health conditions among individuals in different age groups. Methods: Individuals (n = 971) recruited through 8 community health centers in Suffolk County, New York, completed a one-time survey. Results: Levels of genetic knowledge were lower among individuals in older age groups (26-35, p = 0.011; 36-49, p = 0.002; 50 years and older, p < 0.001) compared to those in the youngest age group (18-25). Participants in the oldest age group also had lower health literacy than those in the youngest group (p < 0.001). Those in the oldest group were more likely to endorse genetic (OR = 1.87, p = 0.008) and less likely to endorse behavioral factors like diet, exercise and smoking (OR = 0.55, p = 0.010) as causes of a person's body weight than those in the youngest group. Higher levels of genetic knowledge were associated with higher likelihood of behavioral attribution for body weight (OR = 1.25, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Providing additional information that compensates for their lower genetic knowledge may help individuals in older age groups benefit from rapidly emerging genetic health information more fully. Increasing the levels of genetic knowledge about common complex diseases may help motivate individuals to engage in health promoting behaviors to maintain healthy weight through increases in behavioral causal attributions.

TI Interventions for enhancing consumers' online health literacy
SO COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS

DT Review

   CANCER-PATIENTS; DIGITAL DIVIDE; INTERNET USE; PEOPLE; ACCESS;
   POPULATIONS
AB Background
   Access to health information is critical to enable consumers to participate in decisions on health. Increasingly, such information is accessed via the internet, but a number of barriers prevent consumers making effective use of it. These barriers include inadequate skills to search, evaluate and use the information. It has not yet been demonstrated whether training consumers to use the internet for health information can result in positive health outcomes.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects of interventions for enhancing consumers' online health literacy (skills to search, evaluate and use online health information).
   Search strategy
   We searched: the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group Specialised Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1 2008); MEDLINE (Ovid); EMBASE (Ovid); CINAHL (Dialog); ERIC (CSA Illumina); LISA (CSA Illumina); PsycINFO (Ovid); Index to scientific and technical proceedings; SIGLE; ASLIB Index to Theses; ProQuest Dissertation Abstracts; National Research Register/UK CRN Portfolio database; Current Controlled Trials - MetaRegister of Controlled Trials. We searched all databases for the period January 1990 to March 2008.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs and associated economic evaluations, quasi-RCTs, interrupted time series analyses, and controlled before and after (CBA) studies assessing interventions to enhance consumers' online health literacy, in any language.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed their quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for clarification and to seek missing data. We presented results as a narrative and tabular summary, and calculated mean differences where appropriate.
   Main results
   We included two studies: one randomised controlled trial (RCT) and one controlled before and after (CBA) study with a combined total of 470 participants. The RCT compared internet health information classes with patient education classes for participants with HIV infection. Only the RCT, which we rated as having a moderate risk of bias, reported statistically significant positive effects for primary outcomes related to online health literacy in the intervention group, for the following outcomes: 'Self-efficacy for health information seeking', 'health information evaluation skills' and the 'number of times the patient discussed online information with a health provider'. The CBA, which we rated as having a high risk of bias, compared internet health information classes with a control group receiving no intervention among healthy adults aged 50+. It showed significant positive changes only in a secondary (behavioural) outcome in the intervention group, regarding the readiness to adopt the internet as a tool for preventive health information. No adverse effects were reported. There is low quality evidence that such interventions may improve some outcomes relevant to online health literacy in certain populations.
   Authors' conclusions
   Due to the small number of studies and their variable methodological quality, the evidence is too weak to draw any conclusions about implications for the design and delivery of interventions for online health literacy. There is a need for well-designed RCTs to investigate the effects of such interventions. These should involve different participants (in terms of disease status, age, socio-economic group and gender) to analyse the extent to which online health literacy reduces a barrier to using the internet for health information. Trials should be conducted in different settings and should examine interventions to enhance consumers' online health literacy (search, appraisal and use of online health information) like internet training courses, measuring outcomes up to at least one year after the intervention to estimate the sustainability of the intervention effects.

AB Background and objectives: In the United States, relatively little is known about clinical outcomes of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in vulnerable populations utilizing public health systems. The primary study objectives were to describe patient characteristics, incident ESRD, and mortality in adults with nondialysis-dependent CKD receiving care in the health care safety net.
   Design, setting, participants, & measurements: Time to ESRD and time to death were examined among a cohort of 15,353 ambulatory adults with nondialysis-dependent CKD from the Community Health Network of San Francisco.
   Results: The mean age of the CKD cohort was 59.0 +/- 13.8 years; 50% of the cohort was younger than 60 years and 26% was younger than 50 years. Most (72%) were members of nonwhite racial-ethnic groups, 73% were indigent (annual income <$15,000) and 18% were uninsured. In adjusted analyses, blacks [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval), 4.00 (2.99 to 5.35)], Hispanics [2.20 (1.46 to 3.30)], and Asians/Pacific Islanders [3.84 (2.73 to 5.40)] had higher risks of progression to ESRD than non-Hispanic whites. The higher risk of progression to ESRD among nonwhite compared with white persons with CKD was not explained by lower relative mortality.
   Conclusions: Adults with CKD stages 3 to 5 cared for within an urban public health system were relatively young and predominantly nonwhite both factors associated with a higher risk of progression to ESRD. These findings call for targeted efforts to assess the burden and progression of CKD within other public and safety-net health systems in this country.

AB Background: The potential contribution of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) modalities to promote and support critical health literacy has not received substantial attention within either the health promotion or the CAM literature. This paper explores the potential of one CAM modality, shiatsu, in promoting well-being and critical health literacy.
   Methods: Data are drawn from a longitudinal, 6 months observational, pragmatic study of the effects and experience of shiatsu within three European countries (Austria, Spain and the UK). Client postal questionnaires included: advice received, changes made 6 months later, clients 'hopes' from having shiatsu and features of the client-practitioner relationship.
   Result: At baseline, three-quarters of clients (n = 633) received advice, on exercise, diet, posture, points to work on at home or other ways of self-care. At 6 months follow-up, about four-fifths reported making changes to their lifestyle 'as a result of having shiatsu treatment', including taking more rest and relaxation or exercise, changing their diet, reducing time at work and other changes such as increased body/mind awareness and levels of confidence and resolve. Building on the findings, an explanatory model of possible ways that a CAM therapy could contribute to health promotion is presented to guide future research, both within and beyond CAM.
   Conclusion: Supporting individuals to take control of their self-care requires advice-giving within a supportive treatment context and practitioner relationship, with clients who are open to change and committed to maintaining their health. CAM modalities may have an important role to play in this endeavour.

AB Objective To investigate the influence of patient factors on patients' reading and seeking of written medicine information (WMI).
   Design A cross-sectional questionnaire study.
   Main variables studied Patient's health locus of control, coping style, health literacy, demographics and disease state (independent variables) and patient's interest and likelihood in reading and seeking WMI (dependent variables).
   Main outcome measures Patient factors predicting interest in reading and seeking WMI.
   Setting and participants Patients (total n = 479) from three Rheumatology/Pain clinics in teaching hospitals (n = 217) and 40 community pharmacies (n = 262) in metropolitan Sydney, Australia.
   Results The majority of patients were interested and likely to read WMI about their prescription medicines. However, not many were likely to seek WMI and not many frequently sought WMI. Using logistic regression, patients' interest in reading WMI was predicted by their coping style [monitor vs. blunter, odds ratio (OR) = 2.19, confidence interval (CI) = 1.17-4.10], health literacy levels (adequate vs. inadequate/marginal, OR = 2.86, CI = 1.16-7.05) and occupation (blue-collar vs. homemaker, OR = 3.42, CI = 0.09-0.88) whilst patients' interest in seeking WMI was predicted by their disease state (pain/rheumatology condition vs. hypertension, OR = 1.84, CI = 1.11-3.05), health locus of control (powerful other, OR = 0.95, CI = 0.90-0.99) and health literacy levels (adequate vs. inadequate/marginal, OR = 2.7, CI = 1.17-6.39).
   Conclusions Patients' interest in reading and seeking WMI were influenced by several patient factors including disease state, health locus of control, coping style, health literacy levels and occupation. Furthermore, the results highlighted that reading and seeking WMI were regarded as distinct activities influenced by different factors. These findings may guide health professionals in assessing the utility of WMI for different patient groups and more broadly in the tailoring of patient education to meet patient needs.

AB Background: To date, there has been very little work investigating behaviour changes induced by interventions that are designed to increase help seeking. The present paper examines the effects of two Internet depression websites on help seeking.
   Methods: 414 individuals with elevated scores on a depression assessment scale were randomly allocated to a depression information website, a cognitive-behavioural skills training website (CBT) or an attention control condition. Reports of help seeking for specific treatments, from specific sources and for categories of treatments were assessed.
   Results: Relative to the control, the depression information site was associated with decreases in seeking support from friends and family, the use of music and of everyday treatments and no increase in seeking evidence based interventions. The CBT site was associated with the report of help seeking for CBT, massage and exercise.
   Conclusion: Methods to encourage the use of evidence-based treatments need further research to determine whether the assistance sought is evidence based and whether there are unintended effects.

AB Individuals with a lower education level frequently have unhealthier behaviors than individuals with a higher education level, but the pathway is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate whether health literacy mediates the association between educational attainment and health behavior (smoking, physical inactivity, poor diet) and obesity. The study included respondents ages 25 years or older drawn from a large population-based survey conducted in 2013 (N = 29,473). Two scales from the Health Literacy Questionnaire were used: (a) Understanding health information well enough to know what to do and (b) Ability to actively engage with health care providers. Multiple mediation analyses were conducted using the Karlson-Holm-Breen method. The study showed that health literacy in general and the ability to understand health information in particular mediated the relationship between educational attainment and health behavior, especially in relation to being physically inactive (accounting for 20% of the variance), having a poor diet (accounting for 13% of the variance), and being obese (accounting for 16% of the variance). These findings suggest that strategies for improving health behavior and reducing health inequalities may benefit from adopting a stronger focus on health literacy within prevention, patient education, and other public health interventions.

AB Objective: Almost 80% of Australian Internet users seek out health information online so the readability of this information is important. This study aimed to evaluate the readability of Australian online health information and determine if it matches the average reading level of Australians. Methods: Two hundred and fifty-one web pages with information on 12 common health conditions were identified across sectors. Readability was assessed by the Flesch-Kincaid (F-K), Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) and Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) formulas, with grade 8 adopted as the average Australian reading level. Results: The average reading grade measured by F-K and SMOG was 10.54 and 12.12 respectively. The mean FRE was 47.54, a difficult-to-read' score. Only 0.4% of web pages were written at or below grade 8 according to SMOG. Information on dementia was the most difficult to read overall, while obesity was the most difficult among government websites. Conclusions and implications: The findings suggest that the readability of Australian health websites is above the average Australian levels of reading. A quantifiable guideline is needed to ensure online health information accommodates the reading needs of the general public to effectively use the Internet as an enabler of health literacy.

ID AGE
AB Low health literacy is common among aging patients and is a risk factor for morbidity and mortality. We aimed to describe health literacy decline during aging and to investigate the roles of cognitive function and decline in determining health literacy decline.
   Data were from 5,256 non-cognitively impaired adults aged a parts per thousand yen 52 years in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Health literacy was assessed using a four-item reading comprehension assessment of a fictitious medicine label, and cognitive function was assessed in a battery administered in-person at baseline (2004-2005) and at follow-up (2010-2011).
   Overall, 19.6 % (1,032/5,256) of participants declined in health literacy score over the follow-up. Among adults aged a parts per thousand yen 80 years at baseline, this proportion was 38.2 % (102/267), compared to 14.8 % (78/526) among adults aged 52-54 years (OR = 3.21; 95 % CI: 2.26-4.57). Other sociodemographic predictors of health literacy decline were: male sex (OR = 1.20; 95 % CI: 1.04-1.38), non-white ethnicity (OR = 2.42; 95 % CI: 1.51-3.89), low educational attainment (OR = 1.58; 95 % CI: 1.29-1.95 for no qualifications vs. degree education), and low occupational class (OR = 1.67; 95 % CI: 1.39-2.01 for routine vs. managerial occupations). Higher baseline cognitive function scores protected against health literacy decline, while cognitive decline (yes vs. no) predicted decline in health literacy score (OR = 1.59; 95 % CI: 1.35-1.87 for memory decline and OR = 1.56; 95 % CI: 1.32-1.85 for executive function decline).
   Health literacy decline appeared to increase with age, and was associated with even subtle cognitive decline in older non-impaired adults. Striking social inequalities were evident, whereby men and those from minority and deprived backgrounds were particularly vulnerable to literacy decline. Health practitioners must be able to recognize limited health literacy to ensure that clinical demands match the literacy skills of diverse patients.

AB Background: After more than three years of violence in Syria, Lebanon hosts over one million Syrian refugees creating significant public health concerns. Antenatal care delivery to tens of thousands of pregnant Syrian refugee women is critical to preventing maternal and fetal mortality but is not well characterized given the multiple factors obtaining health data in a displaced population. This study describes antenatal care access, the scope of existing antenatal care, and antenatal and family planning behaviors and practice among pregnant Syrian refugees in various living conditions and multiple geographic areas of Lebanon.
   Methods: A field-based survey was conducted between July and October 2013 in 14 main geographic sites of refugee concentration. The assessment evaluated antenatal services among a non-randomized sample of 420 self-identified pregnant Syrian refugee women that included demographics, gestational age, living accommodation, antenatal care coverage, antenatal care content, antenatal health behaviors, antenatal health literacy, and family planning perception and practices.
   Results: In total, 420 pregnant Syrian refugees living in Lebanon completed the survey. Of these, 82.9% (348) received some antenatal care. Of those with at least one antenatal visit, 222 (63.8%) received care attended by a skilled professional three or more times, 111 (31.9%) 1-2 times, and 15 (4.3%) had never received skilled antenatal care. We assessed antenatal care content defined by blood pressure measurement, and urine and blood sample analyses. Of those who had received any antenatal care, only 31.2% received all three interventions, 18.2% received two out of three, 32.1% received one out of three, and 18.5% received no interventions. Only (41.2%) had an adequate diet of vitamins, minerals, and folic acid. Access, content and health behaviors varied by gestational age, type of accommodation and location in Lebanon.
   Conclusions: Standards of antenatal care are not being met for pregnant Syrian refugee women in Lebanon. This descriptive analysis of relative frequencies suggests reproductive health providers should focus attention on increasing antenatal care visits, particularly to third trimester and late gestational age patients and to those in less secure sheltering arrangements. With this approach they can improve care content by providing early testing and interventions per accepted guidelines designed to improve pregnancy outcomes.

ID KNOWLEDGE
AB Background: Mental Health Literacy (MHL) has become an important concept in the literature; however, quantitative research on MHL methodology has been limited.
   Aims: This review identified peer-reviewed papers investigating MHL, assessed psychometric attributes of scale-based measures of MHL, and the extent that studies assessed the attributes that define MHL.
   Method: A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted to identify measures which generate a total MHL or subscale score was also conducted. A total of 13 studies were identified and their psychometric attributes determined using the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN). The extent to which each measure assessed the attributes of MHL was also determined.
   Results: Results showed that included studies failed to report detailed information about the sample, measure development and testing to demonstrate the psychometric properties of their tool.
   Conclusion: There are substantial limitations in current ability to measure MHL and there is significant scope for the development and evaluation of psychometrically robust measures that assess the relevant attributes of MHL. Further research could also focus on the adequacy of the current definition of MHL.

AB Objective. Treat-to-target guidelines promote shared decision making (SDM) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Also, because of high cost and potential toxicity of therapies. SDM is central to patient safety. Our objective was to examine patterns of perceived communication around decision making in 2 cohorts of adults with RA.
   Methods. Data were derived from patients enrolled in 1 of 2 longitudinal, observational cohorts [University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) RA Cohort and RA Panel Cohort]. Subjects completed a telephone interview in their preferred language that included a measure of patient-provider communication, including items about decision making. Measures of trust in physician, education, and language proficiency were also asked, Logistic regression was performed to identify correlates of suboptimal SDM communication. Analyses were performed on each sample separately.
   Results. Of 509 patients across 2 cohorts, 30% and 32% reported suboptimal SDM communication. Low trust in physician was independently associated with suboptimal SDM communication in both cohorts. Older age and limited English proficiency were independently associated with suboptimal SDM in the UCSF RA Cohort, as was limited health literacy in the RA Panel Cohort.
   Conclusion. This study of over 500 adults with RA from 2 demographically distinct cohorts found that nearly one-third of subjects report suboptimal SDM communication with their clinicians, regardless of cohort. Lower trust in physician was independently associated with suboptimal SDM communication in both cohorts, as was limited English language proficiency and older age in the UCSF RA Cohort and limited health literacy in the RA Panel Cohort. These findings underscore the need to examine the influence of SDM on health outcomes in RA.

TI Associations Among Health Literacy, Diabetes Knowledge, and
   Self-Management Behavior in Adults with Diabetes: Results of a Dutch
   Cross-Sectional Study
SO JOURNAL OF HEALTH COMMUNICATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CARE
AB Various studies have examined the association between health literacy and self-management behavior, but few have explored ways through which this occurs. The present study examines to what extent health literacy is associated with diabetes self-management behavior and to what extent diabetes knowledge is a mechanism in this association. The study was based on cross-sectional data retrieved from patient registrations and questionnaires completed in 2010. The sample included 1,714 predominantly type 2 diabetes patients, with a mean age of 67 years. Diabetes self-management was indicated by HbA1c level, glucose self-control and self-reported monitoring of glucose levels, physical activity, and smoking. Multilevel analyses were applied based on multiple imputed data. Lower health literacy was significantly associated with less diabetes knowledge, higher HbA1c level, less self-control of glucose level, and less physical activity. Participants with more diabetes knowledge were less likely to smoke and more likely to control glucose levels. Diabetes knowledge was a mediator in the association between health literacy and glucose self-control and between health literacy and smoking. This study indicates that higher health literacy may contribute to participation in certain self-management activities, in some cases through diabetes knowledge. Diabetes knowledge and health literacy skills may be important targets for interventions promoting diabetes self-management.

AB Fotonovelas-small booklets that portray a dramatic story using photographs and captions-represent a powerful health education tool for low-literacy and ethnic minority audiences. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a depression fotonovela in increasing depression knowledge, decreasing stigma, increasing self-efficacy to recognize depression, and increasing intentions to seek treatment, relative to a text pamphlet. Hispanic adults attending a community adult school (N = 157, 47.5 % female, mean age = 35.8 years, 84 % immigrants, 63 % with less than high school education) were randomly assigned to read the fotonovela or a low-literacy text pamphlet about depression. They completed surveys before reading the material, immediately after reading the material, and 1 month later. The fotonovela and text pamphlet both produced significant improvements in depression knowledge and self-efficacy to identify depression, but the fotonovela produced significantly larger reductions in antidepressant stigma and mental health care stigma. The fotonovela also was more likely to be passed on to family or friends after the study, potentially increasing its reach throughout the community. Results indicate that fotonovelas can be useful for improving health literacy among underserved populations, which could reduce health disparities.

AB Study Objective. To assess the effect of health literacy on drug adherence in the context of a pharmacist-based intervention for patients with heart failure.
   Design. Post hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial.
   Setting. Inner-city ambulatory care practice affiliated with an academic medical center.
   Patients. The original trial enrolled 314 patients with heart failure who were aged 50 years or older and were taking at least one cardiovascular drug for heart failure; 122 patients received the pharmacist intervention (patient education, therapeutic monitoring, and communication with primary care providers), and 192 patients received usual care (regular follow-up with primary care providers). We analyzed the results of 281 patients who had available health literacy and adherence data.
   Measurements and Main Results. Drug adherence was assessed over 9 months using electronic prescription container monitors on cardiovascular drugs. Health literacy was assessed using the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (scores range from 0-36, with an adequate literacy score defined as >= 23). Taking adherence, defined as the percentage of prescribed drug doses taken by the patient compared with the number of doses prescribed by the physician, was assessed for each group. Patients were a mean +/- SD of 63 +/- 9 years old, 51% had less than 12 years of education, 29% had inadequate health literacy, and they received a mean +/- SD of 11 +/- 4 drugs. In the usual care group, taking adherence was greater among patients with adequate (69.4%) than those with inadequate (54.2%) health literacy (p=0.001). In the intervention group, the difference in taking adherence among patients with adequate (77.3%) and inadequate (65.3%) health literacy was not statistically significant (p=0.06). Among patients with inadequate health literacy, the intervention increased adherence (65%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 54-77%) by an order of magnitude similar to that of the baseline adherence of patients with adequate health literacy (69%, 95% CI 65-74%). Multivariable analysis supported the association between health literacy and adherence.
   Conclusion. In patients with heart failure, those with adequate health literacy have better adherence to cardiovascular drugs than those with inadequate health literacy. The pharmacist intervention improved adherence in patients with adequate and inadequate health literacy. Health literacy may be an important consideration in drug adherence interventions.

AB Objectives/Hypothesis: Numerous professional societies, clinical practices, and hospitals provide Internet-based patient education materials (PEMs) to the general public, but not all of this information is written at a reading level appropriate for the average patient. The National Institutes of Health and the US Department of Health and Human Services recommend that PEMs be written at or below the sixth-grade level. Our purpose was to assess the readability of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS)-related PEMs available on the Internet and compare readability levels of PEMs provided by three sources: professional societies, clinical practices, and hospitals. Study Design: A descriptive and correlational design was used for this study. Methods: The readability of 31 ESS-related PEMs was assessed with four different readability indices: Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES), Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG), and Gunning Frequency of Gobbledygook (Gunning FOG). Averages were evaluated against national recommendations and between each source using analysis of variance and t tests. Results: The majority of PEMs (96.8%) were written above the recommended sixth-grade reading level, based on FKGL (P < .001). Only one article (3.2%) had an FKGL at or below the sixth-grade level. The mean readability values were: FRES 47.1 +/- 13.4, FKGL 10.7 +/- 2.4, SMOG 13.7 +/- 1.6, and Gunning FOG 12.4 +/- 2.7. Conclusions: Current Internet-based PEMs related to ESS, regardless of source type, were written well above the recommended sixth-grade level. Materials from the hospitals/university-affiliated websites had lower readability scores, but were still above recommended levels. Web-based PEMs pertaining to ESS should be written with the average patient in mind. Laryngoscope, 2012

AB Background and objectives Although limited health literacy is estimated to affect over 90 million Americans and is recognized as an important public health concern, there have been few studies examining this issue in patients with chronic kidney disease. We sought to characterize the prevalence of and associations of demographic and clinical characteristics with limited health literacy in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis.
   Design, setting, participants, & measurements As part of a prospective clinical trial of symptom management strategies in 288 patients treated with chronic hemodialysis, we assessed health literacy using the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM). We defined limited health literacy as a REALM score and evaluated independent associations of demographic and baseline clinical characteristics with limited health literacy using multivariable logistic regression.
   Results Of the 260 patients who completed the REALM, 41 demonstrated limited health literacy. AfricanAmerican race, lower educational level, and veteran status were independently associated with limited health literacy. There was no association of limited health literacy with age, gender, serologic values, dialysis adequacy, overall symptom burden, quality of life, or depression.
   Conclusions Limited health literacy is common among patients receiving chronic hemodialysis. AfricanAmerican race and socioeconomic factors are strong independent predictors of limited health literacy. These findings can help inform the design and implementation of interventions to improve health literacy in the hemodialysis population.

AB We conducted a systematic literature review, using the RE-AIM framework, with the goal of determining what information is available to inform research to practice translation of health promotion interventions developed to address health literacy. Thirty-one articles reflecting 25 trials published between 2000 and 2010 met inclusion criteria. Two researchers coded each article, using a validated RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness/efficacy, adoption, implementation, maintenance) data extraction tool, and group meetings were used to gain consensus on discrepancies. Across all studies (14 randomized controlled trials, 11 quasi-experimental; 24 clinic-based, 1 community-based), the mean level of reporting RE-AIM indicators varied by dimension (reach = 69%; efficacy/effectiveness = 58%; adoption = 36%; %; implementation = 35%; maintenance = 11%). Among participants enrolled in the 25 interventions, approximately 38% were identified as low health literate. Only eight of the studies examined health literacy status as a moderator of intervention effectiveness. This review suggests that the current research on health promotion for participants with low health literacy provides insufficient information to conclude whether interventions for health literacy can attract the target population, achieve an effect that is sustainable, or be generalized outside of clinical settings. Recommendations for enhancing the design and reporting of these trials are provided.

AB The objective of this study was to conduct an evaluation of Reach Out Central (ROC), an online gaming program designed to support the mental health of people aged 16-25. The evaluation sought to determine the benefit of playing ROC on alcohol use, use of coping strategies, psychological distress, resilience and satisfaction with life. Changes in mental health literacy, mental health stigma and willingness to seek help and program satisfaction were also investigated. A single group (N = 266) quasi-experimental repeated measures (pre-, post-program, 2-month follow-up) design was employed. The results demonstrated positive improvements across all outcome measures for females; however, a non-significant worsening effect was observed for males on seeking support, avoidance and resilience. Improvements for both genders were observed on mental health literacy and help-seeking. However, literacy levels and help-seeking were significantly higher, and stigma significantly lower for females. Program satisfaction ratings were high irrespective of gender. Although some inconsistencies between genders were noted, ROC appears to enhance protective factors for the prevention or early intervention of mental health disorders. The results of this study need to be viewed with its limitations in mind, specifically, the use of an open trial methodology and the small number of male participants.

TI Innovative health service delivery models in low and middle income
   countries - what can we learn from the private sector?
SO HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Review
AB Background: The poor in low and middle income countries have limited access to health services due to limited purchasing power, residence in underserved areas, and inadequate health literacy. This produces significant gaps in health care delivery among a population that has a disproportionately large burden of disease. They frequently use the private health sector, due to perceived or actual gaps in public services. A subset of private health organizations, some called social enterprises, have developed novel approaches to increase the availability, affordability and quality of health care services to the poor through innovative health service delivery models. This study aims to characterize these models and identify areas of innovation that have led to effective provision of care for the poor.
   Methods: An environmental scan of peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted to select exemplars of innovation. A case series of organizations was then purposively sampled to maximize variation. These cases were examined using content analysis and constant comparison to characterize their strategies, focusing on business processes.
   Results: After an initial sample of 46 studies, 10 case studies of exemplars were developed spanning different geography, disease areas and health service delivery models. These ten organizations had innovations in their marketing, financing, and operating strategies. These included approaches such a social marketing, cross-subsidy, high-volume, low cost models, and process reengineering. They tended to have a narrow clinical focus, which facilitates standardizing processes of care, and experimentation with novel delivery models. Despite being well-known, information on the social impact of these organizations was variable, with more data on availability and affordability and less on quality of care.
   Conclusions: These private sector organizations demonstrate a range of innovations in health service delivery that have the potential to better serve the poor's health needs and be replicated. There is a growing interest in investing in social enterprises, like the ones profiled here. However, more rigorous evaluations are needed to investigate the impact and quality of the health services provided and determine the effectiveness of particular strategies.

AB Background. Decision making at the end of life is frequently complex and often filled with uncertainty. We hypothesized that people with limited health literacy would have more uncertainty about end-of-life decision making than people with adequate literacy. We also hypothesized that video images would decrease uncertainty. Design. Before and after oral survey. Participants. Subjects presenting to their primary care physicians. Methods. Subjects were asked about their preferences for end-of-life care after they heard a verbal description of advanced dementia and were asked to rate the level of their uncertainty. Subjects then viewed a video of a patient with advanced dementia and were asked again about their preferences and uncertainty. Uncertainty was measured using the Decisional Conflict Scale with score ranges from 3 (high uncertainty) to 15 (no uncertainty). Health literacy was measured using the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine, and subjects were divided into 3 literacy categories: low (0-45, 6th grade and below), marginal (46-60, 7th- 8th grade), and adequate (61-66, 9th grade and above). Results. A total of 146 patients completed the interview. Prior to the video, the average uncertainty scores for subjects with low, marginal, and adequate health literacy were 10.8, 12.4, and 13.5, respectively (P < 0.0001). After the video, the 3 groups had similar uncertainty about their decisions. The average uncertainty scores for subjects with low, marginal, and adequate health literacy were 13.6, 14.1, and 14.5, respectively (P = 0.046). Conclusions. Subjects with limited health literacy expressed more uncertainty about their preferences for end-of-life care than did subjects with adequate literacy. Our video decision aid improved end-of-life decision making by decreasing uncertainty regarding subjects' preferences, especially for those with limited literacy.

AB Background Despite the high risk of developing a mental disorder during adolescence, many young people fail to receive appropriate treatment from mental health professionals. Recent studies have found certain mental health information websites have improved mental health literacy and reduced symptoms of depression. However, studies exploring young people's perceptions of such resources still remain scarce. The current paper compared young people's preference for a website with self-help books and two face-to-face services-counselling and mental health services. The factors associated with believing in the perceived helpfulness of each intervention were also explored. Method A national telephone survey was carried out with 3,746 people aged 12-25 years and 2005 co-resident parents. Perceived helpfulness of each intervention was assessed in relation to four vignettes (depression, social phobia, psychosis and depression with alcohol misuse). Results Approximately 71% of respondents rated websites and books as likely to be helpful, which was less than for counselling, but more than for mental health services. Predictors of rating a website as likely to be helpful were older age (18-25 years), belief in seeking help, less social distance from peers like the one in the vignette, and being presented with the vignettes depicting either social phobia or depression with alcohol misuse. Predictors of rating a book as helpful included belief in seeking help, awareness of the national depression initiative beyondblue, less social distance, being presented with the social phobia vignette, and the belief that the person in the vignette is 'weak not sick'. Conclusion Most young people are open to the idea of accessing mental health information online, especially for disorders that are often perceived as behavioural problems. These young people also believe in help-seeking in general and are more willing to associate with peers who have mental health problems.

AB Background: Community surveys have found that some people believe that it is better to deal with depression alone rather than seek help. However, there has been little research into the characteristics of this group.
   Methods: Data were drawn from three Australian surveys: (1) a national survey of 1001 adults aged 18+ years; (2) a school survey of 552 students aged 14-16 years from two regions; (3) a survey of 577 young people aged 12-17 years from the Melbourne region. In all three surveys, participants who believed it would be helpful to deal with depression alone were contrasted with those who believed it would be harmful in terms of sociodemographic characteristics, recognition of depression in a vignette, contact with people who experienced depression, beliefs about treatments, beliefs about using substances, beliefs about long-term outcomes, and beliefs about causes.
   Results: In both adolescents and adults, belief in dealing with depression alone was associated with male gender, less favourable views about mental health professionals, more favourable views about using substances to deal with depression, and a more positive expectation about the outcome if treatment is not sought. Adolescents believing in dealing with depression alone had more favourable views about some potential helpers, such as church workers and pharmacists. In adults, but not adolescents, there was an association with the belief that depression is caused by personal weakness. Limitations: The surveys did not directly ask about reasons for believing that dealing with depression alone would be helpful and did not assess actual help-seeking.
   Conclusions: Factors encouraging dealing with depression alone are a belief that it is a self-limiting disorder, that substances are an effective way to deal with it and, in adults, that depression is due to personal weakness. Consistent with previous research, males are an important target group for encouraging seeking help to deal with depression. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID INFORMATION
AB There is an "infodemic" associated with the COVID-19 pandemic-an overabundance of valid and invalid information. Health literacy is the ability to access, understand, appraise, and apply health information, making it crucial for navigating coronavirus and COVID-19 information environments. A cross-sectional representative study of participants >= 16 years in Germany was conducted using an online survey. A coronavirus-related health literacy measure was developed (HLS-COVID-Q22). Internal consistency was very high (alpha = 0.940; rho = 0.891) and construct validity suggests a sufficient model fit, making HLS-COVID-Q22 a feasible tool for assessing coronavirus-related health literacy in population surveys. While 49.9% of our sample had sufficient levels of coronavirus-related health literacy, 50.1% had "problematic" (15.2%) or "inadequate" (34.9%) levels. Although the overall level of health literacy is high, a vast number of participants report difficulties dealing with coronavirus and COVID-19 information. The participants felt well informed about coronavirus, but 47.8% reported having difficulties judging whether they could trust media information on COVID-19. Confusion about coronavirus information was significantly higher among those who had lower health literacy. This calls for targeted public information campaigns and promotion of population-based health literacy for better navigation of information environments during the infodemic, identification of disinformation, and decision-making based on reliable and trustworthy information.

AB Stigma in men's depression and suicide can restrict help-seeking, reduce treatment compliance and deter individuals from confiding in friends and family. In this article we report sex comparison findings from a national survey of English-speaking adult Canadians about stigmatized beliefs concerning male depression and suicide. Among respondents without direct experience of depression or suicide (n = 541) more than a third endorsed the view that men with depression are unpredictable. Overall, a greater proportion of males endorsed stigmatizing views about male depression compared to female respondents. A greater proportion of female respondents endorsed items indicating that men who suicide are disconnected, lost and lonely. Male and female respondents with direct personal experience of depression or suicide (n = 360) strongly endorsed stigmatizing attitudes toward themselves and a greater proportion of male respondents indicated that they would be embarrassed about seeking help for depression.

TI Health Literacy Predicts Morbidity and Mortality in Rural Patients With
   Heart Failure
SO JOURNAL OF CARDIAC FAILURE

DT Article

ID SELF-CARE; HOSPITAL READMISSION; DEPRESSION; KNOWLEDGE; INTERVENTION;
   ADHERENCE; DEATH; RATES; RISK; REHOSPITALIZATION
AB Background: Patients hospitalized with heart failure are often readmitted. Health literacy may play a substantial role in the high rate of readmissions. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of health literacy with the composite end point of heart failure readmission rates and all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure living in rural areas.
   Methods and Results: Rural adults (n = 575), hospitalized for heart failure within the past 6 months, completed the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (STOMA) to measure health literacy and were followed for >= 2 years. The percentage of patients with the end point of heart failure readmission or all-cause death was different (P = .001) among the 3 STOFHLA score levels. Unadjusted analysis revealed that patients with inadequate and marginal health literacy were 1.94 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.43-2.63; P < .001) times, and 1.91 (95% CI 1.36-2.67; P < .001) times, respectively, more likely to experience the outcome. After adjustment for covariates, health literacy remained a predictor of outcomes. Of the other covariates, worse functional class, higher comorbidity burden, and higher depression score predicted worse outcomes.
   Conclusions: Inadequate or marginal health literacy is a risk factor for heart failure rehospitalization or all-cause mortality among rural patients with heart failure.

   KNOWLEDGE; NUMERACY; SPANISH; ADULTS
AB The concept of health literacy initially emerged and continues to gain strength as an approach to improving health status and the performance of health systems. Numerous studies clearly link low levels of education, literacy, and health literacy with poor health, poor health care utilization, increased barriers to care, and early death. However, theoretical understandings and methods of measuring the complex social construct of health literacy have experienced a continual evolution that remains incomplete. As a result, the seemingly most-cited definition of health literacy proposed in the now-decade-old Institute of Medicine report on health literacy is long overdue for updating. Such an effort should engage a broad and diverse set of health literacy researchers, practitioners, and members of the public in creating a definition that can earn broad consensus through validation testing in a rigorous scientific approach. That effort also could produce the basis for a new universally applicable measure of health literacy. Funders, health systems, and policymakers should reconsider their timid approach to health literacy. Although the field and corresponding evidence base are not perfect, health literacy-especially when combined with a focus on prevention and integrative health-is one of the most promising approaches to advancing public health.

AB Purpose: Young immigrants without documentation who qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program are eligible for temporary legal status but excluded from the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion and Health Care Exchanges. Little is known about this population's health or access to care.
   Methods: Sixty-one DACA-eligible Latinos aged 18-31 years were recruited from community and Internet settings to participate in nine focus groups in California. An advisory board of immigration and health advocates assisted in the project's design and validation of results.
   Results: Participants reported avoiding the health care system whenever possible, first turning to family members and unlicensed community healers, then seeking safety net providers if necessary. Barriers to care included cost, limited intergenerational knowledge about the health care system, lack of a driver's license, and mistrust of providers due to fear of discrimination and deportation. Mental health care was the greatest unmet health need. They wanted more information about their health care options and access to primary care, dental, and vision benefits. Participants reported refraining from high-risk behaviors to avoid associated financial and legal burdens that might threaten their immigration status.
   Conclusions: As the first study to describe DACA-eligible young adults' health needs, these data demonstrate their profound mental health challenges and numerous barriers to health care access. Many barriers were attributed to their undocumented status and persisted even when they gained temporary legal status. This work provides a foundation for evidence-based policy changes to address the health needs of this and other undocumented populations. (C) 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

AB Background: In rapidly developing Internet-user societies, eHealth literacy has become important in promoting wellness. Although previous studies have observed that poor health literacy is associated with less knowledge and screening practice of colorectal cancer (CRC), little is known about whether eHealth literacy is associated with these variables.
   Objective: The present study examined associations between eHealth literacy, knowledge of CRC, and CRC screening practices.
   Methods: Data were analyzed for 2970 Japanese adults (men, 49.9%; mean age +/- SD, 39.7 +/- 10.9 years) who responded to an Internet-based cross-sectional survey. Knowledge of the definition of CRC, its risk factors and screening practice, previous experience of CRC screening, score on the Japanese version of the eHEALS (J-eHEALS), sociodemographic attributes (sex, age, marital status, educational attainment, and household income level), and frequency of Internet usage were obtained. Sociodemographic attributes and frequency of Internet usage were used as control variables in the multiple regression and logistic regression models.
   Results: eHealth literacy was positively associated with CRC knowledge (beta = .116, < .001), when the covariables of both eHealth literacy and CRC knowledge were used in the multiple regression model. Moreover, after controlling for sociodemographic factors, which were significantly associated with eHealth literacy and CRC screening practice, an increase of 1 point in the eHEALS score signified that participants were 1.03 times (95% CI = 1.01-1.05) more likely to undergo CRC screening.
   Conclusions: Internet users with high eHealth literacy are more likely to have knowledge and previous screening practice related to CRC compared to those with low eHealth literacy. (J Med Internet Res 2012;14(6):e153) doi:10.2196/jmir.1927

AB BACKGROUND: Optimizing postdischarge medication adherence is a target for avoiding adverse events. Nevertheless, few studies have focused on predictors of postdischarge medication adherence. METHODS: The Pharmacist Intervention for Low Literacy in Cardiovascular Disease (PILL-CVD) study used counseling and follow-up to improve postdischarge medication safety. In this secondary data analysis, we analyzed predictors of self-reported medication adherence after discharge. Based on an interview at 30-days postdischarge, an adherence score was calculated as the mean adherence in the previous week of all regularly scheduled medications. Multivariable linear regression was used to determine the independent predictors of postdischarge adherence. RESULTS: The mean age of the 646 included patients was 61.2 years, and they were prescribed an average of 8 daily medications. The mean postdischarge adherence score was 95% (standard deviation [SD] = 10.2%). For every 10-year increase in age, there was a 1% absolute increase in postdischarge adherence (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.4% to 2.0%). Compared to patients with private insurance, patients with Medicaid were 4.5% less adherent (95% CI -7.6% to -1.4%). For every 1-point increase in baseline medication adherence score, as measured by the 4-item Morisky score, there was a 1.6% absolute increase in postdischarge medication adherence (95% CI 0.8% to 2.4%). Surprisingly, health literacy was not an independent predictor of postdischarge adherence. CONCLUSIONS: In patients hospitalized for cardiovascular disease, predictors of lower medication adherence postdischarge included younger age, Medicaid insurance, and baseline nonadherence. These factors can help predict patients who may benefit from further interventions. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2012;. (C) 2012 Society of Hospital Medicine

AB This article examines the health information literacy of elderly Finns. The results are based on a survey conducted in January 2011. The questionnaire was distributed to 1000 persons that were randomly drawn from the Finnish Population Register. The respondents were aged 65-79 years (mean age 70 years) and lived in the Turku region in Finland. A total of 281 questionnaires (28%) were returned. chi(2) analyses were used to find possible relationships between demographic factors, as well as interest, seeking activity, current self-rated health and different dimensions of health information literacy, including needs, seeking and use of health-related information. Significant relationships were found between education level, interest in health information, seeking activity, self-rated current health and dimensions of health information literacy. Some categories of elderly people are more vulnerable regarding obtaining and use of health information: those with lower levels of education, those with poor health, and those who are not interested in and active at seeking information. For people who are found in any of these categories, it is important that available health-related information is understandable and can be accessed without too much effort-something that information providers should take into account.

TI The Health Literacy Skills Instrument: A 10-Item Short Form
SO JOURNAL OF HEALTH COMMUNICATION
LA English
DT Article
ID PRIMARY-CARE
AB The 25-item Health Literacy Skills Instrument (HLSI) was designed to measure the ability to read and understand text and locate and interpret information in documents (print literacy), to use quantitative information (numeracy), to listen effectively (oral literacy), and to seek information through the Internet (navigation). It is a publically available measure that can be used in surveillance activities, to evaluate interventions, and in research examining the relation between health literacy and health outcomes. The authors developed a 10-item, short form (SF) version of the HLSI, the HLSI-SF, using data gathered for the development of the longer form. The authors selected 10 items for inclusion in the HLSI-SF and conducted a confirmatory factor analysis and item response theory analyses, then computed Cronbach's alpha. The HLSI-SF demonstrated acceptable internal consistency reliability (alpha = .70) for use in group-level comparisons. The HSLI-SF has many of the same advantages of the longer version with the additional benefit of taking only approximately 5 to 10 min to administer. The HLSI-SF offers researchers and practitioners a valid and reliable measure of health literacy skills.

AB Objective: Cancer patients receiving adjuvant therapy encounter increasingly complex situations and decisions with each new procedure and therapy. To make informed decisions about care, they need to be able to access, process, and understand information. Individuals with limited health literacy may not be able to obtain or understand important information about their cancer and treatment. The rate of low health literacy has been shown to be higher among African Americans than among non-Hispanic Whites. This study examined the associations between race, health literacy, and self-reported needs for information about disease, diagnostic tests, treatments, physical care, and psychosocial resources.
   Methods: Measures assessing information needs were administered to 138 newly diagnosed cancer patients. Demographics were assessed by survey and health literacy was assessed with two commonly used measures: the Rapid Estimate Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) and the Short Test of Health Literacy in Adults (STOFHLA).
   Results: Study findings indicate that educational attainment, rather than health literacy, is a significant predictor of information needs.
   Conclusion: Overcoming barriers to information needs may be less dependent on literacy considerations and more dependent on issues that divide across levels of educational attainment.
   Practice implications: Oncologists and hospital staff should be attentive to the fact that many patients require additional assistance to meet their information needs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVE: Medication dosing errors by parents are frequent. We sought to whether a pictographic dosing diagram could improve parent ability to dose infant acetaminophen, and to determine whether pictogram benefit varies by health literacy level.
   METHODS: We conducted an experimental study of parents presenting with their children to an urban public hospital pediatric clinic. Caregivers were randomized to dose infant acetaminophen with a standard dropper using text-only or text-plus-pictogram instructions (pictographic diagram of dose). The primary outcome variable was dosing accuracy (error defined as >20% deviation above/below dose; large overdosing error defined as >1.5 times recommended dose). Caregiver health literacy was assessed by means of the Newest Vital Sign measure.
   RESULTS: A total of 299 parents were assessed (144 text-only instructions; 155 text plus pictogram); 77.9% had limited health literacy (Newest Vital Sign score 0-3). Text-plus-pictogram recipients were less likely to make an error compared to text-only recipients (43.9% vs 59.0%, P = .01; absolute risk reduction, 15.2% [95% confidence interval, 3.8-26.0]; number needed to treat, 7 [4-26]). Of text-plus-pictogram recipients, 0.6% made a large overdosing error compared to 5.6% of text-only recipients (absolute risk reduction, 4.9% [0.9-10.0]; number needed to treat, 20 [10-108]). Pictogram benefit varied by health literacy, with a statistically significant difference in dosing error evident in the text-plus-pictogram group compared to the text-only group among parents with low health literacy (50.4% vs 66.4%; P = .02), but not for parents with adequate health literacy (P = .7).
   CONCLUSIONS: Inclusion of pictographic dosing diagrams as part of written medication instructions for infant acetaminophen may help parents provide doses of medication more accurately, especially those with low health literacy. High error rates, even among parents with adequate health literacy, suggest that additional study of strategies to optimize dosing is needed.

TI The Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW), a novel infrastructure for
   population health research: rationale and methods
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Evidence-based public health requires the existence of reliable information systems for priority setting and evaluation of interventions. Existing data systems in the United States are either too crude (e. g., vital statistics), rely on administrative data (e. g., Medicare) or, because of their national scope (e. g., NHANES), lack the discriminatory power to assess specific needs and to evaluate community health activities at the state and local level. This manuscript describes the rationale and methods of the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW), a novel infrastructure for population health research.
   Methods/Design: The program consists of a series of independent annual surveys gathering health-related data on representative samples of state residents and communities. Two-stage cluster sampling is used to select households and recruit approximately 800-1,000 adult participants (21-74 years old) each year. Recruitment and initial interviews are done at the household; additional interviews and physical exams are conducted at permanent or mobile examination centers. Individual survey data include physical, mental, and oral health history, health literacy, demographics, behavioral, lifestyle, occupational, and household characteristics as well as health care access and utilization. The physical exam includes blood pressure, anthropometry, bioimpedance, spirometry, urine collection and blood draws. Serum, plasma, and buffy coats (for DNA extraction) are stored in a biorepository for future studies. Every household is geocoded for linkage with existing contextual data including community level measures of the social and physical environment; local neighborhood characteristics are also recorded using an audit tool. Participants are re-contacted bi-annually by phone for health history updates.
   Discussion: SHOW generates data to assess health disparities across state communities as well as trends on prevalence of health outcomes and determinants. SHOW also serves as a platform for ancillary epidemiologic studies and for studies to evaluate the effect of community-specific interventions. It addresses key gaps in our current data resources and increases capacity for etiologic, applied and translational population health research. It is hoped that this program will serve as a model to better support evidence-based public health, facilitate intervention evaluation research, and ultimately help improve health throughout the state and nation.

AB Background: Information on patient experience and satisfaction with individual physicians could play an important role for performance measures, improved health care and health literacy. Physician rating sites (PRSs) bear the potential to be a widely available source for this kind of information. However, patient experience and satisfaction are complex constructs operationalized by multiple dimensions. The way in which PRSs allow users to express and rate patient experience and satisfaction could likely influence the image of doctors in society and the self-understanding of both doctors and patients. This study examines the extent to which PRSs currently represent the constructs of patient experience and satisfaction.
   Methods: First, a systematic review of research instruments for measuring patient experience and satisfaction was conducted. The content of these instruments was analyzed qualitatively to create a comprehensive set of dimensions for patient experience and patient satisfaction. Second, PRSs were searched for systematically in English-language and German-language search engines of Google and Yahoo. Finally, we classified every structured question asked by the different PRS using the set of dimensions of patient experience and satisfaction.
   Results: The qualitative content analysis of the measurement instruments produced 13 dimensions of patient experience and satisfaction. We identified a total of 21 PRSs. No PRSs represented all 13 dimensions of patient satisfaction and experience with its structured questions. The 3 most trafficked English-language PRS represent between 5 and 6 dimensions and the 3 most trafficked German language PRSs between 8 and 11 dimensions The dimensions for patient experience and satisfaction most frequently represented in PRSs included diversely operationalized ones such as professional competence and doctor-patient relationship/support. However, other less complex but nevertheless important dimensions such as communication skills and information/advice were rarely represented, especially in English-language PRSs.
   Conclusions: Concerning the potential impact of PRSs on health systems, further research is needed to show which of the current operationalizations of patient experience and satisfaction presented in our study are establishing themselves in PRSs. Independently of this factual development, the question also arises whether and to what extent health policy can and should influence the operationalization of patient experience and satisfaction in PRSs. Here, the challenge would be to produce a set of dimensions capable of consensus from among the wide range of operationalizations found by this study.

AB Diabetes, with its consequences of premature death, complications, and economic costs, is a precursor to a public health crisis that is expected to worsen over the next several decades. The improvement of diabetes outcomes, specifically glycemic control as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin concentration (HbA1c), can impact this critical situation. A quantitative study was conducted that examined health literacy and patient trust as predictors of glycemic control. The related factors of demographics, socioeconomic status, diabetes knowledge, self-care activities, and depression were also considered. Implementing a cross-sectional, predictive design, a convenience sample of 102 patients with diabetes was recruited from two urban primary care clinics in the USA. A simultaneous multiple regression was conducted. The regression analysis was significant, with patient trust and depression accounting for 28.5% of the variance in HbA1c. There was a significant positive relationship between socioeconomic status and health literacy and between diabetes knowledge and health literacy. The results support promotion of the patient-provider relationship, depression screening among individuals with diabetes, and exploration of new strategies for diabetes education. Future research is needed to advance the framework, ascertain which factors engender patient trust, and determine the role of health literacy in glycemic control.

AB Study Design. Analysis of spine-related websites available to the general public.
   Objective. To assess the readability of spine-related patient educational materials available on professional society and individual surgeon or practice based websites.
   Summary of Background Data. The Internet has become a valuable source of patient education material. A significant percentage of patients, however, find this Internet based information confusing. Healthcare experts recommend that the readability of patient education material be less than the sixth grade level. The Flesch-Kincaid grade level is the most widely used method to evaluate the readability score of textual material, with lower scores suggesting easier readability.
   Methods. We conducted an Internet search of all patient education documents on the North American Spine Society (NASS), American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS), the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), and a sample of 10 individual surgeon or practice based websites. The Flesch-Kincaid grade level of each article was calculated using widely available Microsoft Office Word software. The mean grade level of articles on the various professional society and individual/practice based websites were compared.
   Results. A total of 121 articles from the various websites were available and analyzed. All 4 categories of websites had mean Flesch-Kincaid grade levels greater than 10. Only 3 articles (2.5%) were found to be at or below the sixth grade level, the recommended readability level for adult patients in the United States. There were no significant differences among the mean Flesch-Kincaid grade levels from the AAOS, NASS, AANS, and practice-based web-sites (P = 0.065, ANOVA).
   Conclusion. Our findings suggest that most of the Spine-related patient education materials on professional society and practice-based websites have readability scores that may be too high, making comprehension difficult for a substantial portion of the United States adult population.

AB More than 1 in 3 adults in the United States have low health literacy, which can adversely affect the quality and cost of health care. These individuals are less likely than those who are health literate to be knowledgeable about their chronic diseases and possess adequate self-management skills, and are more likely to make medication errors. Demographic risk factors alone cannot identify such patients. Health care providers should use a rapid screening test to identify patients with low health literacy, tailor literacy-related interventions to the communication needs of the individual patient, and assess patient recall and comprehension. Effective strategies to improve patient comprehension include conveying a few key points at each patient visit, jargon-free Communication, use of pictures to clarify concepts, and confirmation of patient comprehension via the "show-me" or "teach-back" method. Despite these advances, collaboration between multiple stakeholders in the health care system is necessary to overcome barriers to health literacy and enhance quality of care.

AB Aims and objectives.
   The aim of the study was to investigate the relationships of health literacy to chronic medical conditions and the functional health status among community-dwelling Korean older adults.
   Background.
   In the literature, limited health literacy has been reported to have adverse effect on health outcomes. However, the link between health literacy to health status among Korean older adults needs to be clarified.
   Design.
   A cross-sectional survey.
   Methods.
   A cross-sectional survey of 103 community-dwelling Korean older adults was conducted from June 2007-September 2007. Health literacy was measured using the Korean Functional Health Literacy test and functional health status was measured using the subscales of the Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short-Form Health Survey.
   Results.
   Individuals with a low health literacy had significantly higher rates of arthritis and hypertension. After adjusting for age, education and income, older individuals with low health literacy had higher limitations in activity and lower subjective health. In a model adjusting for age and income only, older individuals with low health literacy were more likely to report lower levels of physical function and subjective health and higher levels of limitations in activity and pain.
   Conclusions.
   Among community-dwelling Korean older adults, limited health literacy is associated independently with higher rates of chronic medical conditions and lower subjective health status.
   Relevance to clinical practice.
   Nurses are key to providing health education to older adults. The understanding of the relationship of health literacy to health status is essential to develop communication and health education efforts for older adults in nursing practice.

AB Background: This study was designed to assess differences in diabetes knowledge, diabetes self-management, and perceived control among depressed and nondepressed individuals in an indigent population with type 2 diabetes.
   Research Design and Methods: Depressed and nondepressed patients with the clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes were recruited from an indigent care clinic. Subjects completed validated surveys to assess diabetes knowledge, diabetes self-management, and perceived control of diabetes. We compared demographic characteristics and diabetes knowledge, diabetes self-management, and perceived control of diabetes by depression status. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 14.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).
   Results: Of the 201 subjects with diagnosed type 2 diabetes enrolled in the study, approximately 20% (n = 40) of the sample was depressed. Subjects with depression were more likely to report self-care control problems (mean = 2.2 +/- 1.0 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.6, P < 0.001) and less likely to report positive attitude (mean = 2.9 +/- 0.7 vs. 3.7 +/- 0.5, P < 0.001), self-care ability (mean = 3.2 +/- 3.6 vs. 3.7 +/- 0.5, P < 0.001), and self-care adherence (mean = 3.3 +/- 0.9 vs. 4.1 +/- 0.6, P < 0.001). Depressed patients were less likely to report perceived control of diabetes (mean = 47.7 +/- 8.5 vs. 57.8 +/- 7.4, P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in diabetes knowledge, self-care understanding, and Perceived importance of self-care between depressed and nondepressed patients.
   Conclusions: In this indigent population with type 2 diabetes, diabetes knowledge did not differ significantly by depression status, but diabetes self-management practices and perceived control of diabetes differed significantly by depression status. Patients who were depressed had poorer diabetes self-care and felt they had less control over their disease.

AB Objective: This article provides an analysis of issues and empirical evidence related to literacy, cultural, and linguistic factors in online health and cancer communication, and recommendations to improve cancer communication for diverse audiences.
   Methods: We examined English-language online literature and selected books and policy documents related to literacy, cultural, and linguistic factors in health and cancer communication.
   Results: Studies about literacy, cultural, and linguistic factors in online cancer communication for diverse audiences are limited, but have increased during the past 15 years. Empirical evidence and theoretical guidance describe the critical importance of these factors, significant unmet needs among low-literate, multicultural and non-English-speaking populations, and strategies to improve communication.
   Conclusion: Overall, online cancer communication has not met the literacy, cultural, and linguistic needs of diverse populations. The literature offers valuable recommendations about enhancing research, practice, and policy for better cancer communication.
   Practice implications: Practitioners should understand the strengths and weaknesses of online cancer communication for vulnerable groups, guide patients to better Websites, and supplement that information with oral and tailored communication. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aim. To investigate general surgical patients' perspectives of the adequacy and appropriateness of their discharge planning.
   Objectives. To identify any aspects of discharge planning that could be strengthened to assist people in managing their posthospital care and maintaining continuity of care.
   Background. Appropriate discharge planning is a priority in today's healthcare environment in which patients are discharged 'quicker and sicker', sometimes without home support. Adequate and appropriate discharge planning helps promote health literacy, which has benefits for both patients and their caregivers in helping them manage postsurgical recovery at home.
   Design. A qualitative, interpretive study was designed in which patients were interviewed at least one week after they returned home from hospital.
   Methods. Purposeful sampling was used to interview 13 general surgical patients from one of three hospitals (two public and one private) in New South Wales and Queensland, Australia. Data were collected in unstructured interviews and analysed using thematic analysis. Reflective analysis by individual research team members generated preliminary themes, which were then analysed collectively by all members of the research team to achieve consensus on patients' perspectives.
   Results. Themes included a 'one-size-fits-all' approach to providing discharge information; inconsistent or variable advice from different health professionals; a lack of predischarge assessment of their home and/or work conditions and the need for follow-up assessment of patient and carer needs.
   Conclusions. The findings of this study illuminate the need for a more individualized approach to discharge planning, taking into account the patient's age, gender, surgical procedure and family and community support for immediate and longer-term nursing follow-up.
   Relevance to clincial practice. Patients would be more adequately prepared for their recovery period at home, by encouraging client-centred, interdisciplinary communication between health practitioners; adopting a flexible, approach to discharge planning which is tailored to individual needs of postsurgical patients, particularly in relation to advice and information related to recovery; and encouraging and supporting adequate health literacy for self-management.

AB OBJECTIVE - To determine whether the use of nondiabetes-related preventive services (mammography, colorectal cancer screening, and bone density testing) among elderly diabetic women is different from the use among nondiabetic women.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Using a representative sample of the U S elderly female population and the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER), Medicare files, we identified women with or without diabetes who were >= 67 years of age on 1 January 1999. All women with a prior history of cancer were excluded. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to compare the rates of preventive service use and to understand the factors influencing their use in the next 2-4 years.
   RESULTS - women with diabetes were less likely to have a mammogram (odds ratio [OR] 0.83 [95% CI 0.78-0.881), colorectal cancer screening (0.79 [0.70-0.88]), and bone density testing (0.63 [0.58-0.691). Women with diabetes seen by endocrinologists had significant higher rates of bone density testing than women seen by primary care physicians. Women see by obstetrician/gynecologists had the highest rates of use of all three services.
   CONCLUSIONS - Elderly women with diabetes are less likely to receive cancer and osteoporosis screening than women without diabetes. Physicians treating these patients need to assure that they receive all recommended preventive services appropriate for their age. Additional national guidelines, practice-based improvements, and patient education targeting those at greatest risk of not receiving these services may be needed to achieve parity.

AB Objective. To determine the health literacy of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) attending community-based rheumatology practice.
   Methods. Eighty patients were administered the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (TOFH-LA), a 50-item reading comprehension and 17-item numerical ability test (score 0-100); the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM), which asks participants to read aloud 66 words of varying difficulty (score 0-66); and the Test of Reading Comprehension (TORCH), which asks participants to read a short text and then fill in the gaps of another version by using one or more of their own words (score 1-9).
   Results. The study group included 60 women (75%), mean age (SD) 60.29 (15.02) years, median duration of RA 8 years (range 0.3-39). Nineteen of 80 (24%) had completed <= 8 years of formal education, 24/80 (30%) had completed 9 or 10 years, and 37/80 (46%) had completed >= 11 years. TOFHLA and REALM scores ranged from 39-100 and 41-66 respectively. Scores for 8 patients (10%) indicated they would have difficult reading and interpreting health texts and struggle with most currently available patient education materials. Of those who attempted the TORCH, 8/65 (12%) scored low or below average and 23/65 (35%) scored average compared with students completing 9th grade. All 3 literacy tests were significantly correlated with education level, but use of educational level alone its it measure of literacy would have misclassified more than 10% as health literate/illiterate.
   Conclusion. A significant number of patients with RA have limited health literacy and may not understand even simple written instructions or prescription labels.

AB CONTEXT. Many women undergoing cervical cancer screening lack appropriate understanding of the Pop test. It is important to evaluate knowledge and informational needs about Pop testing among groups who may have difficulty accessing core or a relatively low likelihood of obtaining follow-up for an abnormal result, such as minority and low-income women.
   METHODS: A sample of 338 women undergoing cervical screening at two clinics in Texas completed a questionnaire measuring their knowledge of Pop testing and asking what specific information they would like to know about the test. Group comparisons and qualitative analyses were conducted.
   RESULTS: Women correctly answered an average of 8.7 out of 20 questions, the range was 0-17. Mean scores were higher among white women (10.2) than among blacks (8.4) and Hispanics (7.4), among women with more than a high school education than among their less educated counterparts (10.0 vs. 7.9) and among women with an annual household income of at least $10,000 than among those with a lower income (9.3 vs. 8.4). Knowledge scores did not differ according to Pap history. Open-ended questioning identified a need for information on the purpose of the test, exam procedures, abnormal test results and prognosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Minority women and those of low socioeconomic status had poor understanding of Pap testing. Identifying misunderstandings in this vulnerable population and improving patient education on the most basic aspects of Pap testing may increase adherence to follow-up when abnormalities ore detected.

AB Background Few studies have examined attitudes towards eating-disordered behaviour among women in the general population. Methods A vignette describing a fictional person meeting diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa (BN) was presented to a community sample of women aged 18-45. Respondents (n = 208) were asked a series of questions concerning the severity and prevalence of the problem described. Results Most respondents viewed BN as a distressing condition whose sufferers are deserving of sympathy. However, more than one-third of respondents had at some stage believed that it 'might not be too bad' to be like the person described in the vignette. Most respondents believed that the prevalence of the problem described among women in the community was likely to be between 10% and 30% (48.6%) or between 30% and 50% (23.1%). Individuals with a clinically significant eating disorder (n = 13, 6.3%) were more likely to perceive the symptoms of BN as being acceptable, and its prevalence higher, than individuals with no eating disorder diagnosis. Conclusions Information concerning the medical and psychological sequelae of BN and other eating disorders might usefully be incorporated in prevention programmes. Prospective community-based research is required to elucidate the nature of the relationship between perceived acceptability of eating disorder symptoms and actual eating disorder psychopathology. Extension of the present research to examine the views of women in other cultures would also be of interest.

TI Mental health literacy of those with major depression and suicidal
   ideation: An impediment to help seeking
SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English

   MANAGEMENT; RISK; COMMUNITY; KNOWLEDGE; LIFETIME
AB Mental health literacy is the knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders that aid their recognition, management, or prevention, and is an important determinant of help seeking. This has relevance in suicide prevention, particularly for those with major depression, the clinical condition most frequently associated-with suicidal behavior. In this study of a random and representative community sample, a vignette depicting classical features of major depression was presented to subjects along with questions related to mental health literacy. The responses of those with major depression, as delineated by the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders instrument, both with and without suicidal ideation, were compared to those of a third group of respondents. The results demonstrated that despite increased professional contact by those with major depression and suicidal ideation, there were few differences among the three groups on either open-ended or direct questions related to mental health literacy. This indicates that increased professional contact in itself was not related to increased mental health literacy, and suggests that more specific psychoeducational programs are required.

AB Purpose Rural residents may have lower access to and use of certain health information sources relative to urban residents. We investigated differences in information source access and use between rural and urban US adults and whether having low health literacy might exacerbate rural disparities in access to and use of health information. Methods Six hundred participants (50% rural) completed an online survey about access and use of 25 health information sources. We used logistic regression models to test associations between rurality and access to and use of health information sources and whether rurality interacted with health literacy to predict the access and use. Findings Compared to urban residents, rural residents had lower access to health information from sources including primary care providers, specialist doctors, blogs, and magazines, and less use of search engines. After accounting for sociodemographics, rural residents only had lower access to specialist doctors than urban residents. Rural residents with limited health literacy had lower access to mass media and scientific literature but higher use of corporations/companies than rural residents with adequate health literacy and urban residents regardless of health literacy level. Conclusions Some differences in access to and use of health information sources may be accounted for by sociodemographic differences between rural and urban populations. There may be structural barriers such as shortage of specialist doctors and limited media exposure that make it harder for rural residents to access health information, especially those with limited health literacy.

AB Adolescent and young adult men do poorly on indicators of mental health evidenced by elevated rates of suicide, conduct disorder, substance use, and interpersonal violence relative to their female peers. Data on global health burden clearly demonstrate that young men have a markedly distinct health risk profile from young women, underscoring different prevention and intervention needs. Evidence indicates that boys disconnect from health-care services during adolescence, marking the beginning of a progression of health-care disengagement and associated barriers to care, including presenting to services differently, experiencing an inadequate or poorly attuned clinical response, and needing to overcome pervasive societal attitudes and self-stigma to access available services. This review synthesizes key themes related to mental ill health in adolescent boys and in young adult men. Key social determinants are discussed, including mental health literacy, self-stigma and shame, masculinity, nosology and diagnosis, and service acceptability. A call is made for focused development of policy, theory, and evaluation of targeted interventions for this population, including gender-synchronized service model reform and training of staff, including the e-health domain. Such progress is expected to yield significant social and economic benefits, including reduction to mental ill health and interpersonal violence displayed by adolescent boys and young adult men.

AB Inadequate health literacy (HL) is associated with impaired healthcare choices leading to poor quality-of-care. Our primary purpose was to estimate the prevalence of inadequate HL among two populations of AARP (R) Medicare Supplement insureds: sicker and healthier populations; to identify characteristics of inadequate HL; and to describe the impact on patient satisfaction, preventive services, healthcare utilization, and expenditures. Surveys were mailed to insureds in 10 states. Multivariate regression models were used to identify characteristics and adjust outcomes. Among respondents (N = 7334), 23% and 16% of sicker and healthier insureds, respectively, indicated inadequate HL. Characteristics of inadequate HL included male gender, older age, more comorbidities, and lower education. Inadequate HL was associated with lower patient satisfaction, lower preventive service compliance, higher healthcare utilization and expenditures. Inadequate HL is more common among older adults in poorer health, further compromising their health outcomes; thus they may benefit from expanded educational or additional care coordination interventions.

AB Background: Many adolescents have poor mental health literacy, stigmatising attitudes towards people with mental illness, and lack skills in providing optimal Mental Health First Aid to peers. These could be improved with training to facilitate better social support and increase appropriate help-seeking among adolescents with emerging mental health problems. teen Mental Health First Aid (teen MHFA), a new initiative of Mental Health First Aid International, is a 3 x 75 min classroom based training program for students aged 15-18 years.
   Methods: An uncontrolled pilot of the teen MHFA course was undertaken to examine the feasibility of providing the program in Australian secondary schools, to test relevant measures of student knowledge, attitudes and behaviours, and to provide initial evidence of program effects.
   Results: Across four schools, 988 students received the teen MHFA program. 520 students with a mean age of 16 years completed the baseline questionnaire, 345 completed the post-test and 241 completed the three-month follow-up. Statistically significant improvements were found in mental health literacy, confidence in providing Mental Health First Aid to a peer, help-seeking intentions and student mental health, while stigmatising attitudes significantly reduced.
   Conclusions: teen MHFA appears to be an effective and feasible program for training high school students in Mental Health First Aid techniques. Further research is required with a randomized controlled design to elucidate the causal role of the program in the changes observed.

AB Objective: Oral communication between health care providers and patients the "oral exchange" greatly impacts patient health outcomes; however, only recently have health literacy inquiries been incorporated into this field. This review examines the intersection between oral and aural literacy and the oral exchange.
   Methods: A systematic literature search was carried out. Papers published in English since 2003 that specifically examine oral/aural literacy and oral patient-provider communication were included.
   Results: The search yielded 999 articles, 12 of which were included in this review. Three tools have been developed to measure either patient or provider oral/aural literacy. There is a discrepancy between patient and provider oral/aural literacy levels, and high literacy demand is associated with reduced patient learning. Low patient oral/aural literacy is associated with poor health outcomes. Two interventions have been developed to reduce literacy demand.
   Conclusion: This review demonstrates the critical role of oral and aural literacy in the oral exchange, the importance of reducing literacy demand, and the need for future research in this field.
   Practice implications: Recommendations include the use of plain language and teach-back by providers, as well as incorporation of awareness of oral and aural literacy into community programs and health care provider education and training, (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Advancing health literacy has the potential to improve patient outcomes. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons' (AAOS) online patient education materials serve as a tool to improve health literacy for orthopaedic patients; however, it is unknown whether the materials currently meet the National Institutes of Health/American Medical Association's recommended sixth grade readability guidelines for health information or the mean US adult reading level of eighth grade.
   The purposes of this study were (1) to evaluate the mean grade level readability of online AAOS patient education materials; and (2) to determine what proportion of the online materials exceeded recommended (sixth grade) and mean US (eighth grade) reading level.
   Reading grade levels for 99.6% (260 of 261) of the online patient education entries from the AAOS were analyzed using the Flesch-Kincaid formula built into Microsoft Word software.
   Mean grade level readability of the AAOS patient education materials was 9.2 (SD +/- A 1.6). Two hundred fifty-one of the 260 articles (97%) had a readability score above the sixth grade level. The readability of the AAOS articles exceeded the sixth grade level by an average of 3.2 grade levels. Of the 260 articles, 210 (81%) had a readability score above the eighth grade level, which is the average reading level of US adults.
   Most of the online patient education materials from the AAOS had readability levels that are far too advanced for many patients to comprehend. Efforts to adjust the readability of online education materials to the needs of the audience may improve the health literacy of orthopaedic patients. Patient education materials can be made more comprehensible through use of simpler terms, shorter sentences, and the addition of pictures. More broadly, all health websites, not just those of the AAOS, should aspire to be comprehensible to the typical reader.

TI A critical review of population health literacy assessment
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English

DE Critical health literacy; Community health literacy assessment
ID PUBLIC-HEALTH; PATHWAY; CARE; TOOL
AB Background: Defining health literacy from a public health perspective places greater emphasis on the knowledge and skills required to prevent disease and for promoting health in everyday life. Addressing health literacy at the community level provides great potential for improving health knowledge, skills and behaviours resulting in better health outcomes. Yet there is a notable absence of discussion in the literature of what a health literate population looks like, or how this is best assessed.
   Discussion: The emphasis in assessing health literacy has predominantly focused on the functional health literacy of individuals in clinical settings. This review examines currently available health literacy assessment tools to identify how well suited they are in addressing health literacy beyond clinical care settings and beyond the individual. Although public health literature appears to place greater emphasis on conceptualizing critical health literacy, the focus continues to remain on assessing individuals, rather than on health literacy within the context of families, communities and population groups. When a population approach is adopted, an aggregate of individual health literacy assessment is generally used. Aggregation of individual health literacy fails to capture the dynamic and often synergistic relationships within communities, and fails to reflect societal influences on health knowledge, beliefs and behaviours.
   We hypothesise that a different assessment framework is required to adequately address the complexities of community health literacy. We assert that a public health approach, founded on health promotion theories provides a useful scaffold to assess the critical health literacy of population groups. It is proposed that inclusion of community members in the research process is a necessary requirement to coproduce such an appropriate assessment framework.
   Summary: We contend that health literacy assessment and potential interventions need to shift to promoting the knowledge and skills essential for critical health literacy at a societal level. The challenge for researchers is to negotiate the myriad of complexities associated with each concept and component required for this task.

AB Measurement methods for chemicals in biological and personal environmental samples have expanded rapidly and become a cornerstone of health studies and public health surveillance. These measurements raise questions about whether and how to report individual results to study participants, particularly when health effects and exposure reduction strategies are uncertain. In an era of greater public participation and open disclosure in science, researchers and institutional review boards (IRBs) need new guidance on changing norms and best practices. Drawing on the experiences of researchers, IRBs, and study participants, we discuss ethical frameworks, effective methods, and outcomes in studies that have reported personal results for a wide range of environmental chemicals. Belmont Report principles and community-based participatory research ethics imply responsibilities to report individual results, and several recent biomonitoring guidance documents call for individual reports. Meaningful report-back includes contextual information about health implications and exposure reduction strategies. Both narrative and graphs are helpful. Graphs comparing an individual's results with other participants in the study and benchmarks, such as the National Exposure Report, are helpful, but must be used carefully to avoid incorrect inferences that higher results are necessarily harmful or lower results are safe. Methods can be tailored for specific settings by involving participants and community members in planning. Participants and researchers who have participated in report-back identified benefits: increasing trust in science, retention in cohort studies, environmental health literacy, individual and community empowerment, and motivation to reduce exposures. Researchers as well as participants gained unexpected insights into the characteristics and sources of environmental contamination. Participants are almost universally eager to receive their results and do not regret getting them. Ethical considerations and empirical experience both support study participants' right to know their own results if they choose, so report-back should become the norm in studies that measure personal exposures. Recent studies provide models that are compiled in a handbook to help research partnerships that are planning report-back. Thoughtful report-back can strengthen research experiences for investigators and participants and expand the translation of environmental health research in communities.

TI Measurement of Cancer Health Literacy and Identification of Patients

SO JOURNAL OF HEALTH COMMUNICATION

ID LIKELIHOOD; OUTCOMES; ADULTS
AB Health literacy is related to a broad range of health outcomes. This study was designed to develop a psychometrically sound instrument designed to measure cancer health literacy along a continuum (CHLT-30), to develop another instrument designed to determine whether a patient has limited cancer health literacy (CHLT-6), and to estimate the prevalence of limited cancer health literacy. The Cancer Health Literacy Study involving 1,306 Black and White cancer patients was conducted between April 2011 and April 2013 in the Virginia Commonwealth University Massey Cancer Center and surrounding oncology clinics. A continuous latent variable modeling framework was adopted to dimensionally represent cancer health literacy, whereas discrete latent variable modeling was used to estimate the prevalence rates of limited cancer health literacy. Self confidence about engaging in health decisions was used as the primary outcome in external validation of new instruments. Results from a comprehensive analysis strongly supported the construct validity and reliability of the CHLT-30 and CHLT-6. For both instruments, measurement invariance tests ruled out item/test bias to explain gender and race/ethnicity differences in test scores. The limited cancer health literacy rate was 18%, a subpopulation consisting of overrepresented Black, undereducated, and low-income cancer patients. Overall, the results supported the conclusion that the CHLT-30 accurately measures cancer health literacy along a continuum and that the CHLT-6 efficiently identifies patients with limited cancer health literacy with high accuracy.

AB Background: "Mental health for everyone" is a school program for mental health literacy and prevention aimed at secondary schools (13-15 yrs). The main aim was to investigate whether mental health literacy, could be improved by a 3-days universal education programme by: a) improving naming of symptom profiles of mental disorder, b) reducing prejudiced beliefs, and c) improving knowledge about where to seek help for mental health problems. A secondary aim was to investigate whether adolescent sex and age influenced the above mentioned variables. A third aim was to investigate whether prejudiced beliefs influenced knowledge about available help.
   Method: This non-randomized cluster controlled trial included 1070 adolescents (53.9% boys, M age14 yrs) from three schools in a Norwegian town. One school (n = 520) received the intervention, and two schools (n = 550) formed the control group. Pre-test and follow-up were three months apart. Linear mixed models and generalized estimating equations models were employed for analysis.
   Results: Mental health literacy improved contingent on the intervention, and there was a shift towards suggesting primary health care as a place to seek help. Those with more prejudiced beleifs did not suggest places to seek help for mental health problems. Generally, girls and older adolescents recognized symptom profiles better and had lower levels of prejudiced beliefs.
   Conclusions: A low cost general school program may improve mental health literacy in adolescents. Gender specific programs and attention to the age and maturity of the students should be considered when mental health literacy programmes are designed and tried out. Prejudice should be addressed before imparting information about mental health issues.

AB Most existing tools for measuring health literacy (HL) focus on reading comprehension and numeracy in English speakers. The aim of this study was to develop a generic HL measure for Japanese adults.
   A questionnaire survey was conducted among participants in multiphasic health examinations at a Japanese healthcare facility. HL was measured using the 14-item health literacy scale (HLS-14) that was adapted from the HL scale specific to diabetic patients developed by Ishikawa and colleagues. The 14 items consist of five items for functional HL, five items for communicative HL, and four items for critical HL. The reliability and validity of the HLS-14 were assessed among 1,507 eligible respondents aged 30-69 years.
   Explanatory factor analysis produced a three-factor solution that was very similar to the original HL scale. Cronbach's alpha indicated satisfactory internal consistency of the functional, communicative, and critical HL scores (0.83, 0.85, and 0.76, respectively). There were no floor or ceiling effects in each HL score. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed an acceptable fit of the three-factor model (comparative fit index = 0.912, normed fit index = 0.905, root mean square error of approximation = 0.082). When the two groups with a total HL score above and below the median (50), respectively, were compared, those who could obtain medication information satisfactorily and those who wanted to participate in making medication decisions were more frequently observed in the group with the higher score.
   The HLS-14 demonstrated adequate reliability and validity as a generic HL measure for Japanese adults. This scale can be utilized for measuring functional, communicative, and critical HL in the clinical and public health contexts.

AB Background: The global burden of diabetes and other non-communicable diseases is rising dramatically worldwide and is causing a double poor health burden in low-and middle-income countries. Early life influences play an important part in this scenario because maternal lifestyle and conditions such as gestational diabetes and obesity affect the risk of diabetes in the next generation. This indicates important periods during the lifecourse when interventions could have powerful affects in reducing incidence of non-communicable diseases. However, interventions to promote diet and lifestyle in prospective parents before conception have not received sufficient attention, especially in low-and middle-income countries undergoing socio-economic transition.
   Discussion: Interventions to produce weight loss in adults or to reduce weight gain in pregnancy have had limited success and might be too late to produce the largest effects on the health of the child and his/her later risk of non-communicable diseases. A very important factor in the prevention of the developmental component of diabetes risk is the physiological state in which the parents enter pregnancy. We argue that the most promising strategy to improve prospective parents' body composition and lifestyle is the promotion of health literacy in adolescents. Multiple but integrated forms of community-based interventions that focus on nutrition, physical activity, family planning, breastfeeding and infant feeding practices are needed. They need to address the wider social economic context in which adolescents live and to be linked with existing public health programmes in sexual and reproductive health and maternal and child health initiatives.
   Summary: Interventions aimed at ensuring a healthy body composition, diet and lifestyle before pregnancy offer a most effective solution in many settings, especially in low-and middle-income countries undergoing socio-economic transition. Preparing a mother, her partner and her future child for "the 1000 days", whether from planned or unplanned conception would break the cycle of risk and demonstrate benefit in the shortest possible time. Such interventions will be particularly important in adolescents and young women in disadvantaged groups and can improve the physiological status of the fetus as well as reduce the prevalence of pregnancy conditions such as gestational diabetes mellitus which both predispose to non-communicables diseases in both the mother and her child. Pre-conception interventions require equipping prospective parents with the necessary knowledge and skills to make healthy lifestyle choices for themselves and their children. Addressing the promotion of such health literacy in parents-to-be in low-and middle-income countries requires a wider social perspective. It requires a range of multisectoral agencies to work together and could be linked to the issues of women's empowerment, to reproductive health, to communicable disease prevention and to the Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5.

TI Public recognition of mental disorders and beliefs about treatment:
   changes in Australia over 16 years
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH LITERACY; AMERICANS ATTITUDES; SOUTH-AUSTRALIA; NATIONAL-SURVEY;
   DEPRESSION; INTERVENTIONS; PSYCHIATRISTS; CAMPAIGNS; ABILITY; STIGMA
AB Background
   A 1995 Australian national survey of mental health literacy showed poor recognition of disorders and beliefs about treatment that differed from those of health professionals. A similar survey carried out in 2003/4 showed some improvements over 8 years.
   Aims
   To investigate whether recognition of mental disorders and beliefs about treatment have changed over a 16-year period.
   Method
   A national survey of 6019 adults was carried out in 2011 using the same questions as the 1995 and 2003/4 surveys.
   Results
   Results showed improved recognition of depression and more positive ratings for a range of interventions, including help from mental health professionals and antidepressants.
   Conclusions
   Although beliefs about effective medications and interventions have moved closer to those of health professionals since the previous surveys, there is still potential for mental health literacy gains in the areas of recognition and treatment beliefs for mental disorders. This is particularly the case for schizophrenia.

ID WEB-BASED INFORMATION; WORLD-WIDE-WEB; HEALTH INFORMATION; INTERNET
   INFORMATION; MEDICAL INFORMATION; HELP-SEEKING; BIPOLAR DISORDER;
   DEPRESSION; SITES; SCHIZOPHRENIA
AB Objective: This paper reviews studies assessing the quality of websites providing information about mental disorders.
   Methods: The review included 31 articles identified by searching research databases in March 2010. Topics covered included affective disorders, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, substance use disorders and schizophrenia/psychosis.
   Results: The largest number of articles (13) reported studies assessing affective disorder information quality. Methodologies varied in site selection and rating methods, with some of limited validity. Most concluded that quality was poor, although quality of affective disorder sites may be improving.
   Conclusion: There is currently very little understanding of the influence of website quality on user behaviour. Future quality assessments might use the criteria informed by key behaviour change theories. Practice implications: A possible approach to research on websites and user behaviour might be to develop an evaluation framework incorporating strategies from behaviour change models, key mental health literacy elements and health outcomes relevant to mental health promotion.

ID COMMUNICATION
AB This article delineates specific issues relating to health literacy for Indigenous Australians. Drawing on the extensive experience of the authors' work with Yolnu people (of north-east Arnhem Land) and using one model for health literacy described in the international literature, various components of health literacy are explored, including fundamental literacy, scientific literacy, community literacy and cultural literacy. By matching these components to the characteristics of Yolnu people, the authors argue that language and worldview form an integral part of health education methodology when working with Indigenous people whose first language is not English and who do not have a biomedical worldview in their history. Only through acknowledging and actively engaging with these characteristics of Indigenous people can all aspects of health literacy be addressed and health empowerment be attained.

TI Explanatory models of mental disorders and treatment practices among

SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY

DT Article
DE Explanatory models; Traditional healers; Mental illness; South Africa
ID ILLNESS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; AMAFUFUNYANA; HEALTH; HARARE; CARE
AB Objective: In many traditional belief systems in Africa, including South Africa, mental health problems may be attributed to the influence of ancestors or to bewitchment. Traditional healers are viewed as having the expertise to address these causes. However, there is limited information on their explanatory models and consequent treatment practices. The present study examines traditional healers' explanatory models (EMs) and treatment practices for psychotic and non-psychotic mental illnesses. Method: 4 focus group discussions (8 healers in each group) and 18 in-depth interviews were conducted. Four vignettes were presented (schizophrenia, depression, panic and somatization) and traditional healers' views on the nature of the problem, cause, consequence, treatment and patient expectations were elicited. Results: Traditional healers held multiple explanatory models for psychotic and non-psychotic disorders. Psychotic illnesses appear to be the main exemplar of mental illness and were treated with traditional medicine, while non-psychotic illnesses were not viewed as a mental illness at all. Additionally traditional healers do not only use herbs and substances solely from "traditional" sources but rather have incorporated into their treatment practices modern ingredients that are potentially toxic. Conclusion: Interventions aimed at increasing the mental health literacy of traditional healers are essential. In addition, investigations of the effectiveness of traditional healer treatment for psychiatric disorders should be conducted.

TI Numeracy Skills Explain Racial Differences in HIV Medication Management
SO AIDS AND BEHAVIOR

DT Article
DE African American; Disparities; Numeracy; Medication management
ID FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY; ADHERENCE; INFECTION; KNOWLEDGE; PERFORMANCE
AB Racial disparities in HIV/AIDS are well established and efforts to understand key factors that may explain these differences are needed. Recent evidence suggests that health literacy may contribute to disparities in health behaviors among African American HIV patients. One component of health literacy, numeracy, is emerging as an important skill for successful self management of medications. We therefore tested whether numeracy mediated the effects of race on medication management among HIV seropositive patients. Results showed that poor management of a simulated HIV medication regimen among African Americans and women was mediated by lower numeracy. Poor medication self-management may be a significant root cause for health disparities in African Americans with HIV/AIDS. Whether African American women may be at particular risk requires further study. Interventions to improve HIV medication self-management through addressing numeracy skills may help to narrow the gap in health disparities among African Americans with HIV/AIDS.

AB The decision aid called "Adjuvant Online'' (Adjuvant! for short) helps breast cancer patients make treatment decisions by providing numerical estimates of treatment efficacy (e. g., 10-y relapse or survival). Studies exploring how patients' numeracy interacts with the estimates provided by Adjuvant! are lacking. Pooling across 2 studies totaling 105 women with estrogen receptor-positive, early-stage breast cancer, the authors explored patients' treatment expectations, perceived benefit from treatments, and confidence of personal benefit from treatments. Patients who were more numerate were more likely to provide estimates of cancer-free survival that matched the estimates provided by Adjuvant! for each treatment option compared with patients with lower numeracy (odds ratios of 1.6 to 2.4). As estimates of treatment efficacy provided by Adjuvant! increased, so did patients' estimates of cancer-free survival (0.37 > r(s) > 0.48) and their perceptions of treatment benefit from hormonal therapy (r(s) = 0.28) and combined therapy (rs = 0.27). These relationships were significantly more pronounced for those with higher numeracy, especially for perceived benefit of combined therapy. Results suggest that numeracy influences a patient's ability to interpret numerical estimates of treatment efficacy from decision aids such as Adjuvant!.

AB Adults aged 65 and older account for one third of all hospitalizations in the United States.(1) Almost one fifth (19.6%) of Medicare beneficiaries discharged from an acute care hospital are readmitted within 30 days.(2) High readmission rates have been attributed to inadequate discharge preparation, lack of patient and family caregiver readiness, poor discharge transition coordination, and unsuccessful coping with the demands of daily living.(3-9) Discharge needs may be different for older adults than for the general population because of the increased likelihood of multiple comorbidities, illness-induced limitations, impaired mobility, fatigue, anxiety, cognitive impairment, hearing impairments, health literacy deficits, and living alone.(7,8,10-12)
   The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in perceptions of the quality of discharge teaching and readiness for hospital discharge and their relationship to post-discharge utilization of emergency department (ED) visits and readmissions across the older adult age spectrum. Of particular interest is the applicability of quality of discharge teaching and discharge readiness assessment tools for the older adult population. (Geriatr Nurs 2010;31:178-187)

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze the scoring obtained by an instrument, which evaluates the ability to read and understand items in the health care setting, according to education and age.
   METHODS: The short version of the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults was administered to 312 healthy participants of different ages and years of schooling. The study was conducted between 2006 and 2007, in the city of Sao Paulo, Southeastern Brazil. The test includes actual materials such as pill bottles and appointment slips and measures reading comprehension, assessing the ability to read and correctly pronounce a list of words and understand both prose passages and numerical information. Pearson partial correlations and a multiple regression model were used to verify the association between its scores and education and age.
   RESULTS: The mean age of the sample was 47.3 years (SD=16.8) and the mean education was 9.7 years (SD=5; range: 1-17). A total of 32.4% of the sample showed literacy/numeracy deficits, scoring in the inadequate and marginal functional health literacy ranges. Among the elderly (65 years or older) this rate increased to 51.6%. There was a positive correlation between schooling and scores (r=0.74; p<0.01) and a negative correlation between age and the scores (r=-0.259; p<0.01). The correlation between the scores and age was not significant when the effects of education were held constant (rp=-0.031, p=0.584). A significant association (B=3.877, Beta=0.733; p<0.001) was found between schooling and scores. Age was not a significant predictor in this model (B=-0.035, Beta=-0.22; p=0.584).
   CONCLUSIONS: The short version of the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults was a suitable tool to assess health literacy in the study population. The high number of individuals classified as functional illiterates in this test highlights the importance of special assistance to help them properly understand directions for healthcare.

TI Community beliefs about treatments and outcomes of mental disorders: A
   mental health literacy survey in a rural area of Maharashtra, India
SO PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Mental health; Health knowledge, attitudes, practices; Depression;
   Psychosis; India
AB Objectives: Mental health remains a neglected issue in most developing countries, especially in rural areas where access to effective mental health services is limited. The integration of mental health into primary health care is being promoted as a strategy to address this problem. Consequently, there is an urgent need to enhance mental health awareness among communities, and to provide mental health training for primary healthcare staff. In order to do this effectively, it is important to understand and take account of local views on mental health and illness. As such, a mental health literacy (MHL) assessment was undertaken in a poor, rural area of Maharashtra, India to inform the development of a mental health training programme.
   Study design: A cross-sectional MHL survey was undertaken in late 2007.
   Methods: Data were collected from 240 systematically sampled community members and 60 purposively sampled village health workers (VHWs) using an interviewer-ad ministered questionnaire. Participants were presented with two vignettes describing people experiencing symptoms of mental disorders (depression, psychosis), and were asked to name the problems, and to identify the treatments and people that were most likely to be helpful (or otherwise), and the likely outcomes for people with such problems.
   Results: Most participants recognized that the people in the vignettes were experiencing a mental health problem. 'Depression' was the most common label for the problems experienced in the depression vignette, and 'a mind/brain problem' was the most common label in the case of the psychosis vignette. Socio-economic interventions provided by family, friends and neighbours were considered to be most helpful. Local VHWs and doctors were also viewed as potentially helpful, but psychiatrists less so. Approximately half of the sample thought that dealing with the problem alone would be helpful. Special diets, tonics, appetite stimulants and sleeping pills were also strongly endorsed, but awareness of psychiatric medications was negligible.
   Conclusion: The findings from this study highlight the need to enhance MHL in this community. Additionally, there is a need to build the capacity of the primary healthcare staff, including the VHWs, so that they are equipped to provide an effective local response for people experiencing mental health problems.

AB Purpose
   To assess the comprehension of common medical terms used in prostate cancer in patient education materials to obtain informed consent, and to measure outcomes after prostate cancer treatment. We address this issue among underserved, African-American men because of the increased cancer incidence and mortality observed in this population.
   Patients and Methods
   We reviewed patient education materials and prostate-specific quality-of-life instruments to identify technical terms describing sexual, urinary, and bowel function. Understanding of these terms was assessed in face-to-face interviews of 105, mostly African-American men, age >= 40, from two low-income clinics. Comprehension was evaluated using semiqualitative methods coded by two independent investigators. Demographics were collected and literacy was measured.
   Results
   Fewer than 50% of patients understood the terms "erection" or "impotent." Only 5% of patients understood the term "incontinence" and 25% understood the term "bowel habits." More patients recognized word roots than related terms or compound words (eg, "rectum" v "rectal urgency," "intercourse" v "vaginal intercourse"). Comprehension of terms from all domains was statistically significantly correlated with reading level (P < .001). Median literacy level was fourth to sixth grade. Prostate cancer knowledge was poor. Many patients had difficulty locating key anatomic structures.
   Conclusion
   Limited comprehension of prostate cancer terms and low literacy create barriers to obtaining informed consent for treatment and to measuring prostate cancer outcomes accurately in our study population. In addition, the level of prostate cancer knowledge was poor. These results highlight the need for prostate cancer education efforts and outcomes measurements that consider literacy and use nonmedical language. J Clin Oncol 27: 2015-2021.

AB A caregiver may fail to recognize or respond to a child's medical needs for a variety of reasons. An effective response by a health care professional to medical neglect requires a comprehensive assessment of the child's needs, the parents' resources, the parents' efforts to provide for the needs of the child, and options for ensuring optimal health for the child. Such an assessment requires clear, 2-way communication between the family and the health care professional. Physicians should consider the least intrusive options for managing cases of medical neglect that ensure the health and safety of the child.

AB PURPOSE. To understand factors that influence African-Americans' attitude toward eye examinations.
   METHODS. Ten focus groups were conducted with 86 African-Americans. Four focus groups were conducted with people 65 years of age and older who had not received a dilated fundus examination (DFE) in the past 2 years, two groups were held with people 65 years of age and older who had had a recent DFE, and two groups each were held with people 40 to 64 years of age, with and without recent DFEs. Focus group interviews were conducted by using a moderator guide to address perceived benefits of and barriers to getting an eye examination; motivators for getting, DFEs; and knowledge of eye examinations, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy. Participants also completed a questionnaire that provided demographic information. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted.
   RESULTS. Cost or lack of sufficient insurance was identified as the most important barrier to getting a DFE. Also frequently mentioned was not having any symptoms and being too busy. The most frequently cited benefit of getting a DFE was to help prevent eye disease, whereas the most frequently reported motivating factor was experiencing a vision problem. Regarding knowledge, many people did not know the risk factors for glaucoma, but seemed to have a better understanding of how to reduce the effects of diabetes on their eyes.
   CONCLUSIONS. Study findings identified important links between financial resources and experiencing a vision problem and the adoption of preventive eye care in an urban African-American population.

AB Background The stigmatisation of the mentally ill is considered a well-established fact. To improve negative attitudes among the general public, we need to identify the factors that cause them. Drawing from previous studies, we combined a variety of variables to examine a comprehensive explanative model. Objectives We examined a sample of the Dutch public on their willingness to interact with mental patients. We examined a number of determinants concerning their influence on levels of social distance: demographical characteristics of the public, their beliefs about stereotypes of mental patients, their beliefs about causes of mental problems, their familiarity with mental illness. Methods We employed a questionnaire survey among two sub-samples of the Dutch public (n = 812, response 33%). Results Attributing psychiatric problems to structural causes (i.e. causes beyond patients' control and responsibility, such as genetic transmission) is associated with less social distance. Conversely, attribution to individual factors (e.g. drug abuse) related to more distant attitudes. Stereotypical beliefs about mental patients (e.g. untrustworthiness, aggressiveness, causing disturbances) relate to more social distance from mental patients. Conclusions Results implied that our comprehensive model explains only a modest amount of variance, but shows that to improve public mental health literacy and attitudes should first deal with the most negative stereotypical beliefs.

AB The objectives of this cross-sectional study were to measure health literacy and its associations with asthma patients' assessments of care and their desire to participate in making decisions about their treatment. A total of 175 patients completed the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults and questions about satisfaction with asthma status, access to care, quality of care, and the desire to participate in treatment decisions. Patients' mean age was 42 years and 83% were women. Lower literacy was associated with less satisfaction with asthma status and worse assessment of quality of care received for asthma and other medical conditions (p = .005). Patients with lower literacy also were more likely not to want to participate in decisions about their care (OR .29, 95% CI .13, .65). These relationships persisted after controlling for demographic and asthma characteristics. These results provide additional incentives for physicians to find better ways to explain asthma treatments to low literacy patients.

AB This policy statement defines culturally effective health care and describes its importance for pediatrics and the health of children. The statement also defines cultural effectiveness, cultural sensitivity, and cultural competence and describes the importance of these concepts for training in medical school, residency, and continuing medical education. The statement is based on the conviction that culturally effective health care is vital and a critical social value and that the knowledge and skills necessary for providing culturally effective health care can be taught and acquired through focused curricula throughout the spectrum of lifelong learning, from premedical education and medical school through residency and continuing medical education. The American Academy of Pediatrics also believes that these educational efforts must be supported through health policy and advocacy activities that promote the delivery of culturally effective pediatric care.

AB patient education has evolved from its medically-dominated and narrow origin in patient teaching to support of patient empowerment in interpersonal, organizational, and policy domains relevant to health. This essay reflects on both the historical and contemporary context of patient education in the US and explores implications of the empowerment movement on new initiatives and directions in patient education. By using diabetes education as an exemplar, innovations in patient activation and empowerment are explored and future directions and challenges to the field are considered.

AB Objectives: Previous studies have shown relationships among personality, perceived efficacy, and proactive health behaviors. Although health behaviors are particularly important among seniors, little is known regarding predictors of health behaviors in older adults. The current study examined the extent to which facets of personality, perceived health competence (PHC), and health status predicted health behaviors among older adults. Methods: Ninety-seven older adults responded to questionnaires assessing health status, personality, PHC, and level of engagement in certain health behaviors. Results: Whereas higher levels of Conscientiousness and lower levels of Neuroticism predicted a greater likelihood of engaging in social support/relaxation behaviors, after controlling for health status and education, higher levels of PHC predicted greater exercise and dietary/health information-seeking behaviors. Discussion: These findings suggest the importance of considering facets of personality and PHC when evaluating health care strategies for the elderly.

AB An emerging view in the literature regarding health locus of control (NLC) and health behavior suggests that HLC beliefs might affect behavior only through the interaction of HLC with other health-related expectancies. We examined internal and powerful others HLC beliefs as moderators of the relationship between a recently developed measure of ''perceived health competence'' and medical regimen adherence in 81 renal dialysis patients. The hypothesized interaction was significant, suggesting a moderating role for HLC. The pattern of the interaction differed from prediction. Greater perceived health competence was associated with more favorable adherence only for those patients scoring low on internal and high on powerful others HLC, This pattern suggests that a high degree of perceived competence is advantageous for those patients with predominant confidence in the actions of their health-care providers.

TI Stroke survivors' and informal caregivers' experiences of primary care
   and community healthcare services - A systematic review and
   meta-ethnography
SO PLOS ONE

AB Objective
   To describe and explain stroke survivors and informal caregivers' experiences of primary care and community healthcare services. To offer potential solutions for how negative experiences could be addressed by healthcare services.
   Design
   Systematic review and meta-ethnography.
   Data sources
   Medline, CINAHL, Embase and PsycINFO databases (literature searched until May 2015, published studies ranged from 1996 to 2015).
   Eligibility criteria
   Primary qualitative studies focused on adult community-dwelling stroke survivors' and/or informal caregivers' experiences of primary care and/or community healthcare services.
   Data synthesis
   A set of common second order constructs (original authors' interpretations of participants' experiences) were identified across the studies and used to develop a novel integrative account of the data (third order constructs). Study quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist. Relevance was assessed using Dixon-Woods' criteria.
   Results
   51 studies (including 168 stroke survivors and 328 caregivers) were synthesised. We developed three inter-dependent third order constructs: (1) marginalisation of stroke survivors and caregivers by healthcare services, (2) passivity versus proactivity in the relationship between health services and the patient/caregiver dyad, and (3) fluidity of stroke related needs for both patient and caregiver. Issues of continuity of care, limitations in access to services and inadequate information provision drove perceptions of marginalisation and passivity of services for both patients and caregivers. Fluidity was apparent through changing information needs and psychological adaptation to living with long-term consequences of stroke.
   Limitations
   Potential limitations of qualitative research such as limited generalisability and inability to provide firm answers are offset by the consistency of the findings across a range of countries and healthcare systems.
   Conclusions
   Stroke survivors and caregivers feel abandoned because they have become marginalised by services and they do not have the knowledge or skills to re-engage. This can be addressed by: (1) increasing stroke specific health literacy by targeted and timely information provision, and (2) improving continuity of care between specialist and generalist services.

AB This study examined self-stigma of seeking psychological help and mental health literacy as predictors of college students' (N = 1,535) help-seeking attitudes, with additional attention to psychological and demographic correlates. Results indicated that mental health literacy predicted help-seeking attitudes above and beyond self-stigma. Asian American race/ethnicity, male gender, current psychological distress, and help-seeking history were also significant predictors. Implications for addressing mental health literacy and self-stigma while attending to demographic and psychological variations in help seeking are discussed.

AB This systematic review describes the current relationship between health literacy (HL) and vaccination (including attitude to vaccines, intention to vaccinate, and vaccine uptake). The aim is to comprehend the role of HL as a determinant of vaccine hesitancy. For this purpose, the following databases were explored from 1 January 2007 to 15 January 2017: PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, ERIC, Health Evidence, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Nine studies were included in the final synthesis. The role of HL in predicting vaccine hesitancy or acceptance seems to be influenced by a few key factors. These include country, age, and type of vaccine. However, the relationship between HL and vaccination remains unclear. New research studies are needed-particularly longitudinal ones that use multiple measurement tools. This would facilitate a better understanding of the role of HL in predicting vaccine uptake.

AB This study assesses the associations between health literacy and various health behaviors and social factors among older adults, and whether social factors moderate the other associations. Data from 3,241 participants in the LifeLines Cohort Study were analyzed (mean baseline age = 68.9 years). Data on health literacy, health behaviors (physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, smoking, breakfast consumption, alcohol consumption, and body mass index (BMI), and social factors (loneliness, social support, social activities, social contacts, and living situation) were collected in three waves. Logistic regression analyses were used, adjusted for age and gender. Low health literacy was associated with insufficient physical activity, insufficient fruit and vegetable consumption, lack of regular breakfast consumption, obesity (odds ratios (ORs) > 1.31, p-values < .005) and low alcohol use (OR = 0.81, p = .013), but not with smoking. Low health literacy was also associated with greater loneliness, engaging in fewer social activities, and having fewer social contacts (ORs > 1.48, p-values < .005), but not with social support or living situation. Only the association between health literacy and smoking was moderated by social contacts, but this finding needs confirmation in future studies. In conclusion, low health literacy is negatively associated with health behaviors and social factors in older adults, but social factors seldom moderate the associations between health literacy and health behaviors.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine whether provision of vaccine-health-literacy-promoting information in text message vaccine reminders improves receipt and timeliness of the second dose of influenza vaccine within a season for children in need of 2 doses.
   METHODS: During the 2012-2013 season, families of eligible 6-month through 8-year-old children were recruited at the time of their first influenza vaccination from 3 community clinics in New York City. Children (n = 660) were randomly assigned to "educational" text message, "conventional" text message, and "written reminder-only" arms. At enrollment, all arms received a written reminder with next dose due date. Conventional messages included second dose due date and clinic walk-in hours. Educational messages added information regarding the need for a timely second dose. Receipt of second dose by April 30 was assessed by using chi(2) tests. Timeliness was assessed by receipt of second dose by 2 weeks after due date (day 42) using chi(2) and over time using a Kaplan-Meier analysis.
   RESULTS: Most families were Latino and publicly insured with no significant between-arm differences between groups. Children in the educational arm were more likely to receive a second dose by April 30 (72.7%) versus conventional (66.7%) versus written reminder-only arm (57.1%; P = .003). They also had more timely receipt by day 42 (P < .001) and over time (P < .001).
   CONCLUSIONS: In this low-income, urban, minority population, embedding health literacy information improved the effectiveness of text message reminders in promoting timely delivery of a second dose of influenza vaccine, compared with conventional text messages and written reminder only.

AB Background: During the past 2 decades, the Internet has evolved to become a necessity in our daily lives. The selection and sorting algorithms of search engines exert tremendous influence over the global spread of information and other communication processes.
   Objective: This study is concerned with demonstrating the influence of selection and sorting/ranking criteria operating in search engines on users' knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes of websites about vaccination. In particular, it is to compare the effects of search engines that deliver websites emphasizing on the pro side of vaccination with those focusing on the con side and with normal Google as a control group.
   Method: We conducted 2 online experiments using manipulated search engines. A pilot study was to verify the existence of dangerous health literacy in connection with searching and using health information on the Internet by exploring the effect of 2 manipulated search engines that yielded either pro or con vaccination sites only, with a group receiving normal Google as control. A pre-post test design was used; participants were American marketing students enrolled in a study-abroad program in Lugano, Switzerland. The second experiment manipulated the search engine by applying different ratios of con versus pro vaccination webpages displayed in the search results. Participants were recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform where it was published as a human intelligence task (HIT).
   Results: Both experiments showed knowledge highest in the group offered only pro vaccination sites (Z=-2.088, P=.03; Kruskal-Wallis H test [H-5]=11.30, P=.04). They acknowledged the importance/benefits (Z=-2.326, P=.02; H-5=11.34, P=.04) and effectiveness (Z=-2.230, P=.03) of vaccination more, whereas groups offered antivaccination sites only showed increased concern about effects (Z=-2.582, P=.01; H-5=16.88, P=.005) and harmful health outcomes (Z=-2.200, P=.02) of vaccination. Normal Google users perceived information quality to be positive despite a small effect on knowledge and a negative effect on their beliefs and attitudes toward vaccination and willingness to recommend the information (chi(2)(5)=14.1, P=.01). More exposure to antivaccination websites lowered participants' knowledge (J=4783.5, z=-2.142, P=.03) increased their fear of side effects (J=6496, z=2.724, P=.006), and lowered their acknowledgment of benefits (J=4805, z=-2.067, P=.03).
   Conclusion: The selection and sorting/ranking criteria of search engines play a vital role in online health information seeking. Search engines delivering websites containing credible and evidence-based medical information impact positively Internet users seeking health information. Whereas sites retrieved by biased search engines create some opinion change in users. These effects are apparently independent of users' site credibility and evaluation judgments. Users are affected beneficially or detrimentally but are unaware, suggesting they are not consciously perceptive of indicators that steer them toward the credible sources or away from the dangerous ones. In this sense, the online health information seeker is flying blind.

AB BACKGROUND & AIMS: Optimal colonoscopy preparation requires patients to adhere to written instructions and be activated to complete the task. Among patients with chronic disease, health literacy and patient activation have been associated with outcome, but these factors have not been studied for colonoscopy. We examined the association between health literacy, patient activation, and quality of bowel preparation.
   METHODS: We analyzed outpatient colonoscopy results from 462 adults, 55-74 years old (mean, 62 +/- 6 years), who previously completed extensive neurocognitive assessments as part of a prospective study (Health Literacy and Cognitive Function in Older Adults). We collected information on cecal intubation, polyp detection, bowel preparation quality, and histopathology.
   RESULTS: One-third of the patients (n = 134) had suboptimal quality of bowel preparation; 15% (n = 62) had fair quality, and 17% (n = 72) had poor quality. Limited health literacy was associated with a lower level of education (P < .001), diabetes (P < .001), and a higher number of chronic conditions (P <.001), but not quality of colonoscopy preparation. No baseline characteristics were associated with patient activation. In multivariable analysis, after adjusting for demographics and clinical characteristics, diabetes (odds ratio [OR], 2.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-5.25) and patient activation (OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.30-3.45) were independent predictors of suboptimal bowel preparation quality, but limited health literacy was not (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.38-1.52).
   CONCLUSIONS: We investigated the relationship between health literacy, patient activation, and colonoscopy preparation quality. Lower patient activation was an independent predictor of suboptimal bowel preparation quality. Interventions to improve colonoscopy preparation quality should consider the importance of patient activation within their design.

AB Despite the growing body of health information available online, patients with limited health literacy may lack either internet access or skills necessary to utilize this information. Nonetheless, patients at all health literacy levels may prefer other primary sources to obtain health information. We conducted a cross-sectional study to measure health literacy of patients attending two clinics in Dallas, TX and determine associations between health literacy, health information access and internet usage before and after controlling for confounders. Patients from both clinics (county N = 265; private N = 233) completed a brief survey which included sociodemographics, internet patterns, confidence in filling out medical forms and a self-administered Newest Vital Sign to measure health literacy. In the county clinic, most patients (61.5 %) were Hispanic, had low income (<$19,000/year), limited education (< 11th grade) and a high likelihood or possibility of limited health literacy (68.5 %). In the private clinic, participants were mostly black (40.4 %) or white (38.6 %), had higher incomes (a parts per thousand yen$46,000), higher education (technical college or college) and adequate health literacy (75.1 %). The primary source of obtaining health information in both clinics was their health care professional (50.6 % county; 40.1 % private). In multivariate analyses to determine differences by health literacy level, there were no statistically significant differences between patients with limited and adequate health literacy and their primary information source. Regardless of health literacy, patients rely on their health care providers to obtain health information. These results showcase the importance of providers' effective communication with patients to make shared decisions about their health regardless of other factors.

AB Given the high morbidity and mortality among children in low- and middle-income countries as a result of preventable causes, the U.S. government and the United Nations Children's Fund convened an Evidence Summit on Enhancing Child Survival and Development in Lower- and Middle-Income Countries by Achieving Population-Level Behavior Change on June 3-4, 2013, in Washington, D.C. This article summarizes evidence for technological advances associated with population-level behavior changes necessary to advance child survival and healthy development in children under 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries. After a rigorous evidence selection process, the authors assessed science, technology, and innovation papers that used mHealth, social/transmedia, multiplatform media, health literacy, and devices for behavior changes supporting child survival and development. Because of an insufficient number of studies on health literacy and devices that supported causal attribution of interventions to outcomes, the review focused on mHealth, social/transmedia, and multiplatform media. Overall, this review found that some mHealth interventions have sufficient evidence to make topic-specific recommendations for broader implementation, scaling, and next research steps (e.g., adherence to HIV/AIDS antiretroviral therapy, uptake and demand of maternal health service, and compliance with malaria treatment guidelines). While some media evidence demonstrates effectiveness in changing cognitive abilities, knowledge, and attitudes, evidence is minimal on behavioral endpoints linked to child survival. Population level behavior change is necessary to end preventable child deaths. Donors and low- and middle-income countries are encouraged to implement recommendations for informing practice, policy, and research decisions to fully maximize the impact potential of mHealth and multimedia for child survival and development.

TI Readability Assessment of Online Ophthalmic Patient Information
SO JAMA OPHTHALMOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID INTERNET; COMPREHENSION
AB IMPORTANCE Patients increasingly use the Internet to access information related to their disease, but poor health literacy is known to impact negatively on medical outcomes. Multiple agencies have recommended that patient-oriented literature be written at a fourth- to sixth-grade (9-12 years of age) reading level to assist understanding. The readability of online patient-oriented materials related to ophthalmic diagnoses is not yet known.
   OBJECTIVE To assess the readability of online literature specifically for a range of ophthalmic conditions.
   DESIGN AND SETTING Body text of the top 10 patient-oriented websites for 16 different ophthalmic diagnoses, covering the full range of ophthalmic subspecialties, was analyzed for readability, source (United Kingdom vs non-United Kingdom, not for profit vs commercial), and appropriateness for sight-impaired readers.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Four validated readability formulas were used: Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES), Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG), and Gunning Fog Index (GFOG). Data were compared with the Mann-Whitney test (for 2 groups) and Kruskal-Wallis test (for more than 2 groups) and correlation was assessed by the Spearman r.
   RESULTS None of the 160 webpages had readability scores within published guidelines, with 83% assessed as being of "difficult" readability. Not-for-profit webpages were of significantly greater length than commercial webpages (P = .02) and UK-based webpages had slightly superior readability scores compared with those of non-UK webpages (P = .004 to P < .001, depending on the readability formula used). Of all webpages evaluated, only 34% included facility to adjust text size to assist visually impaired readers.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess readability of patient-focused webpages specifically for a range of ophthalmic diagnoses. In keeping with previous studies in other medical conditions, we determined that readability scores were inferior to those recommended, irrespective of the measure used. Although readability is only one aspect of how well a patient-oriented webpage may be comprehended, we recommend the use of readability scoring when producing such resources in the future. Minimum readability policies and inclusion of facilities within webpages to maximize viewing potential for visually impaired readers are important to ensure that online ophthalmic patient information is accessible to the broadest audience possible.

AB OBJECTIVE-Food insecurity is hypothesized to make diabetes self-management more difficult. We conducted a longitudinal assessment of food insecurity with several diabetes self-care measures.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-We conducted a secondary, observational analysis of 665 low-income patients with diabetes, all of whom received self-management support as part of a larger diabetes educational intervention. We analyzed baseline food insecurity (measured by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Security module) in relation to changes in hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) as well as self-reported diabetes self-efficacy and daily fruit and vegetable intake. We examined longitudinal differences using generalized estimating equation linear regression models, controlling for time, age, sex, race, income, and intervention arm.
   RESULTS-Overall, 57% of the sample had an income <$15,000. Participants who were food insecure (33%) were younger, had less income, and were more likely to be unemployed compared with participants who were food secure. At baseline, those who were food insecure had higher mean HbA(1c) values (8.4% vs. 8.0%) and lower self-efficacy and fruit and vegetable intake than those who were food secure (all P < 0.05). Compared with food-secure individuals, participants who were food insecure had significantly greater improvements in HbA(1c) over time (0.38% decrease compared with 0.01% decrease; P value for interaction <0.05) as well as in self-efficacy (P value for interaction <0.01). There was no significant difference in HbA(1c) by food security status at follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS-Participants experiencing food insecurity had poorer diabetes-related measures at baseline but made significant improvements in HbA(1c) and self-efficacy. Low-income patients who were food insecure may be particularly receptive to diabetes self-management support, even if interventions are not explicitly structured to address finances or food security challenges.

ID COMMUNICATION
AB Oral health literacy is a relatively new but critical concept in our efforts to decrease disparities and increase oral health for all Marylanders. Oral health literacy is important because low health literacy contributes to disease which results in increased costs for all of us. Those with low health literacy are usually at highest risk for oral diseases and problems. These individuals include the poor, those with low levels of education, minorities, and the elderly. Prompted by the untimely demise of Deamonte Driver, Maryland has taken the lead in developing a statewide approach to improving oral health literacy with the ultimate objective of reducing disparities.

AB The aim of the study was to investigate whether Australians' stigmatising attitudes towards people with mental disorders have changed over an 8-year period. In 2011, telephone interviews were carried out with 6019 Australians aged 15 or over. The survey interview used the same questions as those of the 2003/4 national mental health literacy survey, in which participants were presented with a case vignette describing either depression, depression with suicidal thoughts, early schizophrenia or chronic schizophrenia. Questions were asked about stigmatising attitudes, including personal and perceived stigma and social distance. Results showed decreases in social distance scores for all vignettes other than chronic schizophrenia and increases in beliefs about dangerousness and unpredictability. Campaigns to improve mental health literacy and reduce stigmatising attitudes may have had beneficial effects in reducing the desire for social distance from those with mental disorders. However, increase in beliefs about the dangerousness and unpredictability of those with these disorders is of concern and points to the need for public education to address these aspects of stigma.

AB BACKGROUND: Environmental health research involving community participation has increased substantially since the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) environmental justice and community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnerships began in the mid-1990s. The goals of these partnerships are to inform and empower better decisions about exposures, foster trust, and generate scientific knowledge to reduce environmental health disparities in low-income, minority communities. Peer-reviewed publication and clinical health outcomes alone are inadequate criteria to judge the success of projects in meeting these goals; therefore, new strategies for evaluating success are needed.
   OBJECTIVES: We reviewed the methods used to evaluate our project, "Linking Breast Cancer Advocacy and Environmental Justice," to help identify successful CBPR methods and to assist other teams in documenting effectiveness. Although our project precedes the development of the NIEHS Evaluation Metrics Manual, a schema to evaluate the success of projects funded through the Partnerships in Environmental Public Health (PEPH), our work reported here illustrates the record keeping and self-reflection anticipated in NIEHS's PEPH.
   DISCUSSION: Evaluation strategies should assess how CBPR partnerships meet the goals of all partners. Our partnership, which included two strong community-based organizations, produced a team that helped all partners gain organizational capacity. Environmental sampling in homes and reporting the results of that effort had community education and constituency-building benefits. Scientific results contributed to a court decision that required cumulative impact assessment for an oil refinery and to new policies for chemicals used in consumer products. All partners leveraged additional funding to extend their work.
   CONCLUSIONS: An appropriate evaluation strategy can demonstrate how CBPR projects can advance science, support community empowerment, increase environmental health literacy, and generate individual and policy action to protect health.

AB Purpose: Despite the amount of health information available online, there are several barriers that limit the Internet from being adopted as a source of health information. The purpose of this study was to identify individual skill-related problems that users experience when accessing the Internet for health information and services.
   Methods: Between November 2009 and February 2010, 88 subjects participated in a performance test in which participants had to complete health-related assignments on the Internet. Subjects were randomly selected from a telephone book. A selective quota sample was used and was divided over equal subsamples of gender, age, and education. Each subject was required to complete nine assignments on the Internet.
   Results: The general population experiences many Internet skill-related problems, especially those related to information and strategic Internet skills. Aging and lower levels of education seemed to contribute to the amount of operational and formal skill-related problems experienced. Saving files, bookmarking websites, and using search engines were troublesome for these groups of people. With respect to information skills, the higher the level of educational attainment, the less problems the participants experienced. Although younger subjects experienced far less operational and formal skill-related problems, it was revealed that older subjects were less likely to select and use irrelevant search results and unreliable sources. Concerning the strategic Internet skills it was revealed that older subjects were less likely to make inappropriate decisions based on information gathered.
   Conclusions: The amount of online health-related information and services is consistently growing; however, it appears that the general population experiences many skill-related problems, particularly those related to information and strategic Internet skills, and they become very important when it comes to health. These skills are also problematic for younger generations who are often seen as skilled Internet users. The results of the study call for policies that account for low levels of Internet skills.

AB Background: The Internet is known to be used for health purposes by the general public all over the world. However, little is known about the use of, attitudes toward, and activities regarding eHealth among the Japanese population.
   Objectives: This study aimed to measure the prevalence of Internet use for health-related information compared with other sources, and to examine the effects on user knowledge, attitudes, and activities with regard to Internet use for health-related information in Japan. We examined the extent of use via personal computers and cell phones.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of a quasi-representative sample (N = 1200) of the Japanese general population aged 15-79 years in September 2007. The main outcome measures were (1) self-reported rates of Internet use in the past year to acquire health-related information and to contact health professionals, family, friends, and peers specifically for health-related purposes, and (2) perceived effects of Internet use on health care.
   Results: The prevalence of Internet use via personal computer for acquiring health-related information was 23.8% (286/1200) among those surveyed, whereas the prevalence via cell phone was 6% (77). Internet use via both personal computer and cell phone for communicating with health professionals, family, friends, or peers was not common. The Internet was used via personal computer for acquiring health-related information primarily by younger people, people with higher education levels, and people with higher household incomes. The majority of those who used the Internet for health care purposes responded that the Internet improved their knowledge or affected their lifestyle attitude, and that they felt confident in the health-related information they obtained from the Internet. However, less than one-quarter thought it improved their ability to manage their health or affected their health-related activities.
   Conclusions: Japanese moderately used the Internet via personal computers for health purposes, and rarely used the Internet via cell phones. Older people, people with lower education levels, and people with lower household incomes were less likely to access the Internet via cell phone. The Internet moderately improved users' health-related knowledge and attitudes but seldom changed their health-related abilities and activities. To encourage communication between health providers and consumers, it is important to improve eHealth literacy, especially in middle-aged people. It is also important to make adequate amendments to the reimbursement payment system and nationwide eHealth privacy and security framework, and to develop a collaborative relationship among industry, government, and academia.

AB The purpose of this systematic literature review was to describe the empirical findings on health literacy in adults 65 and older. A systematic search for research studies from 1999 to early 2010 was conducted in MEDLINE and CINAHL databases. Articles were analyzed using the following foci: skills and health knowledge, functional health literacy, and health behaviors and health outcomes. Findings indicated that advancing age resulted in a significant increase in prevalence of inadequate health literacy. Further research is needed to develop evidence-based, culturally congruent interventions to improve health literacy among older adults.

AB Study objective: We seek to determine how delirium and dementia affect the accuracy of the presenting illness and discharge instruction comprehension in older emergency department (ED) patients.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at an academic ED from May 2008 to July 2008 and included non-nursing home patients aged 65 years and older. Two open-ended interviews were performed to assess patients' ability to accurately provide their presenting illness and comprehension of their ED discharge instructions. The surrogates' version of the presenting illness and printed discharge instructions were the reference standards. Concordance between the patient and the reference standards was determined by 2 reviewers using a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (no concordance) to 5 (complete concordance). Proportional odds logistic regression was performed to determine whether cognitive impairment was associated with presenting complaint accuracy and discharge instruction comprehension. All models were adjusted for age, health literacy, education, nonwhite race, and hearing impairment.
   Results: For the presenting illness analysis, 202 patients participated. Compared with patients without cognitive impairment, those with delirium superimposed on dementia (DSD) had lower odds of agreeing with their surrogates with regard to why they were in the ED (adjusted proportional odds ratio=0.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.09 to 0.43). For the discharge instruction comprehension analysis, 115 patients participated. Patients with DSD had significantly lower odds of comprehending their discharge diagnosis (adjusted proportional odds ratio=0.13; 95% Cl 0.04 to 0.47), return to the ED instructions (adjusted proportional odds ratio=0.18; 95% Cl 0.04 to 0.82), and follow-up instructions (adjusted proportional odds ratio=0.09; 95% Cl 0.02 to 0.35) compared with patients without cognitive impairment.
   Conclusion: DSD is associated with decreased accuracy of the older patient's presenting illness and decreased comprehension of ED discharge instructions. [Ann Emerg Med. 2011;57:662-671.]

AB Background. The authors conducted a national survey to determine the communication techniques that dentists use routinely and variations in their use.
   Methods. American Dental Association Survey Center staff members mailed an 86-item questionnaire to a random sample of 6,300 U.S. dentists in private practice. Participants reported routine use ("most of the time" or "always") during a typical week of 18 communication techniques, of which seven are basic techniques. The authors used analysis of variance and ordinary least squares regression models to test the association of communication, provider and practice characteristics with the number of techniques.
   Results. Dentists routinely use an average of 7.1 of the 18 techniques and 3.1 of the seven basic techniques. Two-thirds or more of dentists used four of the techniques (hand out printed materials, speak slowly, use models or radiographs to explain, use simple language). Less than one-fourth of dentists used any of the techniques in the teach-back method or patient-friendly practice domains. A dentist's age, race/ethnicity, education outside the United States and area of dentistry affected use. Health literacy variables (awareness, education in communication, practice-level change, outcome expectancy) and lack of time were associated with the number of techniques used.
   Conclusions. Routine use of all of the communication techniques is low among dentists, including some techniques thought to be most effective with patients with low literacy skills.
   Practice Implications. Professional education is needed to improve knowledge about communication techniques and to ensure that they are used effectively. A firm foundation for these efforts requires the development, evaluation and dissemination of communication guidelines for dental care professionals.

AB Background: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) require self-management skills that may be influenced by self-efficacy (SE). Self-efficacy represents an individual's perception of his or her ability to organize and execute the behaviors necessary to manage disease. The goal of this study was to develop a valid and reliable measure of IBD-specific SE that can be used in clinical and research contexts.
   Methods: One hundred and twenty-two adults with a verified IBD diagnosis participated in the study. Data were pooled from 2 sources: patients from an outpatient university gastroenterology clinic (n = 42) and a sample of online respondents (n = 80). All participants (N = 122) completed the IBD Self-Efficacy Scale (IBD-SES) and the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire. Additionally, online participants completed the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, whereas those in the clinic sample completed the Perceived Health Competence Scale, the Perceived Stress Questionnaire, and the Short Form Version 2 Health Survey.
   Results: The IBD-SES was initially constructed to identify 4 distinct theoretical domains of self-efficacy: (1) managing stress and emotions, (2) managing medical care, (3) managing symptoms and disease, and (4) maintaining remission. The 29-item IBD-SES has high internal consistency (r = 0.96), high test-retest reliability (r = 0.90), and demonstrates strong construct and concurrent validity with established measures.
   Conclusions: The IBD-SES is a critical first step toward addressing an important psychological construct that could influence treatment outcomes in IBD.

AB Objective:
   Studies show that the average person fails to understand and use health care related materials to their full potential. The goal of this study was to evaluate a health literacy instrument based on the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) that incorporates dental and medical terms into one 84-item Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine and Dentistry (REALM-D) measure and determine its association with patient characteristics of a culturally diverse dental clinic population.
   Methods:
   An 84-item dental/medical health literacy word list and a 48-item health beliefs and attitudes survey was provided to a sample of 200 adult patients seeking treatment for the first time at an oral diagnosis clinic located in a large urban medical center in Los Angeles, California.
   Results:
   Of the total sample, 154 participants read all of list 1 correctly, 141 read list 2 correctly, and only 38 read list 3 correctly. Nonwhite participants had significantly lower REALM-D scores at each level of difficulty as well as the total scale score compared to white participants. Participants who reported English as not their main language had significantly lower REALM-D scores. REALM-D scores also varied significantly by level of education among participants where as level of education increased, oral health literacy increased. At a bivariate level, race, education, and English as a main language remain predictive of health literacy in a regression model. An interaction between education and English as a main language was significant.
   Conclusions:
   The REALM-D is an effective instrument for use by medical and dental clinicians in detecting differences among people of different backgrounds and for whom English was not their primary language.

AB Background
   Few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have examined potential preventive agents in high-risk community populations.
   Aims
   To determine whether a mental health literacy intervention, the promotion of physical activity, or folic acid plus vitamin B-12 reduce depression symptoms in community-dwelling older adults with elevated psychological distress.
   Method
   An RCT with a completely crossed 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design: (400 mcg/d folic acid + 100 mcg/d vitamin B-12 v. placebo) x (physical activity v. nutrition promotion control) x (mental health literacy v. pain information control). The initial target sample size was 2000: however, only 909 adults (60-74 years) met the study criteria. Interventions were delivered by mail with telephone calls. The main outcome was depressive symptoms on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at 6 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months. The Clinicaltrials.gov registration number is NCT00214682.
   Results
   The drop-out rate was low (13.5%) from randomisation to 24-month assessment. Neither folic acid + B-12 (F(3,856) = 0.83, P = 0.476) nor physical activity (F(3,856) = 1.65, P = 0.177) reduced depressive symptoms at any time point. At 6 weeks, depressive symptoms were lower for the mental health literacy intervention compared with its control condition (t(895) = 2.04, P = 0.042).
   Conclusions
   Mental health literacy had a transient effect on depressive symptoms. Other than this, none of the interventions significantly reduced symptoms relative to their comparator at 6 weeks or subsequently. Neither folic acid plus B-12 nor physical activity were effective in reducing depressive symptoms.

AB Objective: To test the relationship between child health literacy and body mass index (BMI) Z-score in overweight children.
   Methods: Cross-sectional survey of overweight children and parents. Parent and child health literacy was measured by the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy (STOFHLA). Linear regression tested for predictors of childhood BMI Z-score, adjusting for confounders.
   Results: Of 171 total children, 107 (62%) participated, of whom 78 (73%) had complete data for analysis. Mean child BMI Z-score (SD) was 2.3 (0.40); median child age (interquartile range) was 11.5 (10-16); 53% were female; 80% were Medicaid recipients. Mean child STOFHLA was 22.9 (9.0); mean parental STOFHLA was 29.1 (8.6). Child STOFHLA correlated negatively with BMI Z-score (r = 0.37, p = 0.0009) and positively with child eating self-efficacy (r = 0.40, p < 0.0001). After adjusting for confounders, child STOFHLA was independently associated with child BMI Z-score (standardized B = -0.43, p < 0.0001). Overall adjusted r-squared for the regression model was 38%. Child STOFHLA contributed 13% to the overall model.
   Conclusions: Child health literacy was negatively correlated with BMI Z-scores in overweight children, suggesting the need to consider health literacy in the intersection between self-efficacy and behavior change when planning interventions that aim to improve child BMI.

TI Improving Prescription Drug Warnings to Promote Patient Comprehension
SO ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID LABEL INSTRUCTIONS; HEALTH LITERACY; OLDER-ADULTS; MEDICATION
AB Background: Prior studies have documented a high prevalence of patients who misunderstand prescription drug warning labels, placing them at risk for medication error. We evaluated whether the use of "enhanced print" drug warnings could improve patient comprehension beyond a current standard.
   Methods: An evaluation of enhanced print warning labels was conducted at 2 academic and 2 community health primary care clinics in Chicago, Illinois, and Shreveport, Louisiana. In total, 500 adult patients were consecutively recruited and assigned to receive (1) current standard drug warning labels on prescription containers (standard), (2) drug warnings with text rewritten in plain language (simplified text), or (3) plain language and icons developed with patient feedback (simplified text + icon). The primary outcome was correct interpretation of 9 drug warning labels as determined by a blinded panel review of patients' verbatim responses.
   Results: Overall rates of correct interpretation of drug warnings varied among standard, simplified text, and simplified text + icon labels (80.3%, 90.6%, and 92.1%, respectively; P < .001). Warnings with simplified text and simplified text + icons were more likely to be correctly interpreted compared with standard labels (simplified text - adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.00-3.49; simplified text + icons-AOR = 3.26; 95% CI, 2.46-4.32). Patients' ability to correctly interpret labels was not significantly different with the inclusion of icons (simplified text + icons - AOR = 1.23; 95% CI, 0.90-1.67; P = .20). Low literacy was also an independent predictor of misinterpretation (AOR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44-0.94). Patients with marginal and low literacy were better able to correctly interpret warning labels with simplified text + icons compared with labels with simplified text only (marginal literacy - AOR = 2.59; 95% CI, 1.24-5.44; P = .01; low literacy - AOR = 3.22; 95% CI, 1.39-7.50; P = .006).
   Conclusions: Simple, explicit language on warning labels can increase patient understanding; the addition of appropriate icons is particularly useful for adults with lower literacy skills. Evidence-based standards are needed to promote patient-centered prescription labeling practices.

AB Context The use of written decision aids (DAs) in clinical practice has proliferated. However, few DAs have been developed for low literacy users, despite this group having low knowledge about healthcare and lacking involvement in health decisions.
   Objective To explore the information needs and understanding of adults with varying literacy in relation to colorectal cancer screening, and to consider their responses to two versions of a decision aid.
   Participants Thirty-three men and women aged 45-74 years were recruited from Adult Basic Education classes (n = 17) and University Continuing Education programs (n = 16).
   Methods We used qualitative methods (in-depth, semi-structured interviews) to compare and contrast the views of adults with lower and higher literacy levels, to gain a better understanding of how people with lower literacy value and interpret specific DA content and components; and determine whether needs and preferences are specific to lower literacy groups or generic across the broad literacy spectrum.
   Results Regardless of literacy perspective, participants' interpretations of the DA were shaped by their prior knowledge and expectations, as well as their values and preferences. This influenced perceptions of the DAs role in supporting informed decision making. A linguistic theoretical model was applied to interpret the findings. This facilitated considerations beyond the traditional focus on the readability of materials.
   Conclusion Decision aids developers may find it useful to apply alternative approaches (linguistic) when creating DAs for consumers of varying literacy.

ID FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY; READABILITY; INFORMATION; KNOWLEDGE;
   WRITTEN; SKILLS
AB Background and Objectives: A large proportion of US adults struggle with limited literacy skills, which affect their ability to fully function in health care settings. This study evaluated the readability of English language American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) patient education materials. Methods: A random sample of 171 AAFP patient education materials was selected from a list of 518 health topics available via the Internet. The SMOG grade formula was used to measure readability of the written patient education materials. Results: The mean SMOG grade level of AAFP patient education materials was 9.43 +/- 1.31 (range=6-12). This is higher than the average reading skills of US adults. Conclusions: Our results support and extend the findings of other readability studies across many medical specialties, all of which find that patient education materials are written at a difficulty level that is too high. The AAFP and individual family physicians should strive to improve communication with their patients by providing educational materials that are written at an appropriate reading level.

TI Effect of literacy on breast-feeding outcomes
SO SOUTHERN MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID PATIENT
AB Background. We studied the effect of functional health literacy on the initiation and continuance of breast-feeding in women at a public health clinic.
   Methods. Subjects were 61 first-time mothers aged 18 years or older who spoke English as their first language. They were divided into two groups, one who exclusively breast-fed for at least the first 2 months and one who never initiated breast-feeding or did not exclusively breast-feed for at least 2 months. The Rapid Estimate of adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) was administered, providing reading grade-level estimates for each subject.
   Results. An association between functional health literacy and breast-feeding was seen, with only 23% of the women in the lower literacy group exclusively breast-feeding during the first 2 months compared with 54% of women in the higher literacy group.
   Conclusion. Many patients need simpler health education materials encouraging breastfeeding. These materials are needed both before and during pregnancy.

TI Evidence on the effectiveness of health literacy interventions in the
   EU: a systematic review
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Review
DE Health literacy; Europe; Interventions; Review
ID CARE; EDUCATION; INFORMATION; PEOPLE; TRIAL
AB BackgroundIn the last decade, the attention for health literacy has increased in the European Union. This is due to three main reasons. First, reviews have shown that inadequate health literacy is associated with worse health outcomes, higher health care use and expenditure. Second, in all European countries the population is aging and the number of chronically ill people is rising. Improving health literacy in this group can offer greater opportunities to take an active part in society, be independent and improve quality of life. Third, since most research on health literacy has been conducted outside Europe and relatively little is known about the development of health literacy interventions and its effects on outcome measures in European countries. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the evidence on the effectiveness of health literacy interventions in the European Union published between 1995 and 2018.MethodsSearches have been performed in Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane library, PsychINFO, ERIC, Web of Science and SCOPUS for publications on health literacy intervention studies in European Union countries. Studies were included if the research was conducted in one or more Member States of the European Union, the publication described an intervention study, the intervention was aimed at health literacy, the publication described an outcome measure related to health literacy and the publication was written in English, French or German.ResultsA total of 23 studies were included. Three types of interventions were identified; aimed at improving health literacy, tailored to different health literacy levels and aimed at improving health outcomes in general that differentiated in effects for people with different health literacy levels. Most interventions identified in the review focus on the functional level of health literacy or numeracy. The strength of evidence from the European health literacy intervention studies was low and there was a huge heterogeneity in study design, measurement tools and outcomes measured.ConclusionsPromising interventions were tailored to the needs of patients, addressing functional, interactive and critical skills and use not difficult animated spoken text. Future research should focus on the development and assessment of such interventions and use stronger designs.

AB As genetics and genomics become part of mainstream Medicine, these advances have the potential to reduce or exacerbate health disparities. Gaps in effective communication (where all parties share the same meaning) are widely recognized as a major contributor to health disparities. The purpose of this study was to examine GC-patient communication in real time, to assess its effectiveness from the patient perspective, and then to pilot intervention strategies to improve the communication. We observed 64 English-, 35 Spanish- and 25 Chinese-speaking (n = 124) public hospital patients and 10 GCs in 170 GC appointments, and interviewed 49 patients who were offered testing using the audio recordings to stimulate recall and probe specific aspects of the communication. Data analyses were conducted using grounded theory methods and revealed a fundamental mismatch between the information provided by GCs and the information desired and meaningful to patients. Several components of the communication that contributed to this mismatch and often resulted in ineffective communication included: (1) too much information; (2) complex terminology and conceptually difficult presentation of information; (3) information perceived as not relevant by the patient; (4) unintentional inhibition of patient engagement and question-asking; (5) vague discussions of screening and prevention recommendations. Our findings indicate a need to transform the standard model of genetic counseling communication using evidence-based principles and strategies from other fields of Medicine. The high rates of limited health literacy in the US, increasing access of diverse populations to genetic services, and growing complexity of genetic information have created a perfect storm. If not directly addressed, this convergence is likely to exacerbate health disparities in the genomic age.

AB Objective: social inequalities in health are believed to arise in part because individuals make use of social and economic resources in order to improve survival. In recent years, health literacy has received increased attention as a factor that can help explain differences in health outcomes. However, examination of life course predictors of health literacy has been limited.
   life course data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study 1957-2011 were used to examine predictors of health literacy in old age (N = 2,122), using the Newest Vital Sign. Generalised structural equation modelling was used to model pathways to health literacy.
   predictors of health literacy included educational attainment, and adolescent cognitive and non-cognitive skills, and, in men, rate of cognitive decline from middle to later life.
   numerous studies have documented health literacy issues among older adults, and recommendations have been made for ways to improve health literacy for this population. This study reports on risk factors across the life course that are associated with health literacy later in life, identifying possible intervention targets to reduce risk of poor health as people age. Our results suggest that a range of life course factors, beginning in early life, predict health literacy. Further research studying health literacy over the life course is warranted.

AB Purpose: Health literacy has been attracting increasing attention because low health literacy is considered an important predictor of adverse health outcomes in many chronic conditions, including diabetes. However, it is unclear how health literacy is associated with health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to formulate a hypothetical structural equation model linking health literacy to self-efficacy, self-care activities, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with type 2 diabetes.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey design was employed, and 459 patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited from outpatient clinics in two university hospitals. The patients completed a pack of questionnaires. The hypothetical model was tested using structural equation modeling analysis.
   Results: The values of multiple fit indices indicated that the proposed model provided a good fit to the data. Health literacy exerted not only a direct effect on self-care activities, but also an indirect effect on self-care activities via self-efficacy. However, health literacy exerted only an indirect effect on HRQOL. This structural model was invariant across hemoglobin-A1c-controlled and hemoglobin-A1c-uncontrolled groups. Based on R-2 values, the final model accounted for 20.0% of the variance in self-efficacy, 61.0% of the variance in self-care activities, and 16.0% of the variance in HRQOL.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that self-care activities are crucial to the link between health literacy and HRQOL. Both health literacy and self-efficacy need to be considered in clinical practice for enhancing self-care activities in patients with type 2 diabetes. This approach may ultimately improve HRQOL in these patients. Copyright (C) 2016, Korean Society of Nursing Science. Published by Elsevier.

AB Background Age and race-related disparities in technology use have been well documented, but less is known about how health literacy influences technology access and use.
   Objective To assess the association between patients' literacy skills and mobile phone ownership, use of text messaging, Internet access, and use of the Internet for health-related purposes.
   Methods A secondary analysis utilizing data from 1077 primary care patients enrolled in two, multisite studies from 2011-2013. Patients were administered an in-person, structured interview.
   Results Patients with adequate health literacy were more likely to own a mobile phone or smartphone in comparison with patients having marginal or low literacy (mobile phone ownership: 96.8 vs. 95.2 vs. 90.1%, respectively, P < 0.001; smartphone ownership: 70.6 vs. 62.5 vs. 40.1%, P < 0.001) and to report text messaging (78.6 vs. 75.2 vs. 53.1%, P < 0.001). They were also more likely to have access to the Internet from their home (92.1 vs. 74.7 vs. 44.9%, P < 0.001) and to report using the Internet for email (93.0 vs. 75.7 vs. 38.5%, P < 0.001), browsing the web (93.9 vs. 80.2 vs. 44.5%, P < 0.001), accessing health information (86.3 vs. 75.5 vs. 40.8%, P < 0.001), and communicating with providers (54.2 vs. 29.8 vs. 13.0%, P < 0.001). Relationships remained significant in multivariable analyses controlling for relevant covariates.
   Conclusions Results reveal that literacy-related disparities in technology access and use are widespread, with lower literate patients being less likely to own smartphones or to access and use the Internet, particularly for health reasons. Future interventions should consider these disparities and ensure that health promotion activities do not further exacerbate disparities.

TI Different Measures, Different Outcomes? A Systematic Review of
   Performance-Based versus Self-Reported Measures of Health Literacy and

AB Health literacy (HL) and numeracy are measured by one of two methods: performance on objective tests or self-report of one's skills. Whether results from these methods differ in their relationship to health outcomes or use of health services is unknown.
   We performed a systematic review to identify and evaluate articles that measured both performance-based and self-reported HL or numeracy and examined their relationship to health outcomes or health service use. To identify studies, we started with an AHRQ-funded systematic review of HL and health outcomes. We then looked for newer studies by searching MEDLINE from 1 February 2010 to 9 December 2014. We included English language studies meeting pre-specified criteria. Two reviewers independently assessed abstracts and studies for inclusion and graded study quality. One reviewer abstracted information from included studies while a second checked content for accuracy.
   We identified four "fair" quality studies that met inclusion criteria for our review. Two studies measuring HL found no differences between performance-based and self-reported HL for association with self-reported outcomes (including diabetes, stroke, hypertension) or a physician-completed rheumatoid arthritis disease activity score. However, HL measures were differentially related to a patient-completed health assessment questionnaire and to a patient's ability to interpret their prescription medication name and dose from a medication bottle. Only one study measured numeracy and found no difference between performance-based and self-reported measures of numeracy and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening utilization. However, in a moderator analysis from the same study, performance-based and self-reported numeracy were differentially related to CRC screening utilization when stratified by certain patient-provider communication behaviors (e.g., the chance to always ask questions and get the support that is needed).
   Most studies found no difference in the relationship between results of performance-based and self-reported measures and outcomes. However, we identified few studies using multiple instruments and/or objective outcomes.

AB Review of the evidence on patient-centred care (PCC) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) shows that involving the patient as an individual - with unique needs, concerns and preferences - has a relevant impact on treatment outcomes (safety, effectiveness and costs). This approach empowers patients to take personal responsibility for their treatment.
   Because clinicians are only able to interact personally with their patients just a few hours per year, patients with a chronic condition such as RA should be actively involved in the management of their disease. To stimulate this active role, five different PCC activities can be distinguished: (I) patient education, (2) patient involvement/shared decision-making, (3) patient empowerment/self-management, (4) involvement of family and friends and (5) physical and emotional support. This article reviews the existing knowledge on these five PCC activities in the context of established RA management, especially focused on opportunities to increase medication adherence in established RA.

AB PurposeEvidence indicates that research participants often do not fully understand the studies for which they have volunteered. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the relationship between the process of obtaining informed consent for research and participant comprehension and satisfaction with the research.
   DesignSystematic review of published research on informed consent and participant comprehension of research for which they volunteer using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Statement as a guide.
   MethodsPubMed, Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trails, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were used to search the literature for studies meeting the following inclusion criteria: (a) published between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2013, (b) interventional or descriptive quantitative design, (c) published in a peer-reviewed journal, (d) written in English, and (e) assessed participant comprehension or satisfaction with the research process. Studies were assessed for quality using seven indicators: sampling method, use of controls or comparison groups, response rate, description of intervention, description of outcome, statistical method, and health literacy assessment.
   FindingsOf 176 studies identified, 27 met inclusion criteria: 13 (48%) were randomized interventional designs and 14 (52%) were descriptive. Three categories of studies included projects assessing (a) enhanced consent process or form, (b) multimedia methods, and (c) education to improve participant understanding. Most (78%) used investigator-developed tools to assess participant comprehension, did not assess participant health literacy (74%), or did not assess the readability level of the consent form (89%). Researchers found participants lacked basic understanding of research elements: randomization, placebo, risks, and therapeutic misconception.
   ConclusionsFindings indicate (a) inconsistent assessment of participant reading or health literacy level, (b) measurement variation associated with use of nonstandardized tools, and (c) continued therapeutic misconception and lack of understanding among research participants of randomization, placebo, benefit, and risk. While the Agency for Healthcare and Quality and National Quality Forum have published informed consent and authorization toolkits, previously published validated tools are underutilized.
   Clinical RelevanceInformed consent requires the assessment of health literacy, reading level, and comprehension of research participants using validated assessment tools and methods.

AB Purpose: To summarize key issues in the eHealth field from an implementation science perspective and to highlight illustrative processes, examples and key directions to help more rapidly integrate research, policy and practice.
   Methods: We present background on implementation science models and emerging principles; discuss implications for eHealth research; provide examples of practical designs, measures and exemplar studies that address key implementation science issues; and make recommendations for ways to more rapidly develop and test eHealth interventions as well as future research, policy and practice.
   Results: The pace of eHealth research has generally not kept up with technological advances, and many of our designs, methods and funding mechanisms are incapable of providing the types of rapid and relevant information needed. Although there has been substantial eHealth research conducted with positive short-term results, several key implementation and dissemination issues such as representativeness, cost, unintended consequences, impact on health inequities, and sustainability have not been addressed or reported. Examples of studies in several of these areas are summarized to demonstrate this is possible.
   Conclusions: eHealth research that is intended to translate into policy and practice should be more contextual, report more on setting factors, employ more responsive and pragmatic designs and report results more transparently on issues important to potential adopting patients, clinicians and organizational decision makers. We outline an alternative development and assessment model, summarize implementation science findings that can help focus attention, and call for different types of more rapid and relevant research and funding mechanisms.

AB ObjectivesTo examine self-management behaviors, including medication adherence and inhaler technique, in older adults with asthma and their association with health literacy.
   DesignObservational cohort study.
   SettingPrimary care and pulmonary specialty practices in two tertiary academic medical centers and three federally qualified health centers in New York, New York, and Chicago, Illinois.
   ParticipantsAdults with moderate or severe persistent asthma aged 60 and older (N=433).
   MeasurementsOutcomes were adherence to asthma controller medications, metered dose inhaler (MDI) and dry powder inhaler (DPI) techniques, having a usual asthma physician, and avoidance of four common triggers. Health literacy was assessed using the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults.
   ResultsThe mean age was 67, and 36% of participants had marginal or low health literacy. Adherence was low (38%) overall and worse in individuals with low health literacy (22%) than in those with adequate literacy (47%, P<.001) and after adjusting for demographic factors and health status (odds ratio (OR)=0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.31-0.73). Similarly, inhaler technique was poor; only 38% and 54% had good MDI and DPI technique, respectively. Technique was worse in those with low health literacy (MDI technique: OR=0.57, 95% CI=0.38-0.85; DPI technique: OR=0.42, 95% CI=0.25-0.71). Asthma self-monitoring and avoidance of triggers occurred infrequently but were less consistently associated with low health literacy.
   ConclusionAdherence to medications and inhaler technique are poor in older adults with asthma and worse in those with low health literacy. Clinicians should routinely assess controller medication adherence and inhaler technique and use low-literacy communication strategies to support self-management in older adults with asthma.

AB OBJECTIVE. Health consumers and their families rely on the Internet as a source of authoritative information regarding the procedures used to reach a diagnosis, effect treatment, and influence prognosis. In radiology, online materials can be a means by which to offer patients comprehensible explanations of the capabilities, the risks and rewards, and the techniques under our purview. Consequently, estimations of health literacy should take into account the reading level of the average American when composing and transmitting such information to the lay public without the mediation of a referring physician.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS. In December 2012, patient education reports from the files of RadiologyInfo. org, a jointly sponsored website of the American College of Radiology and the Radiological Society of North America, were downloaded to assess their textual sophistication. All 138 patient education articles including the glossary were analyzed for their respective level of " readability" using the following 10 evaluative scales: Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Simple Measure of Gobbledygook Grading, ColemanLiau Index, Gunning Fog Index, New Dale-Chall scale, FORCAST, Fry graph, Raygor Readability Estimate, and New Fog Count.
   RESULTS. The 138 online patient education articles were written, on average, between the 10th and 14th grade levels, which exceeds both the American Medical Association and the National Institutes of Health recommendations that patient education resources be comprehensible to those who read no higher than the seventh grade level.
   CONCLUSION. Patients may accrue a greater benefit from written articles available on RadiologyInfo. org if the texts were revised to be in compliance with the National Institutes of Health and American Medical Association grade level recommendations. This could lead to a broadened appreciation of the capabilities of radiology's role in general and enhanced understanding of imaging techniques and their application to clinical practice.

AB Background: In order to improve help seeking by young people for mental illness, a better understanding is required of their help-seeking intentions and barriers to their help seeking from various different sources and for different disorders.
   Methods: Young people's help-seeking intentions and perceived barriers to help seeking were assessed by a national telephone survey of 3021 youths aged 15-25 years. Respondents were presented with a vignette of a young person portraying depression, depression with suicidal thoughts, depression with alcohol abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder, social phobia, or psychosis.
   Results: Embarrassment or shyness was the most frequently mentioned barrier to seeking help from most sources. However, different barriers featured prominently depending on the disorder and the helper. Age, sex, and knowing a family member or friend who had received professional help for mental illness predicted some barriers.
   Limitations: Help-seeking intentions and barriers were assessed with reference to a vignette character and may not reflect actual experience or behaviors.
   Conclusions: Findings can facilitate the targeting of future efforts to improve young people's help seeking for mental disorders by highlighting the barriers that are more relevant for specific disorders, sources of help and personal characteristics. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVE: Recognition of the complexity of asthma management has led to the development of asthma treatment guidelines that include the recommendation that all pediatric asthma patients receive a written asthma action plan. We assessed the readability, suitability, and characteristics of asthma action plans, elements that contribute to the effectiveness of action plan use, particularly for those with limited literacy.
   METHODS: This was a descriptive study of 30 asthma action plans (27 state Department of Health (DOH)-endorsed, 3 national action plans endorsed by 6 states). Outcome measures: (1) readability (as assessed by Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog, Simple Measure of Gobbledygook, Forcast), (2) suitability (Suitability Assessment of Materials [SAM], adequate: >= 0.4; unsuitable: <0.4), (3) action plan characteristics (peak flow vs symptom-based, symptoms, recommended actions).
   RESULTS: Mean (SD) overall readability grade level was 7.2 (1.1) (range = 5.7-9.8); 70.0% were above a sixth-grade level. Mean (SD) suitability score was 0.74 (0.14). Overall, all action plans were found to be adequate, although 40.0% had an unsuitable score in at least 1 factor. The highest percent of unsuitable scores were found in the categories of layout/typography (30.0%), learning stimulation/motivation (26.7%), and graphics (13.3%). There were no statistically significant differences between the average grade level or SAM score of state DOH developed action plans and those from or adapted from national organizations. Plans varied with respect to terms used, symptoms included, and recommended actions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Specific improvements in asthma action plans could maximize patient and parent understanding of appropriate asthma management and could particularly benefit individuals with limited literacy skills. Pediatrics 2013;131:e116-e126

AB Objective: To pilot test the Text Reminders for Immunization Compliance in Kids (TRICKs) program to evaluate its feasibility and potential to increase immunization coverage.
   Design: Randomized controlled trial (RCT).
   Setting: Pediatric clinic.
   Participants: Parents of newborns being discharged from a local hospital who intended to seek child health care at the University-sponsored pediatric resident and faculty clinic.
   Intervention: Text message immunization reminders prior to immunization due dates.
   Main Outcome Measures: Receipt and timeliness of immunizations at 2,4 and 6 months of age.
   Results: Participants (N = 90) were English (83%) or Spanish (17%) speaking. The majority were female (83%), on public insurance (59%), and had adequate health literacy (96%). Parents were married or a member of an unmarried couple (62%). Over 66% had a high school diploma or less. Greater numbers of intervention children received immunizations and were "on time" using per protocol analysis: though not statistically significance. Limitations include sample size, problematic text messaging software, and loss of phone service at 7 months for 40% of intervention parents. However, post-intervention interviews (N = 18) indicated strong support for TRICKs; 83% found the text message reminders very helpful and 17% somewhat helpful.
   Discussion: Pilot testing allowed us to assess processes, including recruitment, retention, and software, which will increase the success of an RCT. Software with built-in backup systems is needed for follow-up when mobile service is interrupted. However, in spite of limitations, immunization rates were higher in the text message reminder group, though not statistically significant. Parent support and interest was high. A fully powered RCT is needed with follow-up over the full 4-3-1-3-3-1 series. Based on our results, for 80% power where we expected 90% compliance in the intervention group and 80% in the control group we need 219 per group, plus increases to address drop out and loss of follow-up.

AB OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a short health literacy assessment tool for Portuguese-speaking adults.
   METHODS: The Short Assessment of Health Literacy for Portuguese-speaking Adults is an assessment tool which consists of 50 items that assess an individual's ability to correctly pronounce and understand common medical terms. We evaluated the instrument's psychometric properties in a convenience sample of 226 Brazilian older adults. Construct validity was assessed by correlating the tool scores with years of schooling, self-reported literacy, and global cognitive functioning. Discrimination validity was assessed by testing the tool's accuracy in detecting inadequate health literacy, defined as failure to fully understand standard medical prescriptions.
   RESULTS: Moderate to high correlations were found in the assessment of construct validity (Spearman's coefficients ranging from 0.63 to 0.76). The instrument showed adequate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.93) and adequate test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.95). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for detection of inadequate health literacy was 0.82. A version consisting of 18 items was tested and showed similar psychometric properties.
   CONCLUSIONS: The instrument developed showed good validity and reliability in a sample of Brazilian older adults. It can be used in research and clinical settings for screening inadequate health literacy.

TI Developing and evaluating a relevant and feasible instrument for

ID ADOLESCENTS; FUTURE
AB Health literacy has come to play a critical role in health education and promotion, yet it is poorly understood in adolescents and few measurement tools exist. Standardized instruments to measure health literacy in adults assume it to be a derivative of general literacy. This paper reports on the development and the early-stage validation of a health literacy tool for high school students that measured skills to understand and evaluate health information. A systematic process was used to develop, score and validate items. Questionnaire data were collected from 275, primarily 10th grade students in three secondary schools in Vancouver, Canada that reflected variation in demographic profile. Forty-eight percent were male, and 69.1% spoke a language other than English. Bivariate correlations between background variables and the domain and overall health literacy scores were calculated. A regression model was developed using 15 explanatory variables. The R-2 value was 0.567. Key findings were that lower scores were achieved by males, students speaking a second language other than English, those who immigrated to Canada at a later age and those who skipped school more often. Unlike in general literacy where the family factors of mother's education and family affluence both played significant roles, these two factors failed to predict the health literacy of our school-aged sample. The most significant contributions of this work include the creation of an instrument for measuring adolescent health literacy and further emphasizing the distinction between health literacy and general literacy.

TI Discharge information needs of patients after surgery
SO JOURNAL OF WOUND OSTOMY AND CONTINENCE NURSING
LA English
DT Article
ID POSTOPERATIVE PAIN; AFTER-DISCHARGE; HEALTH LITERACY; OLDER-ADULTS;
   IMPACT; RECOVERY; CANCER
AB Patients who have undergone surgical procedures often have self-care concerns in their preparation for discharge from the hospital. This article examines the research literature about information needs of postoperative patients prior to their discharge. The most common concerns were the incision/wound care, pain management, activity level, monitoring for complications, symptom management, elimination, and quality of life. Because of their clinical knowledge of the perioperative experience, wound, ostomy, and continence nurses and other advanced practice nurses have a critical role in the development of discharge-educational programs for postoperative patients and caregivers. Because unmet discharge needs can contribute to poor patient outcomes and readmission, it is critical that wound, ostomy, and continence nurses, advanced practice nurses, and clinical staff nurses accurately identify patients' informational needs and find ways to meet these needs especially with the aging population, new/advanced surgical procedures, vulnerability/poverty, and literacy level of patients.

AB PURPOSE his research was conducted to develop a valid, reliable, quick, and nonstigmatizing tool for assessing literacy in the healthcare setting.
   METHODS The Literacy Assessment for Diabetes (LAD) instrument was developed as a word recognition test composed of 3 graded word lists in ascending difficulty. This literacy test, which was specific to diabetes, measured a patient's ability to pronounce terms that they would encounter during clinic visits and in reading menu and self-care instructions. The majority of the terms were on a 4th-grade reading level, with the remaining words ranging from the 6th- through 16th-grade levels. To assess reliability and validity, the LAD was compared with the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT3) and the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) by administering all 3 tests to 203 participants in a test-retest study design.
   RESULTS All 3 tests (LAD, REALM, and WRAT3) reliably detected true intrasubject variation in word recognition from test to retest. In addition, LAD measured word recognition ability similar to the REALM and WRAT3.
   CONCLUSIONS The LAD is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring literacy in adults with diabetes. It can be administered in 3 minutes or less, and the raw score is scaled to a reading grade level.

AB Background. Limited health literacy affects 25% of people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and may reduce self-management skills resulting in poorer clinical outcomes. By disproportionately affecting people with low socio-economic status and non-white ethnicity, limited health literacy may promote health inequity.
   Methods. We performed a systematic review of quantitative studies of health literacy and clinical outcomes among adults with CKD.
   Results. A total of 29 studies (13 articles; 16 conference abstracts) were included. One included non-USA patients. Of the 29 studies, 5 were cohort studies and 24 were cross-sectional. In all, 18 300 patients were studied: 4367 non-dialysis CKD; 13 202 dialysis; 390 transplant; 341 unspecified. Median study size was 127 [interquartile range (IQR) 92-238)], but 480 (IQR 260-2392) for cohort studies. Median proportion of non-white participants was 48% (IQR 17-70%). Six health literacy measures were used. Outcomes included patient attributes, care processes, clinical/laboratory parameters and 'hard' clinical outcomes. Limited health literacy was significantly, independently associated with hospitalizations, emergency department use, missed dialysis sessions, cardiovascular events and mortality (in cohort studies). Study quality was high (1 study), moderate (3 studies) and poor (25 studies), limited by sampling methods, variable adjustment for confounders and reduced methodological detail given in conference abstracts.
   Conclusions. There is limited robust evidence of the causal effects of health literacy on patient outcomes in CKD. Available evidence suggests associations with adverse clinical events, increased healthcare use and mortality. Prospective studies are required to determine the causal effects of health literacy on outcomes in CKD patients, and examine the relationships between socio-economic status, comorbidity, health literacy and CKD outcomes. Intervention development and evaluation will determine whether health literacy is a modifiable determinant of poor outcomes in CKD.

TI Tokenism in patient engagement
SO FAMILY PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
DE Culture and disease/cross-cultural issues; doctor-patient relationship;
   faculty development; health literacy; primary care
AB Background. Patient engagement throughout research is a way to generate more relevant patient-important research questions, methods and results with the ultimate aim of facilitating translation of research into practice. Tokenism is defined as the practice of making perfunctory or symbolic efforts to engage communities or patients.
   Objective. We wanted to explore how tokenism might influence engaging patients in research to help researchers work towards more genuine engagement.
   Methods. The Community Clinician Advisory Group and Patient and Clinician Engagement program held a workshop at the 2015 North American Primary Care Research Group meeting titled 'How Do We Move beyond Tokenism in Patient Engagement?' Patients, clinicians and academic researchers contributed examples of genuine and token engagement characteristics based on personal experience and knowledge. Data were iteratively collated and categorized into domains and items.
   Results. Examples of genuine and token engagement were categorized into three domains: Methods/Structure of engagement, Intent and Relationship building. Members with experience in patient-engaged research projects felt that longitudinal engagement was a key element to effectively translating research into local community and practice.
   Conclusions. The group (i) highly valued genuine intent and relationship building as elements to combat tokenism; (ii) noted that early genuine attempts at engagement may superficially resemble tokenism as researchers build enduring and trusting relationships with patient/community partners and (iii) emphasized the importance of seeking and utilizing patient experiences throughout research. These observations may contribute to more formal methods to help researchers (and reviewers) evaluate where engagement processes sit along the 'genuine-token' continuum.

DT Article
DE Health literacy; Hospitalisation; Equity; Access
ID INCREASING RESPONSE RATES; MEDICARE ENROLLEES; CARE; RISK
AB Background: Health literacy is simply defined as an individual's ability to access, understand and use information in ways that promote and maintain good health. Lower health literacy has been found to be associated with increased emergency department presentations and potentially avoidable hospitalisations. This study aimed to determine the health literacy of hospital inpatients, and to examine if associations exist between different dimensions of their health literacy, sociodemographic characteristics and hospital services use.
   Methods: A written survey was sent to 3,252 people aged >= 18 years in English, Arabic, Chinese, Vietnamese, Italian or Greek. The survey included demographic and health questions, and the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ). The HLQ is a multidimensional instrument comprising nine independent scales. Use of hospital services was measured by length of stay, number of admissions in 12 months and number of emergency department presentations. Effect size (ES) for standardised differences in means described the magnitude of differences in HLQ scale scores between demographic and socioeconomic groups.
   Results: 385 questionnaires were returned (13%); mean age 64 years (SD 17), 49% female. Aged >= 65 years (55%), using the Internet < once a month (37%), failure to complete high school (67%), low household income (39%), receiving means-tested government benefits (61%) and being from a culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) background (24%), were all associated with lower scores in some health literacy scales. Being aged >= 65 years, not currently employed, receiving government benefits, and being from a CALD background were also associated with increased use of some hospital services. There was no association between lower scores on any HLQ scale and greater use of hospital services.
   Conclusion: We found no association between lower health literacy and greater use of hospital health services. However increased age, having a CALD background and not speaking English at home were all associated with having the most health literacy challenges Strategies to address these are needed to reduce health inequalities.

AB Background: Limited evidence exists regarding the relationship between health literacy and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in Australian patients from primary care. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of health literacy on HRQoL in a large sample of patients without known vascular disease or diabetes and to examine whether the difference in HRQoL between low and high health literacy groups was clinically significant.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of baseline data from a cluster randomised trial. The study included 739 patients from 30 general practices across four Australian states conducted in 2012 and 2013 using the standard Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) version 2. SF-12 physical component score (PCS-12) and mental component score (MCS-12) are derived using the standard US algorithm. Health literacy was measured using the Health Literacy Management Scale (HeLMS). Multilevel regression analysis (patients at level 1 and general practices at level 2) was applied to relate PCS-12 and MCS-12 to patient reported life style risk behaviours including health literacy and demographic factors.
   Results: Low health literacy patients were more likely to be smokers (12 % vs 6 %, P = 0.005), do insufficient physical activity (63 % vs 47 %, P < 0.001), be overweight (68 % vs 52 %, P < 0.001), and have lower physical health and lower mental health with large clinically significant effect sizes of 0.56 (B (regression coefficient) = -5.4, P < 0.001) and 0.78(B = -6.4, P < 0.001) respectively after adjustment for confounding factors. Patients with insufficient physical activity were likely to have a lower physical health score (effect size = 0.42, B = -3.1, P < 0.001) and lower mental health (effect size = 0.37, B = -2.6, P < 0.001). Being overweight tended to be related to a lower PCS-12 (effect size = 0.41, B = -1.8, P < 0.05). Less well-educated, unemployed and smoking patients with low health literacy reported worse physical health. Health literacy accounted for 45 and 70 % of the total between patient variance explained in PCS-12 and MCS-12 respectively.
   Conclusions: Addressing health literacy related barriers to preventive care may help reduce some of the disparities in HRQoL. Recognising and tailoring health related communication to those with low health literacy may improve health outcomes including HRQoL in general practice.

TI Should We Be Afraid of Simple Messages? The Effects of Text Difficulty

AB It is often recommended that health information should be simplified for people with low health literacy. However, little is known about whether messages adapted to low health literacy audiences are also effective for people with high health literacy, or whether simple messages are counterproductive in this group. Using a two (illustrated vs. text-only) by two (nondifficult vs. difficult text) between-subjects design, we test whether older adults with low (n = 279) versus high health literacy (n = 280) respond differently to colorectal cancer screening messages. Results showed that both health literacy groups recalled information best when the text was nondifficult. Reduced text difficulty did not lead to negative attitudes or less intention to have screening among people with high health literacy. Benefits of illustrations, in terms of improved recall and attitudes, were only found in people with low health literacy who were exposed to difficult texts. This was not found for people with high health literacy. In terms of informed decisions, nondifficult and illustrated messages resulted in the best informed decisions in the low health literacy group, whereas the high health literacy group benefited from nondifficult text in general, regardless of illustrations. Our findings imply that materials adapted to lower health literacy groups can also be used for a more general audience, as they do not deter people with high health literacy.

TI Numeracy and Literacy Independently Predict Patients' Ability to

AB Background: Increasing numbers of patients have direct access to laboratory test results outside of clinical consultations. This offers increased opportunities for both self-management of chronic conditions and advance preparation for clinic visits if patients are able to identify test results that are outside the reference ranges.
   Objective: Our objective was to assess whether adults can identify laboratory blood test values outside reference ranges when presented in a format similar to some current patient portals implemented within electronic health record (EHR) systems.
   Methods: In an Internet-administered survey, adults aged 40-70 years, approximately half with diabetes, were asked to imagine that they had type 2 diabetes. They were shown laboratory test results displayed in a standard tabular format. We randomized hemoglobin A(1c) values to be slightly (7.1%) or moderately (8.4%) outside the reference range and randomized other test results to be within or outside their reference ranges (ie, multiple deviations). We assessed (1) whether respondents identified the hemoglobin A(1c) level as outside the reference range, (2) how respondents rated glycemic control, and (3) whether they would call their doctor. We also measured numeracy and health literacy.
   Results: Among the 1817 adult participants, viewing test results with multiple deviations increased the probability of identifying hemoglobin A(1c) values as outside the reference range (participants with diabetes: OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.12-1.92, P=.005; participants without diabetes: OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.13-2.00, P=.005). Both numeracy and health literacy were significant predictors of correctly identifying out-of-range values. For participants with diabetes, numeracy OR 1.32 per unit on a 1-6 scale (95% CI 1.15-1.51, P<.001) and literacy OR 1.59 per unit of a 1-5 scale (95% CI 1.35-1.87, P<.001); for participants without diabetes, numeracy OR 1.36 per unit (95% CI 1.17-1.58, P<.001) and literacy OR 1.33 per unit (95% CI 1.12-1.58, P=.001). Predicted probabilities suggested 77% of higher numeracy and health literacy participants, but only 38% of lower numeracy and literacy participants, could correctly identify the hemoglobin A(1c) levels as outside the reference range. Correct identification reduced perceived blood glucose control (mean difference 1.68-1.71 points on a 0-10 scale, P<.001). For participants with diabetes, increased health literacy reduced the likelihood of calling one's doctor when hemoglobin A(1c)=7.1% (OR 0.66 per unit, 95% CI 0.52-0.82, P<.001) and increased numeracy increased intention to call when hemoglobin A(1c)= 8.4% (OR 1.36 per unit, 95% CI 1.10-1.69, P=.005).
   Conclusions: Limited health literacy and numeracy skills are significant barriers to basic use of laboratory test result data as currently presented in some EHR portals. Regarding contacting their doctor, less numerate and literate participants with diabetes appear insensitive to the hemoglobin A(1c) level shown, whereas highly numerate and literate participants with diabetes appear very sensitive. Alternate approaches appear necessary to make test results more meaningful.

AB Objective: This study examined the effect of self-efficacy on glycemic control, self-care behaviors, and quality of life in low-income, minority adults with diabetes.
   Methods: Data on 378 participants were examined. Multiple linear regression assessed associations between self-efficacy, hemoglobin A1c, medication adherence, diabetes knowledge, self-care behaviors and quality of life.
   Results: Self-efficacy had modest correlations with glycemic control (r = -2.250, P < .001), medication adherence (r = -.352, P < .001), diabetes knowledge (r = -.118, P < .039), diet (r = -.420, P < .001), exercise (r = -.220, P < .001), blood sugar testing (r = -.213, P < .001), foot care (r = .121, P < .032), and mental health related quality of life (r = .137, P < .017). In the regression model, self-efficacy was significantly associated with glycemic control (beta = -.104, 95% CI: - .157, - .051), medication adherence (beta = -.067, 95% CI: - .090, - .044), diet (beta = .150, 95% CI:.108,.191), exercise (beta = -.113, 95% CI:.065,.161), blood sugar testing (beta = .107, 95% CI:.049,.164) and mental health related quality of life (beta = .112, 95% CI:.051,.173).
   Conclusion: Higher self-efficacy was associated with improved glycemic control, medication adherence, self-care behavior and mental health related quality of life.
   Practice Implications: Emphasis on self-efficacy is relevant for educational interventions developed for low-income, minority populations.

AB Text4baby was launched in 2010 to promote healthy pregnancies and babies by the use of text messaging. The primary objective of this study was to assess factors related to the enrollment process and reception of text4baby. A prospective cohort study was conducted in two Women, Infant and Children clinics in Atlanta (April 2010-July 2011). Randomly selected pregnant and postpartum women (n = 468) were queried on cell phone use and instructed on text4baby enrollment. Self-enrollment issues were assessed at one-week follow-up (n = 351, 75.0 %), and message reception and reading patterns at two-month follow-up (n = 209, 44.7 %). Forty-two percent of the women had some college education and 82 % had household income <=$20,000. About half attempted text4baby self-enrollment (162/351), with enrollment success more likely among women with more education (80 % with some college vs. 62 % with less education), with household income above $10,000 (61 % < $10,000 vs. 83 % $10,001-$20,000 and 76 % > $20,000), and among women living in smaller households (77 % 1-3 members vs. 58 % > 3 members) (all p < 0.001). Among the 209 participants in the final follow-up contact, > 90 % reported uninterrupted reception and regular reading of messages, and 88 % planned to continue using text4baby. Results also suggested that respondents who were younger (< 26 year), less educated and had lower health literacy skills were more likely to have interrupted messages. Despite substantial interest in the text4baby program in an underserved population, innovative ways to help women with significant disadvantages enroll and receive uninterrupted messages are needed.

AB Studies reveal high levels of inadequate health literacy and numeracy in African Americans and older veterans. The authors aimed to investigate the distribution of health literacy, numeracy, and graph literacy in these populations. They conducted a cross-sectional survey of veterans receiving outpatient care and measured health literacy, numeracy, graph literacy, shared decision making, and trust in physicians. In addition, the authors compared subgroups of veterans using analyses of covariance. Participants were 502 veterans (22-82 years). Low, marginal, and adequate health literacy were found in, respectively, 29%, 26%, and 45% of the veterans. The authors found a significant main effect of race qualified by an age and race interaction. Inadequate health literacy was more common in African Americans than in Whites. Younger African Americans had lower health literacy (p <.001), graph literacy (p <.001), and numeracy (p <.001) than did Whites, even after the authors adjusted for covariates. Older and younger participants did not differ in health literacy, objective numeracy, or graph literacy after adjustment. The authors found no health literacy or age-related differences regarding preferences for shared decision making. African Americans expressed dissatisfaction with their current role in decision making (p =.03). Older participants trusted their physicians more than younger participants (p =.01). In conclusion, African Americans may be at a disadvantage when reviewing patient education materials, potentially affecting health care outcomes.

AB Purpose: Several literature reviews have been published summarizing objective knowledge about older patients with heart failure (HF). Although of vital importance to the treatment and diagnosis of HF, these reviews fail to explicate and summarize older patients' subjective and lived experience of the condition, which restrains us from providing a complete picture of the illness trajectory. The purpose of this integrative review was to explore and summarize the current literature examining self-reported symptoms, illness experience, and self-care management in older patients with HF.
   Design and Methods: Combinations of search terms related to illness experience, symptoms, and self-care management in HF were used to search three electronic databases. Inclusion criteria were empirical studies, published in English between 2001 and 2011, in populations of older patients (>= 75 years) investigated in relation to a self-reported subjective experience of HF. The search initially yielded 279 results; 23 qualitative and qualitative studies met the inclusion criteria.
   Findings and Conclusions: Older patients with HF have poor health-related quality of life compared with controls and experience severe and frequent symptoms of fatigue and dyspnea that limit several aspects of their life, making them dependent on others for survival. The variety of ways in which older patients cope with these consequences is determined by how they understand their illness, with the majority showing poor health literacy in relation to HF. Neither self-management nor symptom monitoring is ideal in older patients with HF, although person-centered interventions such as motivational interviewing show promising results in improving self-efficacy in this age group. Studies examining older patients' personal experiences of HF and the relationships between symptoms, situational antecedents, and social ties will fill a gap in the literature.
   Clinical Relevance: Older patients have special care needs caused by their HF and other chronic conditions, coupled with those of great age. When symptoms of HF exacerbate, older patients are predominantly admitted to geriatric care rather than cardiac care units, implying restricted access to specialized treatment. Little is still known about the basis for self-care abilities from both healthcare provider and patient perspectives.

AB Peer health coaching is an effective method of enhancing self-management support in patients with diabetes. It is unclear whether peer health coaching is equally beneficial to all patients with poor glycemic control, or is most effective for subgroups of patients.
   To examine whether the effect of peer health coaching on hemoglobin A1c (A1c) is modified by characteristics that are known to be associated with diabetes control.
   Sub-group analyses of randomized control trial.
   Two hundred and ninety nine patients with diabetes receiving care in public health clinics who participated in a randomized controlled trial of peer health coaches.
   We examined whether the association between study group and change in A1c was modified by differences in patients' demographic, behavioral or psychosocial characteristics. Analyses were adjusted for co-variables associated with change in A1c.
   The effect of coaching on patient A1c was modified by patients' level of self-management and degree of medication adherence as baseline (p = .02, and p = .03 respectively in adjusted models). For participants with "low" self-management (one standard deviation below the mean score), the usual care group experienced a slight increase in A1c (0.3 %), while the health coaching group experienced a decrease (-0.9 %). For participants with "high" self-management (one standard deviation above the mean score), both groups experienced a similar decrease in A1c (usual care group: -1.0 %; health coaching group: -1.1 %). Participants with "low" medication adherence in the usual care group experienced an increase in A1c (0.5 %), while the health coaching group experienced a decrease (-0.8 %). Participants with "high" medication adherence experienced similar decreases (usual care group: -1.1 %; health coaching group: -1.3 %).
   Peer health coaching had a larger effect on lowering A1c in patients with low levels of medication adherence and self-management support than in patients with higher levels. Peer health coaching interventions may be most effective if targeted to high-risk patients with diabetes with poor glycemic control and with poor self-management and medication adherence.

AB Objectives To examine the effect of the relationship between literacy and other individual-level factors on having an advance directive (AD). Design Face-to-face structured interview. Setting Participants were recruited from an academic general internal medicine clinic and one of four federally qualified health centers in Chicago. Participants Seven hundred eighty-four adults aged 55 to 74. Measurements Assessment of participant literacy, sociodemographic factors, and having an AD for medical care. Results One-eighth (12.4%) of participants with low literacy, 26.6% of those with marginal literacy, and 49.5% of those with adequate literacy reported having an AD (P<.001). In multivariable analyses, literacy and race were independently associated with less likelihood of having an AD. Specifically, participants with limited literacy (risk ratio (RR)=0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.220.95) and African Americans (RR=0.64, 95% CI=0.470.88) were less likely to have an AD. Exploratory analyses showed that there was not a significant interaction between the effect of literacy and race. Conclusion Limited literacy and African-American race were significant risk factors for not having an AD in this cohort of older adults. Literacy and race probably represent two separate but important causal pathways that need to be understood to improve how the healthcare system ascertains and protects individuals' advance care preferences.

AB BACKGROUND: Successful bowel preparation is important for safe, efficacious, cost-effective colonoscopy procedures; however, poor preparation is common.
   OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether there was an association between health literacy and comprehension of typical written instructions on how to prepare for a colonoscopy to enable more targeted interventions in this area.
   DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional observational study.
   SETTING: This study was performed at primary care clinics and federally qualified health centers in Chicago, Illinois.
   PATIENTS: Seven hundred sixty-four participants (mean age, 63 years; SD, 5.42) were recruited. The sample was from a mixed sociodemographic background, and 71.9% of the participants were classified as having adequate health literacy scores.
   INTERVENTION: Seven hundred sixty-four participants were presented with an information leaflet outlining the bowel preparatory instructions for colonoscopy.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Five questions were used to assess participants' comprehension of the instructions in an "open book" test.
   RESULTS: Comprehension scores on the bowel preparation items were low. The mean number of items correctly answered was 3.2 (SD, 1.2) of a possible 5. Comprehension scores overall and for each individual item differed significantly by health literacy level (all p < 0.001). After controlling for sex, age, race, socioeconomic status, and previous colonoscopy experience in a multivariable model, health literacy was a significant predictor of comprehension (inadequate vs adequate: beta = -0.2; p < 0.001; marginal vs adequate: beta = -0.2; p < 0.001).
   LIMITATIONS: The outcome represents a simulated task and not actual comprehension of preparation instructions for participants' own recommended behavior.
   CONCLUSIONS: Comprehension of a written colonoscopy preparation leaflet was generally low and significantly lower among people with low health literacy. Poor comprehension has implications for the safety and economic impact of gastroenterological procedures such as colonoscopy. Therefore, future interventions should aim to improve comprehension of complex medical information by reducing literacy-related barriers.

TI What is a mental illness? Public views and their effects on attitudes

DE Diagnostic label; mental illness; attitudes; stigma; social distance
ID HEALTH PROBLEMS; HELP-SEEKING; STIGMA; DEPRESSION; DISORDERS;

AB Objective: 'Mental illness' is a common label. However, the general public may or may not consider various conditions, ranging from major psychiatric disorders to stress, as mental illnesses. It is unclear how such public views affect attitudes towards people with mental illness and reactions to one's own potential mental illness, e.g. in terms of help-seeking or disclosure.
   Methods: In representative English population surveys the classification of six conditions (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, drug addiction, stress, grief) as a mental illness was assessed as well as attitudes towards, and contact with, people with mental illness, intentions to disclose a mental illness and to seek treatment.
   Results: A factor analysis of how strongly respondents perceived the six conditions as a mental illness yielded two factors: (i) major psychiatric disorders and (ii) stress- and behaviour-related conditions including drug addiction. In regression analyses, higher scores on the first, but not the second, factor predicted less perceived responsibility of people with mental illness for their actions, and more support for a neurobiological illness model and help-seeking. Classifying stress-related/behaviour-related conditions as mental illnesses, as well as not referring to major psychiatric disorders as mental illnesses, was associated with more negative attitudes and increased social distance, but also with stronger intentions to disclose a mental illness to an employer. Negative attitudes and social distance were also related to ethnic minority status and lower social grade. Conclusions: Referring to major psychiatric disorders as mental illnesses may reflect higher mental health literacy, better attitudes towards people with mental illness and help-seeking. A broader concept of mental illness could, although increasing negative attitudes, facilitate disclosure in the workplace. Public views on what is a mental illness may have context-dependent effects and should be taken into account in anti-stigma campaigns.

AB Aim and objective.
   The objective of this study was to analyse the associations between health literacy, health status and health-promoting behaviours among Taiwan adolescents.
   Background.
   Limited health literacy is associated with poor health outcomes such as low use of preventive services, poor self-reported health conditions and absence of health-promoting behaviours in adults. However, these factors have not been analysed in adolescents. The associations between health literacy and health outcome in adolescents provide helpful insights in conducting health education programmes for health professionals.
   Design.
   A cross-sectional survey.
   Methods.
   The survey analysed a purposive sample of 1601 senior/vocational high school students from six counties in Taiwan. Data for health literacy and health-promoting behaviours were collected by the Chinese version (short form) of the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adolescents (c-sTOFHLAd) and health-promoting behaviour scale with subscales for the following health-promoting behaviours: nutrition, exercise, stress management, interpersonal relations, health responsibility and self-actualisation.
   Results.
   Adolescents with low health literacy were less likely to perceive good health status [adjusted odd ratio, (AOR) = 0 center dot 59, 95%CI = 0 center dot 41-0 center dot 86] and less likely to exhibit health-promoting behaviours (AOR = 0 center dot 58, 95%CI = 0 center dot 39-0 center dot 86) than those with high health literacy were, especially in nutrition (AOR = 0 center dot 62, 95%CI = 0 center dot 43-0 center dot 89) and interpersonal relations (AOR = 0 center dot 61, 95%CI = 0 center dot 43-0 center dot 87) subscales. Adolescents with high and low health literacy did not significantly differ in the following health-promoting behaviours: exercise, stress management, health responsibility and self-actualisation.
   Conclusion.
   Health literacy is vital for promoting health in adolescents, especially in the domains of nutrition and interpersonal relations.
   Relevance to clinical practice.
   Health professionals should conduct health literacy assessments for adolescents prior to designing health education programmes for those with low health literacy to develop health literacy skills as to perform health promoting behaviours.

AB Objective: The present study examined knowledge of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and factors related to the disease knowledge among Korean American immigrants.
   Methods: Two-hundred and nine middle-aged and older Korean American immigrants completed a self-administered questionnaire.
   Results: Korean American immigrants had strong stigma about AD and interpreted the disease as a form of insanity. They considered memory loss and AD as a part of the aging process. They seriously lacked knowledge about the treatment, diagnosis and cause of AD. Those who were less acculturated and less exposed to AD were likely to have poorer AD knowledge.
   Conclusions: There is a need to expand AD education efforts among Korean American immigrants because the views of stigmatization and normalization of AD combined with certain Asian cultural norms can be barriers to early recognition and intervention. Our study suggests knowledge areas of concentration in AD education and a segment of the population that AD education should target. Further research on symptom knowledge by the disease stages and causal beliefs is needed to better understand the existing views about AD in Korean American immigrants.

AB Health literacy (HL) affects adult asthma management, yet less is known about how parent HL affects child asthma care.
   Objective: To examine associations between parent HL and measures related to child asthma.
   Methods: Parents of 499 school-age urban children with persistent asthma in Rochester, New York completed home interviews. Measures: the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) for parent HL: National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) criteria for asthma severity, and validated measures of asthma knowledge, beliefs, and experiences. Analyses: bivariate and multivariate analyses of associations between parent HL measures related to child asthma.
   Results: Response rate: 72%, mean child age: 7.0 years. Thirty-two percent had a Hispanic parent; 88% had public insurance. Thirty-three percent had a parent with limited HL. Low parent HL was independently associated with greater parent worry, parent perception of greater asthma burden, and lower parent-reported quality of life. Measures of health care use (e.g., emergency care and preventive medicines) were not associated with parent HL.
   Conclusions: Parents with limited HL worried more and perceived greater overall burden from the child's asthma, even though reported health care use did not vary.
   Practice implications: Improved parent understanding and provider-parent communication about child asthma could reduce parent-perceived asthma burden, alleviate parent worry, and improve parent quality of life. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID HEALTH-CARE
AB Objective. To design, implement, and evaluate a course on health promotion and literacy.
   Design. Course objectives such as the development of cultural competency skills, awareness of personal biases, and appreciation of differences in health beliefs among sociocultural groups were addressed using a team-based learning instructional strategy. Student learning outcomes were enhanced using readiness assessment tests (RATs), group presentations, portfolio reflections, and panel discussions.
   Assessment. Comparing precourse and postcourse Inventory for Assessing the Process of Cultural Competence among Healthcare Professionals (IAPCC-R) scores and portfolio responses indicated enhanced progress toward cultural competency. The Student Evaluation of Teaching ( SET) provided suggestions for course enhancements.
   Conclusions. Evidence supporting enhanced cultural competency after completing the course affirms its value as we prepare pharmacy students to provide patient-centered care in a culturally diverse world.

AB Hypertension is a major modifiable risk factor for stroke, congestive heart failure, and end-stage renal disease. Hypertension is particularly prevalent and deadly among African Americans. Effective treatment for hypertension has been available for decades, yet only one fourth of all individuals have their blood pressure under control. Despite the potential impact of hypertension, interventions to improve control have had limited success. We present a model of how to understand antecedents of blood pressure control according to three interrelated categories: patient characteristics, social and cultural environment, and medical environment. This theoretical paper was conducted using a literature review and a model to explain psychosocial antecedents of blood pressure control is presented. We conclude that improved understanding of important antecedents of blood pressure control coupled with technological advances, such as tailored interventions, provide clinicians with a tool that may lead to improved blood pressure control. These interventions will require the involvement of clinicians and consideration of sociocultural factors to be successful.

AB Background: Chronic disease patients are affected by low computer and health literacy, which negatively affects their ability to benefit from access to online health information.
   Objective: To estimate reliability and confirm model specifications for eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) scores among chronic disease patients using Classical Test (CTT) and Item Response Theory techniques.
   Methods: A stratified sample of Black/African American (N = 341) and Caucasian (N = 343) adults with chronic disease completed an online survey including the eHEALS. Item discrimination was explored using bi-variate correlations and Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency. A categorical confirmatory factor analysis tested a one-factor structure of eHEALS scores. Item characteristic curves, in-fit/outfit statistics, omega coefficient, and item reliability and separation estimates were computed.
   Results: A 1-factor structure of eHEALS was confirmed by statistically significant standardized item loadings, acceptable model fit indices (CFI/TLI>0.90), and 70% variance explained by the model. Item response categories increased with higher theta levels, and there was evidence of acceptable reliability (omega = 0.94; item reliability = 89; item separation = 8.54).
   Conclusion: eHEALS scores are a valid and reliable measure of self-reported eHealth literacy among Internet-using chronic disease patients. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID CARE; TRIAL
AB Objective: The goals of this study were to identify the demands associated with using electronic personal health records (PHRs) and to evaluate the ability of adults of lower socioeconomic status and low health literacy to use PHRs to perform health management activities.
   Background: PHRs are proliferating in clinical practices and health care organizations. These systems offer the potential of increasing the active involvement of patients in health self-management. However, little is known about the actual usability of these tools for health consumers.
   Method: We used task analysis and health literacy load analysis to identify the cognitive and literacy demands inherent in the use of PHRs and evaluated the usability of three currently available PHR systems with a sample of 54 adults. Participants used the systems to perform tasks related to medication management, interpretation of lab/test results, and health maintenance. Data were also gathered on the participants' perception of the potential value of using a PHR.
   Results: The results indicated that a majority of the participants had difficulty completing the tasks and needed assistance. There was some variability according to task and PHR system. However, most participants perceived the use of PHRs as valuable.
   Conclusions: Although considered a valuable tool by consumers, the use of PHR systems may be challenging for many people. Strategies are needed to enhance the usability of these systems, especially for people with low literacy, low health literacy, or limited technology skills.
   Application: The data from this study have implications for the design of PHRs.

AB Objective: We conducted a study to identify barriers to, and factors promoting, self-care among heart failure (HF) patients with higher or lower levels of knowledge. Method: Baseline data from 612 patients with HF enrolled in the REMOTE-HF trial were analyzed. Using median splits on the HF Knowledge Scale and the European HF Self-Care Behavior Scale, patients were divided into four groups: (a) low knowledge and good self-care, (b) low knowledge and poor self-care, (c) high knowledge and good self-care, and (d) high knowledge and poor self-care. Characteristics of the groups were compared using ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and chi-square tests, followed by pairwise tests with Bonferroni correction. Variables significant in the univariate analyses were evaluated as predictors of self-care using hierarchical multiple linear regression. The potential moderating effect of knowledge was tested with interaction terms. Results: The four groups did not differ in sociodemographics or health literacy scores, but differed in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, comorbidities, and scores on depression, anxiety, and perceived control. In post hoc pairwise tests, patients with high knowledge and poor self-care tended to have worse NYHA class, greater depression and anxiety, and lower levels of perceived control than others. In the multivariate analysis, knowledge, depressive symptoms, and perceived control were significant predictors of self-care, as was the interaction between knowledge and anxiety. Conclusions: Screening and treatment of depression and anxiety is important in improving self-care among HF patients. HF management programs need to include strategies for increasing patients' perceived control over their heart disease.

AB Aims.
   To examine stigma- and knowledge-related barriers to help-seeking among members of the general population.
   Methods.
   In a representative survey of young to middle-aged Swiss adults (n=8875), shame about a potential own mental illness, perceived knowledge about and satisfaction with one's mental health, psychiatric symptoms and attitudes towards help-seeking were assessed.
   Results.
   A latent profile analysis of all participants yielded two groups with different attitudes towards help-seeking. Relative to the majority, a one-in-four subgroup endorsed more negative attitudes towards seeking professional help, including psychiatric medication, and was characterized by more shame, less perceived knowledge, higher satisfaction with their mental health, younger age, male gender and lower education. Among participants with high symptom levels (n=855), a third subgroup was reluctant to seek help in their private environment and characterized by high symptoms as well as low satisfaction with their mental health.
   Conclusions.
   Shame as an emotional proxy of self-stigma as well as poor subjective mental health literacy may be independent barriers to help-seeking. Interventions to increase mental health service use could focus on both variables and on those individuals with more negative views about professional help, in the general public as well as among people with a current mental illness.

AB Aim: The degree to which bipolar disorder is stigmatised by the public and the extent of internalised stigma for people with this disorder, their families, and carers has been a relatively neglected area of research. This review aimed to determine what is currently known about stigma and bipolar disorder.
   Method: A systematic search of the literature was conducted to identify publications which investigated public attitudes and/or beliefs about bipolar disorder or explored internalised stigma in bipolar disorder. The electronic databases PsychINFO, Medline, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for articles published between 1992 and 2012.
   Results: Twenty five articles met the reviews inclusion criteria. There are inconsistent findings regarding public stigma, although there is some evidence that bipolar disorder is viewed more positively than schizophrenia and less positively than depression. There is a moderate to high degree of internalised stigma in bipolar disorder, although the literature raises questions regarding its ubiquity in this population.
   Limitations: Limiting the search by year of publication and excluding studies where stigma was not the main focus could mean stigma has wider implications than were identified.
   Conclusions: This review is the first systematic synthesis of research relating to stigma and bipolar disorder. In comparison to research on other mental health problems, there is a dearth of literature exploring stigma in bipolar disorder. The literature is largely inconclusive. Future research is needed to replicate tentative findings and address methodological limitations before the field can move on to the development of anti-stigma interventions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Limited health literacy is a barrier for understanding health information and has been identified as a risk factor for overuse of the emergency department (ED). The association of health literacy with access to primary care services in patients presenting to the ED has not been fully explored.
   Objective: To examine the relationship between health literacy, access to primary care, and reasons for ED use among adults presenting for emergency care.
   Methods: Structured interviews that included health literacy assessment were performed involving 492 ED patients at one Southern academic medical center. Unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression models assessed the relationship between health literacy and (1) access to a personal physician; (2) doctor office visits; (3) ED visits; (4) hospitalizations; and (5) potentially preventable hospital admissions.
   Results: After adjusting for sociodemographic and health status, those with limited health literacy reported fewer doctor office visits [odds ratio (OR)=0.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.4-1.0], greater ED use, (OR=1.6; 95% CI, 1.0-2.4), and had more potentially preventable hospital admissions (OR=1.7; 95% CI, 1.0-2.7) than those with adequate health literacy. After further controlling for insurance and employment status, fewer doctor office visits remained significantly associated with patient health literacy (OR=0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9). Patients with limited health literacy reported a preference for emergency care, as the services were perceived as better.
   Conclusions: Among ED patients, limited health literacy was independently associated with fewer doctor office visits and a preference for emergency care. Policies to reduce ED use should consider steps to limit barriers and improve attitudes toward primary care services.

AB Background: The prevalence and impact of long term conditions continues to rise. Care planning for people with long term conditions has been a policy priority in England for chronic disease management. However, it is not clear how care planning is currently understood, translated and implemented in primary care. This study explores experience of care planning in patients with long term conditions in three areas in England.
   Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 predominantly elderly patients with multiple long term conditions. The interviews were designed to explore variations in and emergent experiences of care planning. Qualitative analysis of interview transcripts involved reflexively coding and re-coding data into categories and themes.
   Results: No participants reported experiencing explicit care planning discussions or receiving written documentation setting out a negotiated care plan and they were unfamiliar with the term 'care planning'. However, most described some components of care planning which occurred over a number of contacts with health care professionals which we term"reactive" care planning. Here, key elements of care planning including goal setting and action planning were rare. Additionally, poor continuity and coordination of care, lack of time in consultations, and patient concerns about what was legitimate to discuss with the doctor were described.
   Conclusions: Amongst this population, elements of care planning were present in their accounts, but a structured, comprehensive process and consequent written record (as outlined in English Department of Health policy) was not evident. Further research needs to explore the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches to care planning for different patient groups.

AB Background: Patient web portals (PWPs) offer patients remote access to their medical record and communication with providers. Adults with health literacy limitations are less likely to access and use health information technology (HIT), including PWPs. In diabetes, PWP use has been associated with patient satisfaction, patient-provider communication, and glycemic control.
   Methods: Using mixed methods, we explored the relationships between health literacy, numeracy, and computer literacy and the usage of a PWP and HIT. Participants (N=61 adults with type 2 diabetes) attended focus groups and completed surveys, including measures of health literacy, numeracy, and computer anxiety (an indicator of computer literacy) and frequency of PWP and HIT use.
   Results: Computer literacy was positively associated with health literacy (r = 0.41, P < 0.001) and numeracy (r = 0.35, P < 0.001), but health literacy was not associated with numeracy. Participants with limited health literacy (23%), numeracy (43%), or computer literacy (25%) were no less likely to access PWPs or HIT, but lower health literacy was associated with less frequent use of a computer to research diabetes medications or treatments. In focus groups, participants spontaneously commented on family support when accessing and using PWPs or HIT for diabetes management.
   Conclusions: Participants reported family members facilitated access and usage of HIT, taught them usage skills, and acted as online delegates. Participant statements suggest family members may bridge the HIT "digital divide" in diabetes by helping adults access a PWP or HIT for diabetes management.

AB Over the past decade, at least 600,000 refugees from more than 60 different countries have been resettled in the United States. The personal history of a refugee is often marked by physical and emotional trauma. Although refugees come from many different countries and cultures, their shared pattern of experiences allows for some generalizations to be made about their health care needs and challenges. Before being accepted for resettlement in the United States, all refugees must pass an overseas medical screening examination, the purpose of which is to identify conditions that could result in ineligibility for admission to the United States. Primary care physicians have the opportunity to care for members of this unique population once they resettle. Refugees present to primary care physicians with a variety of health problems, including musculoskeletal and pain issues, mental and social health problems, infectious diseases, and longstanding undiagnosed chronic illnesses. Important infectious diseases to consider in the symptomatic patient include tuberculosis, parasites, and malaria. Health maintenance and immunizations should also be addressed. Language barriers, cross-cultural medicine issues, and low levels of health literacy provide additional challenges to caring for this population. The purpose of this article is to provide primary care physicians with a guide to some of the common issues that arise when caring for refugee patients. (Am Fam Physician. 2011;83(4):429-436.

AB The current study examined the features of women with bulimic-type eating disorders (n = 24) attending primary care in two smaller urban regions of the USA. The assessment included measures of eating disorder psychopathology, medical comorbidity, impairment in role functioning, potential barriers to treatment and actual use of health services. Eating disorders, primarily variants of bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder not meeting formal diagnostic criteria, were associated with marked impairment in psychosocial functioning. Although two-thirds of participants recognized a problem with their eating, less than 40% had ever sought treatment from a health professional for an eating or weight problem and only one in ten had sought such treatment from a mental health specialist. Only one-third had ever been asked about problems with eating by a primary care practitioner or other health professional. However, more than 80% had sought treatment from a health professional for symptoms of anxiety or depression. Most reported some degree of discomfort in discussing eating problems with others, and half reported that they would not be truthful about such problems if asked. Having an eating disorder was associated with several chronic medical conditions, including joint pain, gastrointestinal problems and fatigue. Although the small sample size limits any firm conclusions, the findings suggest that the health burden of bulimic-type eating disorders is substantial but remains largely hidden. Efforts may be needed to improve the eating disorders "mental health literacy" of both patients and primary care practitioners in order to facilitate early, appropriate intervention.
